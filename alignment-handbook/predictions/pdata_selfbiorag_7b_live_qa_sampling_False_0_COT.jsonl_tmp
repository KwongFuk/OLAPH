{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma.

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Trisomy 7 is a genetic disorder where there is an extra copy of the number 7 chromosome. \nThis additional genetic material can lead to various effects on the body.Some of the common features include:\n\n1.2.

{"Question": "To what extent does Effexor cause ED?", "Free_form_answer": "The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225 mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses ", "Must_have": ["Effexor (venlafaxine) has been associated with causing sexual side effects including ED.", "If a patient is concerned about the potential for ED as a side effect of taking Effexor, they should consult with their healthcare provider."], "Nice_to_have": ["The likelihood of experiencing sexual side effects varies among different types of antidepressants.", "The probability seems to be highest with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and least with atypical antidepressants."], "sample_predictions": ["If the patient experiences an intense sexual side effect from the medication, then it is likely that the medication caused the erectile dysfunction. hopefully this helps.If the patient experiences an intense sexual side effect from the medication, then it is likely that the medication caused the erectile dysfunction.In this case, the patient should consult with their physician to discuss the possibility of an alternative medication.The patient should also consider talking to a mental health professional about any emotional side effects they may be experiencing.It is important to note that not all patients will experience sexual side effects from Effexor, and the severity of the side effects can vary from person to person.It is always recommended to speak with a healthcare provider for personalized advice."], "inference_time": [3.6709415912628174], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.2074, "rouge1_r": 0.2171, "rouge1_f1": 0.2121, "rouge2_p": 0.0224, "rouge2_r": 0.0234, "rouge2_f1": 0.0229, "rougel_p": 0.1259, "rougel_r": 0.1318, "rougel_f1": 0.1288, "bleurt": 0.4085, "bert_score_p": 0.8278, "bert_score_r": 0.808, "bert_score_f1": 0.8178, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.4524}]}

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression.
