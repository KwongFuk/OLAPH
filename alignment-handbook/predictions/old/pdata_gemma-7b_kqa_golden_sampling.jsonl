And man oh man I have thought I was alone in wanting to die since March 23, 2014. 1 month before my depression started to overcome me completely. I have been searching for an answer. Have seen 5 different therapists at this point and 2 differet psychiatrists. I was I suffered a major depression disorder over 8 weeks ago. Haven't sought help. Didn't seek help. Just wreckless abandon for my self and life. Geez library talking about wanting to rob a bank in my head. Trying to get away from the world or all else. Hating people seeing them laughing or smiling about anything. I am a Senior menber at a credit union over here and I quit telling anyone. There for nobody knows. An if they do they have come to accept the angry person I've become. I have not been involved in my kids life. I barely even talk to them anymore. It all so pissed me off. I am such an ass about things. I become so bitter. I know it and I feel it. I become so fu...ing angry. I am scared of riots. I am scared of failing. I want to be like normal. To be happy. I want to be someone else. I'm mads all the time about wanting to die. Not just jump in front of a school bus die. Or a truck on the freeway and some idiot juning with someone driving drunk. No. I want to just die in my sleep. I really do. I want that wish to come true right now. I understand my wierdness being lay. I lived here for 39 yrs so I am used to everyone. But I want to die. To normal somewhere. Let someone else be me. Go to the grocery store and just let someone else checkout. I don't want to hold the door open anyone. I just want my life to be over. I don't care who care who I hurt anyone. I honestly just want to be dead. I have taken xanax pills with not effect. I am tired of being woken by my 16 year old to get him on the bus to go to highschool. I am tired of people doing stupid sh**. Like texting and driving.

It proved excellent for treating depression in women up through 4th trimester of pregnancy. This was in the early 90\u2032s\n\nNot satisfied with selling it in developing nations Bayer, alone didn\u2019t supply enough tablets to sell in the developed world. Soon enough Eli Lilly distribution chain reagents supplied the chemists and found that DuPont, a later innovator/developer condemned Lexapro for spurring cancer.\n\nRegardless, Lexapro today is still used and you can\u2019t get the environ mint brand. Talk to your pharmacist about what brand they supply. Insurance companies control brand via cargos and rebates.\n\nPlease tell me something guys, I\u2019ve been on Lexapro for 4-5 months now and over the past weeks I feel as if my spark is kind of out in life. As in no big dreams and i\u2019m focusing on real life problems which gets me down, because there is no excitement or such in my life!\n\nAs I write this I feel like crying and I\u2019m scared. I just want Lexi to do what it actually advertises, so i can enjoy life again. I\u2019ve been depressed for so long. Did I need Lexapro for this or have I made myself addicted without knowing it? Help!\n\n@mtx \u2013 I hope the treatment worked for you in the end. i agree with you about SSRI\u2019s being the ultimate cure for anxiety. unfortunately for me, unfortunately for most people, they don\u2019t completely \u201ccure\u201d me.\n\nfor now I am taking 25mg onc e/day and I think it has really helped. not as much as being on 50 mg, but 50 mg put me in a sort of porn-ferornando state of mind. it made me ache and yearn and strip and fuck and fantasise about women. and maybe the problem there is that it\u2019s not representative of the real world. I guess sometimes the real world (or the chicks in it) aren\u2019t as great as me dreaming about them.\n\nanyway, the 50mg was great except for that. right now, I\u2019m going to stick with the 25mg and see how I go.\n\nI plan to", "It\u2019s an antidepressant, and it does seem to help.\n\nThere\u2019s been studies which indicate that it\u2019s similar in efficacy to Prozac, and it\u2019s suggested that it might also be helpful in loosening the symptoms of anxiety, that Lexapro can be used for.\n\nI've taken SSRI's for 8 months and noticed that they can help a lot, at least for me.\n\nBecause i realised after a good solid long time....that i like myself a lot. That\u2019s a little different from normal people i think by what i hear...i actually felt like i liked myself after those 8 months.\n\nBecause of that... i suggested Lexapro to my mother who i don\u2019t see as a very bad person because she\u2019s been great for me ...but also as somebody with a lot of small self destructive behaviors that many if not most people with BPD have.\n\ni would consider this an extremely last resort if possible because... since i don\u2019t know exactly the circumstances of her childhood and life it would take some research and i wouldn\u2019t want to diagnose a mental illness on just that so...essentially i suggested a DONE talk because she keeps changing therapists every few months ( a bit of a vicious cycle of course) and i was hoping she could talk to someone who is literally an expert and get as objective as humanly possible.\n\nAnyway my point with all of this is that...you have to weigh in any side effects carefully at least right now because SSRIs have their own problems. Primarily in that (for me anyway) i often had panic attacks. I also took a SXRI and that was almost as bad as Dexedrine ( though i don\u2019t have ADHD just ADHD like pleasantries ) So that alll worked out but it obviously took some time to suss it all out.\n\nOne step at a time if that makes sense.\n\nBtw i am not a Doctor.\nYou can lookup tempris on Utube and a few good Lexapro versus videos to if you narrow down any questions to specifics. It's odd you can ask a Doctor about this, but not the staff here, who do know. And if it was up to me, I'd taken some Dr. Google and maybe TikTok and leave it at that, because those two sites seem to have a real handle on mental health and know what they are talking about on the subject.

{"Question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "Free_form_answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV.

Genital herpes is a virus that is known in the United States as the Herpes Simplex virus 2. It is also known overseas as herpes genitalis. It is contracted only through vaginal and anal sex. Herpes simplex will affect the genitals and the mouth. Again, it is another name for the herpes simplex virus. HPV is fundamentally different. The only way to contract genital herpes is to have sex with someone that has it. HPV is contracted by just touching the infected person.

My Dear,since it has been suggested to introduce you to bio-energy I believe that certain evidence should be given first to prove it`s effectiveness before you accept to start using it.\n\nThis should be by fighting off some of the diseases that you have in your body. If you over take all them then we will agree you are ready to start bio-energy.\n\nAs for your question. u should understand that we have a food chain on this planet. And as you are in the top of the food chain as a human being you are exposed to so much diseases than a herbivure like a cow for example which is the bottom of the food chain. So you will be exposed to the different organisms like the virus and bacterial diseases as you know the virus does not cause disease on it`s own though but cause weakening of the natural immunity whic will cause disease if not during the weakened state then latter. Same as a bacteria on it`s own does not cause no infection but cause no infection but while it is in a foreign body it wil cause infection by weakening the natural immunity. As our natural immunity is always fighting disease all the time beating them during it`s game. The illnesses that we see are very few only because our natural immunity kicks in and beats them as they come for the purpose they were created to produce.So if you drink water your natural immunity detects the minerals in the water that are good for the body and use them in the right quantity forRefreshToken \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0440 our body and when there disease appear the natural immunity beat them out with the loosened or weakend cells or\n\nthey will use poison theirselves. The virus and bacterial organisms never have planned to cause human beings diseases but it`s our lifestyle that is encouraging the virus and bacterial diseases. as we have done the mistake of polluting the natural ecosystem of the world. So all those virus diseases will appear form time to time in us until we make our natural ecosystem right. Such are aids and all the other STDs.

As a child, I loved snacks. PB&J sandwiches coming back from the field ended up in my lunchbox between two chips -- that's right, I ate the bread, so I'd be loaded up on deliciousness. Come home, and I'd be eyeing the loaf of bread....tow-to-awe. And another sandwich was easy to make. And I'd go to the pantry and maybe find another. It was like greased lightning -- and no one was on to me. I mean, who doesn't make sandwiches for themselves? My father would be chiding me for years about my ripe mashed banana addiction. Come back from a trip and empty the contents of my suitcase onto my kin who was there at the time -- wanting to know what I bought myself. She would uncover looks of enjoyment before she noticed the empty TP tube between my thigh.\n\nI had to do get a handle on Snacking in order to get back on my path -- Aoproach Path, not a self imposed death sentence. But, it took a few ideas to get there\n\n1.) Make your own dessert -- in the terms of this how long have I been making my own trail mixes?? How much have I spent on expensive bags of tasteless chemicals in crunchy bags, and mixes that kicked off with that new car smell??\n\n2.) Buy a LOT of Chipits -- the wheat/rice cookies with chocolate chips -- best with 2% milk. Like $5 for a large bag, so much more cost effective!!\n\n3.) Preserve all Addsy things -- Nutty things, do you have any idea that a peanut butter gift pack is probably $10 extra on top of Skittles or chocolate??\n\n4.) Peanut Butter -- I really don't necessarily NEED peanut butter on stuff, unless I want to make it taste like PB&J and it's not a sandwich. But, any way that I can minimize the portion, the alcohol is metho, the sugar and calories go with it. And if I can use it less, that's more time I'll be eating salted almonds....\n\n5.) Lunchables -- Now I know this doesn't crush the enemy, and my guess is this is an enemy of... all enemies, but hey, this one actually solves for cost, and the lesson is I learn how to prefer something more than a sandwich. I just make sandwiches\n\n6.)

{"Question": "Anything I can do for the congestion?", "Free_form_answer": "Yes, there are several medicines and home treatments that can help relieve congestion.\n\nNasal corticosteroid sprays reduce inflammation and swelling in the nose. Some are available over-the-counter and they are recommended for the treatment of persistent nasal allergy symptoms.\nNasal antihistamine sprays may also help relieve congestion. \n\nNasal decongestant sprays can be beneficial for reducing the swelling of the blood vessels and tissues within the nasal passages. However, they should not be used for more than 2-3 days at a time. Frequent or prolonged use can cause \"rebound congestion\" when the decongestant is stopped, which can lead to a cycle of dependency on decongestant sprays. Their short-term use means they are better for treating nasal congestion caused by a cold rather than allergies.\n\nNasal irrigation or saline sprays can rinse out mucus and allergens from the nasal passages. Elevation of the head at night may help as congestion is sometimes worse when lying down.\n\nOral decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), are also available.

Lutein is famously good for vision too particularly when it comes to age-related problems because Lutein is integrated into the membranes of the cells and tissues that make up the retina.

This tear film helps your eyes stay lubricated and is also particularly important when the eyes are becoming dry and irritated, especially during the winter months and times of heating.\n\nIf you find yourself with dry eyes because of the tears failing to lubricate properly then you should look at supplementing with omega 3 .

The flu", "The flu, also referred to as influenza, is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses that attack the respiratory system. These viruses circulate year-round, but their seasons typically overlap with other viruses that cause similar symptoms. Viral respiratory infections such as the common cold and the flu are abundant during the winter months, making it difficult to differentiate between them. The symptoms overlap, which brings up even more confusion and is why people often call these viruses the stomach flu. But technically, the stomach flu is not the same as the flu.\n\nCookie-cutter responses just don\u2019t satisfy most patients. Get the right answer, the first time.\n\nThese two viruses have similar symptoms, but they actually come from different infection categories. Technically, the stomach flu is a collection of symptoms known as acute gastroenteritis, from the belly or \u201cgastro,\u201d plus the bowel or \u201centero,\u201d which affects the stomach and small intestines.\n\nOriginally, the term stomach flu was applied to gastrointestinal symptoms caused by Norwalk-like viruses, strains of norovirus that cause acute gastroenteritis. Originally thought to be caused by the flu, it was what they called it because its symptoms mirrored those that caused the flu. The stomach flu, or acute gastroenteritis, is caused by a virus or bacteria that affects the lining of the stomach and small intestine.\n\nGastroenteritis can be caused by norovirus, rotavirus, E. coli, and a variety of other germs. Extreme bowel pain and diarrhea are usually indicative of severe gastroenteritis that requires immediate medical attention. Stomachaches are more common with the common cold, which typically causes mild intestinal distress. When acute gastroenteritis is severe, fever and vomiting are common symptoms, typically followed by diarrhea and stomach pain. In order to make a treatment plan, a doctor should determine if the patient has the flu or a virus that is causing the stomach flu.\n\nBoth gastrointestinal and influenza viruses can cause severe illness, a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. These viruses are also very contagious; it only takes a small sample of contaminated fluid from the respiratory, intestinal, or throat systems to spread the disease to other people or from person to person. People with gastrointestinal infections experience weakened immune systems, which makes it easy for flu viruses and other germs to enter the body easily. Both of these illnesses can trigger stool sample and blood tests. If a patient shows signs of severe dehydration, they will be immediately admitted to a hospital and treated for dehydration and medical conditions that result from severe dehydration.\n\nSince the flu and", "Doctors can\u2019t seem to agree on what\u2019s happening in Texas right now with enterovirus D68, so they\u2019re calling the virus different names. But what we know for sure is that kids and teens are falling ill with respiratory problems from EV-D68.\n\nWhatever you know it as\u2014the stomach flu, summer flu, or EV-D68\u2014the one thing that\u2019s for certain is Texarkana and surrounding areas like Longview and Marshall, Texas, are being hit hard.\n\n<h2>So What Exactly is EV-D68?</h2>\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about the 12 states that are currently dealing with this virus; these states are:\n\n* Colorado\n* Indiana\n* Illinois\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Michigan\n* Missouri\n* Nebraska\n* New York\n* Ohio\n* Virginia\n* Wisconsin\n\nBut what is this virus and why is it so damaging to the respiratory system? EV-D68 is a viral infection that resembles the \u201ccommon cold\u201d for adults, but for kids it\u2019s dangerous. According to the CDC, there haven\u2019t been any deaths, but children in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma are being exposed to the virus and suffering from similar symptoms of paralysis from a respiratory disease known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).\n\n<h2>Schools Start Making Moves</h2>\n\nAlthough cases of EV68 have been confirmed in only a few states, precautionary measures are being taken so students and teachers are free of the virus. In Alabama, the school district has rearranged the student schedule; starting on November 16th, school will be in session for only 3 days per week. While this change may seem awkward, it\u2019s better for the students to be safe and recover from the virus than to stay in class.\n\n<h2>Preventing EV68</h2>\n\nSince EV-D68 is spread by respiratory and water droplets, the best thing you can do is to avoid contact by washing your hands after using a common area. That means using the toilet or wiping your nose, then immediately washing your hands before you head back to a classroom.\n\n<h2>The First Signs of EV68</h2>\n\nParents, know what to look for: the symptoms of EV-D68 usually last less than two weeks, but typical flu-like symptoms can follow. Parents and educators should be on the lookout for the following symptoms:\n\n* Respiratory infections\n* Fever\n* Headache\n* Joint pain\n* Muscle pain", "Not fully. But... when it comes to physical and mental toll, the stomach flu wins. The stomach flu is not caused by influenza, but rather a stomach virus, is spread the same way as the influenza virus and is very uncomfortable.\n\nThe stomach flu is an illness that affects the intestines, stomach, and the digestive system. It is also called gastroenteritis which is referred to the inflammation of the gastrointestinal organs. The virus causes the stomach to have fluids that are either runny or watery from vomiting and diarrhea. The most common symptoms of the flu include diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and stomach cramps. The stomach flu can be severe and last for more than a week and this is where medication like medicine comes into place. It is crucial to take fluids to replace the body fluids lost through stomach vomiting and diarrhea. Although the discomforts caused by the stomach flu are bad during daytime, they are avoidable during the night. To ease the discomfort caused by the stomach flu, there are some proven science-backed methods to follow including:\n\n1. Make sure you don't drink more water than you need. There is no need to chug a gallon of water before bedtime. While it may seem slightly smarter to drink heavy fluids to lessen the need to get up and use the bathroom at night, it might end up backfiring on you. Being fatally dehydrated is never good and resulting in requiring an emergency ambulance in the middle of the cold night. The sickness will pass eventually; there's no need to speed the process along by making yourself need a run to the bathroom in the middle of the night.\n\n2. Avoid Alcohol: Alcohol is a diuretic. It is easy to get dehydrated after taking alcohol, making it a poor option in the middle of your spree even if you are not afflicted by a cold. But for a person who is already dehydrated by colds or flu is even more problematic; this can mean that alcohol in any quantities is a poor idea. Since hangover is a worse condition, it's better to avoid it until you are at a full strength again.\n\n3. Get Plenty of Sleep: No matter what ails your body, rest is usually the best medicine. Sleep is essential in all sorts of bodily recuperation. In such a condition, you should communicate with your boss and let them know you are sick and need your time to recuperate. Let your near surroundings know you need to rest and keep the distraction away to get the restful bout you need. You should get all the rest you can when you are sick,", "And if not, what is the actual difference between a flu and the stomach flu? While they share the word \u201cflu\u201d in common, these two are actually different infections.\n\n<strong>The \u201cstomach flu,\u201d most likely to be diagnosed as gastroenteritis, differs from the flu in several aspects.</strong>\n\nWhile a \u201cstomach flu\u201d infection will more often lead you to the bathroom with diarrhea, the flu will wreak havoc on your respiratory system. Worsening the sufferer\u2019s pre-existing asthma condition or instead leading to asthma onset, influenza is considered a leading cause of asthma morbidity.\n\n<h2><strong>Causes of Stomach Flu</strong></h2>\n\n<strong>Gastroenteritis is an umbrella term that refers to inflammation of the stomach and large or small bowel.</strong>\nThis inflammation can primarily be of bacteriological or viral origin, or sometimes a mixture of those two causes.\n\nColonial-specific disease, most likely acquiring its nickname the \u201cstomach flu\u201d from misconceptions by patients, is a common ailment that affects both children and adults. It often leads to difficulties with digestion, bouts of vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\n<strong>Two bacteria responsible for gastroenteritis are called Campylobacter and Salmonella.</strong> The latter is the most common cause of the disease worldwide. Campylobacter is also common, especially in countries with more primitive sanitation habits.\n\nNorovirus and rotavirus are responsible for gastroenteritis in their regions. Rotavirus is most pathogenic to infants and young children in their first year of life. Few healthy adults without weakened immune systems get rotavirus infections.\n\nPatients with gastroenteritis often develop hypovolemia. The reason is due to an excess amount of gastrointestinal fluid lost when you are worried if the stomach flu patient won\u2019t keep fluids down. Doctors should treat patients with high suspicion for sepsis and acute kidney impairment, while waiting for full laboratory results.\n\n<strong>Microscopic organisms C. jejuni and Salmonella are responsible for the stomach flu.</strong>\n\nSalmonella seems to induce a greater proportional loss of fluid because of the volume of stools in the gut that you were throwing up to.\n\nCampylobacter is capable of making you vomit, which leads it to be responsible for up to 0.7% of all emergency department visits in the U.S.A.\n\n<h2><strong>Symptoms Of Stomach Flu</strong></h2>\n\nGastroenteritis symptoms can include nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, mild fever, and headache. These symptoms can get worse within 24 hours after infection.\n\nThese symptoms tend", "While they share some similarities, both illnesses are caused by different germs. Here\u2019s what you need to know to stay healthy\u2014and what to do if you start experiencing stomach flu symptoms.\n\n<h2>What is the stomach flu?</h2>\n\nThe term \u201cstomach flu\u201d is an informal way of referring to a viral infection affecting the digestive system. Though the term does get thrown around in casual conversation, it isn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as \u201cflu\u201d in the stomach, because the virus that causes the flu isn\u2019t directly involved in this condition.\n\nRather, the flu falls under a separate family of viruses called influenza viruses. All strains of influenza affect the respiratory system, appearing in symptoms like a cough, sore throat, difficulties breathing, and high fever.\n\nThe stomach flu doesn\u2019t come from the flu or any of this family of viruses. The commonly-used label applies only to a digestion-related concern.\n\n<h2>Is the stomach flu contagious?</h2>\n\nNo, the stomach flu is not an infectious illness. However, people with stomach flu tend to stay in bed with abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. If you\u2019re experiencing these stomach flu symptoms, you should practice separating yourself from others so that they won\u2019t become infected with a more directly contagious issue\u2014like a cold or the flu.\n\n<h2>What causes the stomach flu?</h2>\n\nThe yeast <em>Candida</em> is believed to be the primary catalyst behind stomach flu symptoms. This is blood-based fungus found in saliva, sweat, feces and urine.\n\nHumans carry this yeast with them in the mucus membranes at the base (odors may become apparent if the yeast side-effect goes unchecked). This powerless fungus goes dormant, but it can become activated in stressful situations, like physical activity or sexual contact.\n\nIt can also be triggered by candida associated yeast overgrowth in the intestines.\n\nThat\u2019s often a concern when we talk about the digestive system as a whole, but it isn\u2019t relevant in all instances of stomach flu. Yeast overgrowth languages which lead to fermentation produce acute fermentation symptoms, painful diarrhea that can exhaust the body, and a sense of bloating that can hinder the ability to absorb nutrients in the same way the body normally does it.\n\nAnother major reason behind the stomach flu is bacterial overgrowth. It\u2019s a general term that refers to a few different concerns, but in most cases, it refers to a loss of balance in the body\u2019s microbiome.\n\nThe most common cause of"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6667, "rouge1_r": 0.0972, "rouge1_f1": 0.1696, "rouge2_p": 0.2321, "rouge2_r": 0.0333, "rouge2_f1": 0.0583, "rougel_p": 0.4737, "rougel_r": 0.0691, "rougel_f1": 0.1205, "bleurt": 0.4277, "bert_score_p": 0.7895, "bert_score_r": 0.8782, "bert_score_f1": 0.8315, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.7368, "rouge1_r": 0.0988, "rouge1_f1": 0.1743, "rouge2_p": 0.1607, "rouge2_r": 0.0212, "rouge2_f1": 0.0375, "rougel_p": 0.4912, "rougel_r": 0.0659, "rougel_f1": 0.1162, "bleurt": 0.322, "bert_score_p": 0.8095, "bert_score_r": 0.8741, "bert_score_f1": 0.8406, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4737, "rouge1_r": 0.0712, "rouge1_f1": 0.1239, "rouge2_p": 0.125, "rouge2_r": 0.0185, "rouge2_f1": 0.0323, "rougel_p": 0.3158, "rougel_r": 0.0475, "rougel_f1": 0.0826, "bleurt": 0.2863, "bert_score_p": 0.7643, "bert_score_r": 0.8402, "bert_score_f1": 0.8005, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 25.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5439, "rouge1_r": 0.069, "rouge1_f1": 0.1225, "rouge2_p": 0.1786, "rouge2_r": 0.0223, "rouge2_f1": 0.0397, "rougel_p": 0.386, "rougel_r": 0.049, "rougel_f1": 0.087, "bleurt": 0.3114, "bert_score_p": 0.7943, "bert_score_r": 0.882, "bert_score_f1": 0.8359, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6667, "rouge1_r": 0.0948, "rouge1_f1": 0.1659, "rouge2_p": 0.1786, "rouge2_r": 0.025, "rouge2_f1": 0.0439, "rougel_p": 0.4737, "rougel_r": 0.0673, "rougel_f1": 0.1179, "bleurt": 0.3325, "bert_score_p": 0.7857, "bert_score_r": 0.8612, "bert_score_f1": 0.8217, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.7193, "rouge1_r": 0.0969, "rouge1_f1": 0.1708, "rouge2_p": 0.2143, "rouge2_r": 0.0284, "rouge2_f1": 0.0502, "rougel_p": 0.3509, "rougel_r": 0.0473, "rougel_f1": 0.0833, "bleurt": 0.315, "bert_score_p": 0.7923, "bert_score_r": 0.8728, "bert_score_f1": 0.8306, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

My dog is running around very normally now and seems to be ok, but I just wanted to be sure he was ok.\n\nSo, after talking to my vet, I learned all the praises about Robaxin and was informed that I over suspected that anything was wrong with my dog, Kylogh.

The plant is most commonly known for its use in the floor mill thanks to its demand by floor millers for the production of stained glass, with the Colchis part of the name referring to the mythical Colchis Kingdom that\u2019s the origin of the plant.\n\nColchicine has also been used for a great deal of time to treat inflammatory illnesses, particularly gout, and is also used in anti-implantation, to prevent heart transplant rejection and disorders that can cause genetic complications. \n\nAlex Langford, co-founder of flooring company Real Engineered Floors, explains, \u201cColchicine is a drug taken to prevent floor millers from getting common suffering of \u2018White Finger\u2019, where weakened blood vessels in the extremities cause pain and numbness, resulting in hour-long time durations until they could be cured. \n\n\u201cWith restricted dexterity and pain shooting down their limbs, (and sometimes with white staining to the skin as a consequence) \u2018White Finger\u2019 was a common complaint amongst those working with the floor mill and the use of colchicine was common place to prevent this disorder.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dr Ceri Silva-Wright, he colleague of Alex, \u2018Colchicine is still used as an anti-inflammatory drug following internal surgery or perhaps in angioplasty. My preferred drug to help unblock blood vessels, paclitaxel is used by oncologists as a chemotherapeutic agent for cancers. In the future, it will perhaps even be studied to see if it can halt the spread of cystic fibrosis\u2019.\n\nColchicine has been a major part of the history of furniture design and production, including a specific contribution to a Wallace & Sewell floor rug from 1900 called The Century Rugs, which used the colchicum daisies on a serene pale grey ground field. The Century Rugs were highly instrumental in helping Wallace & Sewell become known as modern rugs initially that grew in popularity enough to demand the creation of the Arts and Crafts Rugs by the firm.", "And what is it used for? We look at its uses and issues with toxicity. Low dose colchicine is used as a safe and effective OTC treatment of plantar fasciitis and gout. Dr Bond from Dunelm Health explains how to introduce the sensible use of colchicine for simple joint and muscle pain in adults including gout, sciatica, shin splints, tendonitis, fibrositis, bursitis, etc. Some traditional and alternative medicines have shown beneficial effects against chronic inflammatory joint and muscle pain syndromes. These medicines belong to the group of new antinflammatory drugs. While some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen are still commonly used for the treatment of chronic joint and muscles pains, several other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have severe side or toxic effects. The use of some prescription oral and intrabone drugs is not without risk of severe adverse reactions including toxic effects on the kidneys where long term use is involved. These drugs are helpful in treating osteoarthritis and have been extensively researched. NSAIDs, like dexamethasone, aspirin, and ibuprofen, provide some pain relief in these conditions but have limitations and side effects such as bleeding and gastrointestinal problems. They are also limited to short term use because of their side effects. In more serious conditions brought about by rheumatoid arthritis, such disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, otherwise known as DMARDs, are now a mainstay of treatment. Methothrexate, gold salts, and azathioprine are examples of these DMARDs. Some DMARDs are equally effective in combination with corticosteroids in places where non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs lack effectiveness. Some of these sets of drugs have significant side effects, includingStevens-Johnson syndrome, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and infectious leprosy. Colchicine is an alkaloid which helps to reduce the size of swollen joints and help preventing cell bursting. Syndenolix is a popular colchicine based homeopathic medication, which is widely used for imprough joint pain including gout, a long term severe and disabling joint disease. Colchicine actually reduces inflammation and oedema in the body. Noticeable oedema and inflammation of joints are the most visible symptoms of gout. This is the end of our guide to using colchicine for gout and other joint pain conditions. What is it? Colchicine is used for treatment of gout and related disabilityamountsboning the joints.

Intestinal obstruction would be any disturbance in the normal functioning of stool. The internal symptoms are usually demarcated by a sensation of fullness, bloating, inability to pass gas, fullness of the belly, nausea, vomitting, abdominal pain and tenderness. Diarrhea would be the frequent passage of feces that are seedy, black, poorly formed and moist or liquid. trouble with the digestive system is that people could have internal problems and not know that there anything wrong.\n\nIntestinal problems like diarrhea or constipation are prevalent among those whose digestive system is complex.

As a result, when the nurse is preparing to administer drugs, he/she should ask his/her treating physician whether he/she needs to discontinue any drug that is currently active or is supposed to administer at the same time to another patient.\n\nb) Can drugs with CNS depressing actions increase the risk of my patient?\nYes, the drug being used on CNS-potentiating patients can worsen the potency of CNS-depressing medicines if the prescription is not administered properly. Therefore, it is best that you administer each and every pill in accordance with what is being advised in the label of the prescription. If you find that there is an overlap of the condition, then you may want to talk to your physician about this.\n\nc) What need to be considered when time of administration of the drug depends on the contents of the stomach?\nWhen the patient taking the medication with food doesn't have an empty stomach, the medicine needs to be taken after eating, unlike when the patient is taking the drug with an empty stomach which may necessitate a fixed time when the medication must be taken, such as about 30 minutes before the patient eats breakfast.\n\nd) What happens if my patient is vomiting?\nIf a patient is vomiting or refuses to eat dinner, you may recommend the patient to skip their dose for that day, however, the patient should remember that stopping a medicine can result to its effects going away even sooner, which means that the patient may have to take a higher dose of the drug in order for it to work as planned.\n\nI-64411-19\n\nAnswer and Explanation:\n\na) Prior to administering any medication, the nurse should review the use or administration instructions available in the product literature, and consult the prescribing healthcare provider before the drug is given. It is also recommended to consider a patient's allergy history. Prior to giving medication, it is necessary to assess the patient and understand the reason for its use, other medicines the patient is taking, and the prescribed frequency and dosage, and interact with other medicines the patient is taking.\nb) Drugs with CNS depressant effects may inhibit", "suppose the swing rides as described are in frictionless bearings so that gravity is the only force on the moving parts\n\nA tank in a room at $19^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is initially open to the atmosphere on a day when the barometric pressure is 102 kPa.

Under normal circumstances, your body would process the sugar in your blood by converting it into energy.\n\nHowever, when your body lacks the insulin your body needs, your body can\u2019t efficiently convert the sugar into energy because it doesn\u2019t have the necessary fuel for doing so. As a result, the glucose can\u2019t be absorbed into the body much like gas left in a car. Over time, it can lead to high blood sugar (or hyperglycemia) and potentially dangerous symptoms.\n\nHigh blood sugar can lead to various side effects, including blurred vision, skin symptoms, depression, frequent urination, excessive thirst, and many more.\n\nThankfully, diabetes can be managed and kept under control by following a healthy, balanced diet tailored to your specific needs/type. If you have type 2 diabetes, your physician may recommend a low-carbohydrate diet, particularly one that is low in saturated fat. But you don\u2019t have to give up sugar completely.\n\n<h2><strong>How Much Sugar Is Too Much?</strong></h2>\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture recommends that daily sugar consumption (including fruit sugar) does not exceed 25% of daily calorie intake. For an adult dieter, that makes for roughly 100 calories of sugar per day. Considering each teaspoon equals 20 calories, that would mean a teaspoon and a half every day.\n\nBut if you have type 2 diabetes, you\u2019ll want to follow a diet centered around healthier fats\u2014such as olive oil and fish\u2014as well as a relatively low-carb diet. In other words, your daily carb intake may be as low as 30 grams per day.\n\n<h2><strong>Could Diabetic Have Sugar Cravings?</strong></h2>\n\nDiabetes can affect the brain, which is rich in insulin receptors. As a result, your brain can start demanding more sugar as it seeks treatment for the imbalance in glucose. It\u2019s especially common for diabetic women to experience cravings, thanks to hormonal fluctuations and insulin resistance.\n\n<h2><strong>Can diabetics eat sweet potatoes?</strong></h2>\n\nSweet potatoes (especially white sweet potatoes and yams) tend to have a modest glycemic index. This is good news for the diabetic, as it means that it won\u2019t impact blood sugar as much as other potato varieties. But if you\u2019re a type 2 diabetes dieter, it\u2019s wise to always monitor your portion size.", "<b>No!</b>\n\nThat is the answer from every doctor and <u>online dietitian program</u> that I have met.\n\nAnd to be honest, they all make sense. Sugars are bad! Eating too much sugary foods, will eventually give you butt cheeks like J Lo.\n\nSo, we need to find a healthy <b>alternative to sugar</b> if we want to lose weight and feel healthier.\n\nAnd there are plenty of alternatives out there that make it easier to lower the amount of sugar we eat, without compromising on taste.\n\nSo, what is up with sugar?\n\n<h1>How do we get fat off...sugar?</h1>\n\nDiabetics have a <b>problem with sugar</b>.

I would recommend deep relaxation techniques and meditation: download an app with a good sleep podcast such as Insight timer to your phone, there are some really lovely long meditations that you could try and I would recommend turning off your phone alarm and resetting it so that it will wake you during the night if necessary but not alert it.\n\nFor some people white noise helps some like me \u2013 I love listening to the sounds of a babbling brook or bubbles streaming in a stream with the occasional roar of a big rock or an underwater waterfall or a big heavy bath plug or rain and thunder and on and on and on. I would recommend trying a few of these and seeing what really chills you out? I like \u2018waves\u2019 by Susan Shorforc of singing dreams on Amazon but they have to be MP3s not streamed! I guess the key is finding what really relaxes you. Finally I would recommend a supplement such as one or two valerian tablets an hour or two before bed \u2013 made from the same plant as hops and other soothing, relaxing herbs.\n\nMontauk herbs do a very good product called Syphoze http://montaukherbs.co.uk/Try-Syphoze which you could try but always check with your doctor before you take any supplements it could interfere with any medication you are taking.

It is based on the idea that the body has the ability to heal itself. Many homeopathic remedies are inspired by nature or by substances identified in the home and the laboratory. Homeopathic practitioners of all kinds believe in the importance of balancing the mind, body, and spirit, and are committed to the power of medicines that are mild and nourishing to the body.\n\nWho is responsible for homeopathic standards?\n\nHomeopathic medicines are categorized as drugs by the FDA; companies making them must comply with stringent quality controls, and they are subject to surprise inspection by FDA Inspectors. As a result Homeopathic medicines are subjected to far greater regulation than other types of medicine including natural health products, vitamins and minerals.\n\nHow much of each active ingredient is in formula?\n\nThe active ingredients in Reliep Sleep Formula are only detected using highly sensitive gravimetric measures. These measures are beyond the ability of humans to detect manually. This is the case for years since when doctors and scientists believed that measurements were down to a new set line on a microscope didn\u2019t realise that they were just outlining what was there but not visible to other means. That is where the stereoscopic field comes in. For example blood circulation has been known to seep through veins for thousands of years with each \u201cnew\u201d invention.\n\nWill Homeopathic treatment interfere with any other medication i am taking?\n\nIt is recommended that you always speak to your medical practitioner before taking a new remedy. Sometimes certain drugs and medication for certain conditions can interfere with certain ingredients in a homeopathic remedy and they should only be taken together when a homeopathic practitioner has prescribed your remedy. It is always a good idea to review supplements and medication in close consultation with your doctor.\n\nWhen can I take Reliep Sleep Formula and for how ong?\n\nDo not take Homeopathic formulas at the sime times as coffee, tea, energy drinks or tobacco.

The bacteria haemophilus influenzae is involved in the production of the acute bacterial form of sinusitis, and so the bacterial infection of the sinus cavity is the source of the infection.\n\nThe sinusitis in elderly patients is also associated with infections acquired in hospitals. Therefore the management of sinusitis requires combination of short courses of various antibiotics, steroids and decongestants.\n\nSometimes the treatment may have to be continued for as long as four weeks. One week of untreatable sinusitis can often result in more serious illness. Co-amoxiclav as 500mg is the most effective and widely used treatment for sinusitis.

Many thanks.\n\n<strong>Answer</strong>:\nIt\u2019s great to hear about your success with Sertraline from a purely emotional standpoint. We hope to hear back from others, but since no other readers have asked this question recently, we\u2019ll have to speculate for now.\n\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to think that pre-ejaculatory hyperexcitability could benefit from Sertraline since it reduces perception (and desire) of stimuli. I doubt that it will help someone who lacks excitement, however. Impotence and early ejaculation are two different issues. Ejaculation takes place in two separate phases: opening (ejaculatory initiation) and closing (resolution). Generally, they both occur at the same time. Conversely, an inadequate erection, unable to achieve orgasm (monophase) or an even longer phase (aberrant sustained erection) each suggest one or the other phase concomitantly unnoticed; it\u2019s all psychological.*\n\nThe full list of every drug and type of medication that could encounter PE is a numericalisering we hope to work through eventually. We\u2019ve found that just about every drug has had success with \u201csomething\u201d for PE, with few that are clearly outdated (such as Amantadine). Sertraline (and Paroxetine for some) is also used by men for Peyronie\u2019s Disease (which promotes scar tissue in the corpus cavernosum that cause the penis to bow out of alignment; Sertraline works by maintaining traction on the softer tissue on either side).\n\nIn conclusion, Sertraline is relatively unlikely to produce a clean result based on what we currently know in first-hand chronic extensive research. We do think that switching planes in the above comparison (interfere in the other phase) could work effectively. If you look up where the ejaculatory muscles are located in the conglomeration of penis tissue, you can learn more.\n\nAnyway"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.2099, "rouge1_r": 0.0486, "rouge1_f1": 0.0789, "rouge2_p": 0.0625, "rouge2_r": 0.0143, "rouge2_f1": 0.0233, "rougel_p": 0.1975, "rougel_r": 0.0457, "rougel_f1": 0.0742, "bleurt": 0.4969, "bert_score_p": 0.7618, "bert_score_r": 0.8105, "bert_score_f1": 0.7854, "hallucination": 88.88888888888889, "comprehensive": 11.11111111111111}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3827, "rouge1_r": 0.0799, "rouge1_f1": 0.1322, "rouge2_p": 0.0125, "rouge2_r": 0.0026, "rouge2_f1": 0.0043, "rougel_p": 0.2593, "rougel_r": 0.0541, "rougel_f1": 0.0896, "bleurt": 0.3284, "bert_score_p": 0.7782, "bert_score_r": 0.8203, "bert_score_f1": 0.7987, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.358, "rouge1_r": 0.0799, "rouge1_f1": 0.1306, "rouge2_p": 0.025, "rouge2_r": 0.0055, "rouge2_f1": 0.009, "rougel_p": 0.1605, "rougel_r": 0.0358, "rougel_f1": 0.0586, "bleurt": 0.2814, "bert_score_p": 0.7655, "bert_score_r": 0.8278, "bert_score_f1": 0.7954, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3333, "rouge1_r": 0.0646, "rouge1_f1": 0.1082, "rouge2_p": 0.025, "rouge2_r": 0.0048, "rouge2_f1": 0.008, "rougel_p": 0.1975, "rougel_r": 0.0383, "rougel_f1": 0.0641, "bleurt": 0.2347, "bert_score_p": 0.7747, "bert_score_r": 0.7964, "bert_score_f1": 0.7854, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2222, "rouge1_r": 0.1059, "rouge1_f1": 0.1434, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1358, "rougel_r": 0.0647, "rougel_f1": 0.0876, "bleurt": 0.2992, "bert_score_p": 0.8, "bert_score_r": 0.8026, "bert_score_f1": 0.8013, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4198, "rouge1_r": 0.0854, "rouge1_f1": 0.142, "rouge2_p": 0.05, "rouge2_r": 0.0101, "rouge2_f1": 0.0168, "rougel_p": 0.1975, "rougel_r": 0.0402, "rougel_f1": 0.0668, "bleurt": 0.2759, "bert_score_p": 0.7943, "bert_score_r": 0.8367, "bert_score_f1": 0.8149, "hallucination": 77.77777777777779, "comprehensive": 22.22222222222222}]}

It can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable. Now, when it comes to memory loss, there are different types of memory loss that can occur. One type is called \"episodic memory loss,\" which refers to the inability to recall specific events or experiences. Another type is called \"semantic memory loss,\" which refers to the inability to recall general knowledge or facts.\n\nStep 2/2\nSo, does depression have a relationship with memory loss? The answer is yes, but it's not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Studies have shown that people with depression are more likely to experience memory problems, particularly episodic memory loss. This is because depression can affect the way the brain processes and stores information, leading to difficulties in recalling specific events or experiences. However, it's important to note that memory loss is not a defining feature of depression, and not everyone with depression will experience memory problems. Additionally, memory loss can also be caused by other factors, such as aging, stress, or certain medical conditions. In summary, while depression can be associated with memory loss, it's not the only factor that can contribute to memory problems.

Once you have received your test results, your healthcare provider will be able to determine the best course of treatment for you. This may involve taking antibiotics or other medications to clear up the infection. In some cases, you may also need to be retested after completing treatment to ensure that the infection has been fully cleared.

I was reading a post a couple days ago where someone was looking for remedies to help as they were shy about going to the doctor. I posted a couple different things that were/are working for me. So, I really have no idea if someone reads through the replies and if they see anything useful to them. I could probably go on to tell y'all things I have used. But, there is a simple one that should be cheap and no risk that I would define as \"Simple\" iotre2020 , 5 years ago\nLrtn97 How is healing with the salve is not worth? I'm saw the pictures of the bulges. If salve and warm water cloth plus ice they not help I don't know what help you. Thank you for your post. The saltwater soak for ten minutes, a few times per day saturate a cloth with cool iced saltwater, place it over a pajama \u201cdiaper\u201d in the evening. This helps the healing process tremendously and should be figured into any treatment plan you follow. Synthetic underwear is a hindrance, as it traps moisture in the entire area, it is also a trapdoor for urine and stool to get \u201cstuck\u201d, especially in the anal crevasse, and should be stopped. In folk and native stories, fish have replaced undergarments, and Pai seen it plenty, it is not a dietary conscience issue here.

Soak your anal region for about 20 minutes and then use a tissue to dry it off. Repeat this daily.\n\n2.) Ointments and creams.\nPlain zinc oxide ointment can help to soothe irritable and inflamed skin with deep cracks.\nYou can also use over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream as advised by your physician.\n\n3.) Topical anesthetic cream.\nIf you\u2019re feeling a lot of pain in the area, usually lidocaine 5% is recommended and is available over the counter.\n\n4.) Stool softeners and laxatives.\nYou can use mild stool softeners to help facilitate bowel movements. Some over-the-counter laxatives that you can find:\nLactulose, Senna, MiraLAX, Fleet enema\n\n5.)

If there\u2019s one thing that everyone seems to be very familiar with, that is hemorrhoids. Most people have hemorrhoids at some point in their lives.\n\nConditions related to the rectal area can be a bit embarrassing to talk about. Many people may think of hemorrhoids as small irritations. However, hemorrhoids can be very uncomfortable and if left untreated can get a lot more severe. The exact causes of hemorrhoids may not be known to everyone, but ain\u2019t no need to fret at least now you know what causes hemorrhoids.\n\nFissures and hemmroids are quite common, and we\u2019ll see some medical advice for hemorrhoids here. They are known to be the result of strained bowel movements. Hemorrhoids are common after pregnancy and among the elderly. People under excessive mental and physical stress also develop hemorrhoids.\n\nIt is important to know that hemorrhoids will go away on its own. The length of this process depends on many factors. Do fissures and hemmroids heal on their own? These painful conditions should not be painful at all. This should be a sign that they\u2019re not healing on their own anymore.\n\nSo the answer to the question, \u201cDo fissures and hemmroids heal on their own?\u201d is a big no. It does not pay to ignore these problems because when they further progress, it would be very hard to treat them. It\u2019s important to seek medical advice and if it gets serious, you may go in for an operation to completely remove the disease. But hopefully, hemorrhoids will clear up on its own.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. http://www.hemorrhoidsmayhem.com/article-do-hemorrhoids-heal-on-their-own/", "If you\u2019re asking yourself these questions, you\u2019re not alone. Many women of all ages suffer from anal fissures and hemmroids, and the thought of sitting for hours on end or even just going to the bathroom can be extremely unpleasant. Fortunately, there are a number of steps you can take to help ease the symptoms and prevent them from getting worse. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore what anal fissures and hemmroids are, their causes, symptoms, and treatments. Read on to find out more!\n\n<strong>The Good News:</strong> You can help heal anal fissures and hemmroids on your own without having to go through too much pain or discomfort. But before you do anything else, it\u2019s important to understand what caused them in the first place. All three of these issues are very common, but there are differences between them that determine the best way to address and treat each one.\n\nMainly, anal fissures are a form of injury to the lining of the colon, while hemmroids are actually swollen veins found near the rectum that may or may not hurt. Both of these conditions can be very unpleasant, but luckily they don\u2019t always require invasive medical treatment (though sometimes surgery is needed).\n\n<strong>Anal Fissures:</strong> Anal fissures are most often caused by trauma to the lining of the colon (or rectum). This can occur due to certain lifestyles, such as being overweight/obese and then neglecting your health with poor diet habits. Other times anal fissures can be caused by constipation due to dehydration or caffeine consumption.\n\n<strong>Hemmroids:</strong> Hemmroids are also caused by some type of trauma to the blood vessels in the colon (or rectum) region that result in swelling and pain around that area. The good news is that unlike anal fissures, hemmroids typically do not increase in severity unless they are not treated. Generally, the pain caused due to hemmroids is lower than that caused by the anal fissures. However, the treatment options for anal fissures are also effective in curing hemmroids.\n\n<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Luckily, there are some common symptoms that indicate whether you may have anal fissures or hemorrhoid, and if so, what kind (internal/external). . These can include any one of the following signs:\n\n* Reddened areas around the anus\n* Anal Fissures \u2013 Pinpoint punctures in this area usually cause more pain than regular\n* Painful bowel movements\n* Anal Fissures \u2013 Bleeding after a bowel movement could indicate this"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4522, "rouge1_r": 0.1775, "rouge1_f1": 0.2549, "rouge2_p": 0.0962, "rouge2_r": 0.0376, "rouge2_f1": 0.0541, "rougel_p": 0.2357, "rougel_r": 0.0925, "rougel_f1": 0.1329, "bleurt": 0.3008, "bert_score_p": 0.8264, "bert_score_r": 0.842, "bert_score_f1": 0.8341, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3248, "rouge1_r": 0.1186, "rouge1_f1": 0.1738, "rouge2_p": 0.0192, "rouge2_r": 0.007, "rouge2_f1": 0.0103, "rougel_p": 0.1592, "rougel_r": 0.0581, "rougel_f1": 0.0852, "bleurt": 0.2001, "bert_score_p": 0.7848, "bert_score_r": 0.8068, "bert_score_f1": 0.7957, "hallucination": 81.25, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4013, "rouge1_r": 0.1975, "rouge1_f1": 0.2647, "rouge2_p": 0.0641, "rouge2_r": 0.0314, "rouge2_f1": 0.0422, "rougel_p": 0.1656, "rougel_r": 0.0815, "rougel_f1": 0.1092, "bleurt": 0.2493, "bert_score_p": 0.8094, "bert_score_r": 0.8376, "bert_score_f1": 0.8232, "hallucination": 56.25, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.2803, "rouge1_r": 0.1086, "rouge1_f1": 0.1566, "rouge2_p": 0.0064, "rouge2_r": 0.0025, "rouge2_f1": 0.0036, "rougel_p": 0.121, "rougel_r": 0.0469, "rougel_f1": 0.0676, "bleurt": 0.2075, "bert_score_p": 0.7792, "bert_score_r": 0.7974, "bert_score_f1": 0.7882, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3822, "rouge1_r": 0.2113, "rouge1_f1": 0.2721, "rouge2_p": 0.0705, "rouge2_r": 0.0389, "rouge2_f1": 0.0501, "rougel_p": 0.172, "rougel_r": 0.0951, "rougel_f1": 0.1224, "bleurt": 0.3019, "bert_score_p": 0.8228, "bert_score_r": 0.824, "bert_score_f1": 0.8234, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4713, "rouge1_r": 0.18, "rouge1_f1": 0.2606, "rouge2_p": 0.0705, "rouge2_r": 0.0268, "rouge2_f1": 0.0389, "rougel_p": 0.2102, "rougel_r": 0.0803, "rougel_f1": 0.1162, "bleurt": 0.2521, "bert_score_p": 0.8124, "bert_score_r": 0.8294, "bert_score_f1": 0.8208, "hallucination": 6.25, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

I do drink a pot a day. If you do too, any thoughts on that?\nI get the same. I usually carry Advil Migraine or one of those non-drowsy fast acting antihistamines with me if I'm gonna be out. I don't have any bad effects from caffeine, but since I like to have a cup in the morning (usually buy Fair Trade organic ground from Aldi's which is pretty inexpensive, doesn't taste too bad), I'll usually wind up using that as my alarm clock. Not something I'd recommend to others, though.\nI read a study that there is some medical consensus that caffeine may actually prevent migraines. So if the timing of when you have a cup of coffee is just right, I would continue to drink it.\nReally? That's good to know. I think I'll keep gluggin' 'em.\nI feel your pain......\n\nTension benefits from exercise. What I'm doing is going for 4k yard runs everyday (after 21 days). I feel much better and I think I got out of the tension cycle.\nI also find that increasing exercise helps. I had migraines (1-3/week) until about a year ago when I started gym work outs. Since then I have only had three (total) and with the those only lasted about 30 minutes before going away.\n\nDuring migraines I have found that lighting a match and holding a hand behind the lit match helps some as well. The surprising thing is that they don't go through the whole \"chemicals\" nonsense of the first couple cracks into the match and removing the match is nowhere near what they say are causes.\n\nA chiropractor may also be able to help. You may not need \"full checks\" every week but drops (modify your health insurance coverage for improvements in monthly premiums). Getting you vertebrae back to right may be just as critical as a drug you take. A good chiropractor will help the assumption of correct physiology. A shrimp can shoot 10 feet across water and a K-9 can leap yards; physiology forces something not quite right to correct itself and proper spine manipulation makes this more likely to happen. Don't know what kind of plan is followed for chiropractors but I can tick off (only one) from the Antietam Campaign of", "Up to now I'd have said there is no chance of me getting migraines .

I can't quite pronounce it without tongue twists.

I switched from SPLI to Sundays and they stopped. I am still on splurging every now and then.\n\nI suffer from these too. Horrible ones. I couldn't find a particular correlation between them though and my appetite or amount of eating. GF and LBD have knocked most of the wine from my diet too but wine is a very big trigger for me with migraines and this has brought me on to eat and drink much more for a long time than I would have wanted to because I was enjoying it.

Thank very very much.\n\nIn my 25+ years of dealing with chronic migraines, I have modified my diet a significant. I believe my migraines are largely a food intolerance issues. I notice several of your listed foods also cause me pain. I take steps to avoid these foods; olive oil, metal utensil use, gelatin, nut oils and nuts, corn ect. I find time to diffuse grounded emulsified epsom salt to aid in detoxing through the stretching muscles. I use herbs like lemon balm, thyme and peppermint (teas and add to food creations), and white willow bark. I drink lots of water, coconut water, infused home made herbal tisanes. I notice my pain in connection with mercury and I just learned the FDA is allows 60 millligrams (18 times the Isolated exposure) with out and antigen. I follow allot of natural health advocates and doctors advocates that things like this are in my opinion, an attack on our health. This does not have to be a way of life. We can stop taking it to the extreme. Our bodies naturally metabolize and full of chemical components we (west) are made up completely of. There are many elements made in the body (ie: sodium, potassium, calcium, sodium, iron, magnesium ect) these things are being stripped away in our water, food and skin care products. Please read on WaterFindingDub.com their work has won scientific awards by the EPA and other agencies. We can recover from this ugly part of the world. I use lime, lemon, and horticultural lime because it is made from dead sea shells which are treated (killed) by the lime processing.\n\nHow does eating fermented foods like dairy and kimchi helps prevents EVAPORATION OF INDIVIDUALS! Also the \"foodie\" opinions I read on omega 3 oil like hemp are filled with mistaken and myth as well!\n\nI avoided eating food that could induce migraines for years and eventually started adding olives and rotating where I kept my exercise routine and started seeing real improvements to my migraine frequency.

Next doctor gave me 50 mg of generic Zomig... stopped migraines and I could move around better. Soon they started returning even with 50 mg and I began 100 mg-- it always works if I take them in the beginning stage, but this is a little later than I should, but then, sometimes the pain is so severe I have to wait till I can get my hands to the pill. Another frightening side effect is that sometimes after vomiting, my ears pop right away and I feel so dizzy and \"lost\" that I cannot walk or talk for at least 10 minutes.\n\nI went on Rogaine foam about 20 years ago.

I've never taken mirtazapine and I've taken Synthroid regularly about once a week for the last couple of years.\n5) Unfortunately, I cannot make any suggestions.\n\nI think that the answer is in the type of \"tiredness.\" There are different types of tiredness. Unfortunately, neither you nor I know what type of tiredness you're feeling. So if you could describe it in more detail, that could help a bit. However, a question needs to be answered in the above list. The other things that you've said that could be causing the tiredness don't make sense.\n\nHas this \"tiredness\" issue shown up with you for the last few weeks? Or is it a new thing lately?\n\nBuspar is in the benzo family, so like a benzo, it usually does make me tired when I take it. It clears up in a day or two, though. Good luck and I hope it finally catches up with your stress and helps you to sleep at night.\n\nI was taking Buspirone in the mornings before taking antidepressants; I was anxious all the time and doctors would suggest antidepressants, but I turned it down because I have horrible chemical reactions to them. So basically my sleep was very bad, all night was a battle to drift off then if I had no nightmares something", "I have trouble falling a sleep. I was taking MPH 3 times a day up until a month ago and woke instantly after taken. I have nothing to become worried for when taking the meds. Now that I have taken away the MPH am now falling sleep within 15 to 20 mins after sleeping! anxiety is overwhelming\n\nI used Amphetamines for around 5 years now after a diagnosis. They increased my depression, loss of appetite, anxiety and emotional issues, i felt dead inside. That is until my new Psychologist told me to try Buspar. Ive been taking it for 2 weeks now and i honestly can't believe the difference. I don't feel depressed at all, i feel great. My appetite and energy have dramatically increased, i don't have eating disorders of any form, sleeping is fantastic i feel like a whole lot more of me is back! It's zero euphoria and no euphoria cravings,(uphoria) which is what i was struggling with the most but with the the side effect of these pillies it's common. I'm so over the medication process hating these pills or any pill but it really does take some of the edge off after a shocker in 2013 buspar has turned so many thoughts darker into something normal, it's gradually improving my thinking and medically it is apart of my problem with being told to have even stronger uphiogenic medication when i feel definately my antidepressants and buspar work better together. Once again i've felt in the past uphmbia based antidepressants have only made me high with remissive symptoms of depression, anxiety and sleep problems! wow though, buspar has worked wonders no euphoria desired no hangovers no too fast heart rates still no unfavourable levels of dopamine! #suicidepages4stoopiduphia ... it's working for me!Read More Read Less\n\nI have been on various antidepressants. I now use Buspar 15mg for anxiety and it works well. I sleep well. Have energy. I am active. My mood is stable. And the benefits are best for me when I start my dose in the middle of the night.\n\nI am always thinking of solution to my problems. Others like me find comfort in going to church but for me I am ending up tormenting myself. I always tell myself, things can't get better......and then I am searching for the answers.

This puts the lungs at risk for failure.\n\nPeople should also be aware of their possible risk factors, such as a weakened immune system and chronic illness.\n\nHow often does bronchitis lead to pneumonia?\n\nAccording to theThe Joint Commission, pneumonia occurs much more frequently in the older community than in children, usually triggered by infections bacteria.\n\nolder people, but also people with certain lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, or COPD, are more likely to develop bacterial pneumonia.\n\nChildren may get bronchitis around three times per year in their first 2 years of life, and five to seven times a year until the age of 12.\n\nFortunately, this condition subsides as other lung-damaging conditions occur, according to the American College of Chest Physicians.\n\nIn chronic cases, declining lung function is the main cause of complications as a result of inflammation of the larynx or airways.\n\nOutlook\n\nBronchitis is not a life threatening condition in and of itself. However, it does increase a person\u2019s risk for developing pneumonia if left untreated.\n\nAvoiding viruses and infections and treating infections promptly can help to prevent the harm caused by bronchitis.

You can easily contract the infection by having frequent contact with a person who has herpes.\n\n<strong>The virus spreads through skin-to-skin contact to can cause the following:</strong>\n\n* Symptoms include herpes sores and blisters, which can be extremely painful and itch.\n* Genital herpes also causes inflammation and genital irritation.\n\nBasically, anyone can get herpes. Therefore, children who are infected with herpes may develop a condition that is called neonatal herpes.\n\nNeonatal herpes can be serious and may lead to infant death. If herpes is not managed properly, it may spread rapidly and cause fatal herpes infections throughout the body.\n\nThe condition is somewhat rare. It mostly affects babies who acquire the infection in the womb before birth, or babies who are born to a woman who is infected with herpes.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by either of the two types of the herpes simplex virus: type 1 or type 2.\n\nThis survey of sexuality education among adolescents in Pakistan through a cross-sectional study showed that teen vaginal herpes appears for about 3.8% of teen women in the United States.\n\nUsually, herpes type 2 is typically linked to genital affection.

This might make them wonder, \u201cDoes herpes come out of the anus?\u201d The answer is no, but the symptoms you may feel are not uncommon.\n\nDifferent herpesgenital types of herpes don\u2019t produce rectal discharges, so don\u2019t worry. Yet, there\u2019re some people who may feel symptoms similar to those caused by a vaginal discharge.\n\nLearn more about genital herpes symptoms and a potential cause of anal itching in this article.\n\nBeyond symptoms\n\nIt\u2019s vital to note that an anus is a part of the female and male reproduction system. What you may feel, especially if you\u2019re a man, is actually a result of close proximity to the genital doorgate. Men have genitalia right next to back a*se, and their a*seses are close to the vagina of a woman.\n\nThis factor keeps anus and ubold so close that during oral a*sex, men are most likely to be in physical contact with both, and while engaging in similar activities with their female partner, women are most likely to experience the same.\n\nJust like the rectum, anus does not produce discharge. Back a*ses do not produce discharge, let alone sperm. This odd sensation with a similarity to discharge may be reciprocal, meaning you may feel the same symptoms or your partner may feel the same symptoms. These symptoms are caused by altered, itchy, or irritated ubold usings.\n\nCauses\n\nAnal itching can have several causes. When combined with burning, stinging, or tingling sensations, genital herpes rash, you might attribute the concerns to an infection or STI.\n\nSometimes, HSV can be at fault. HSV can survive and persist even within the anus. So yes, it\u2019s possible to spread herpes through this body factor. This is the reason why it\u2019s imperative to be with absolute truth during the time of an outbreak.\n\nThis burning, stinging, or tingling feeling may be accompanied by urine discharge if itchy sweather is the cause of the problem.\n\nThe symptoms may increase if too much sweat gets in touch with the anus. It\u2019s not the natural dry ubold that feels like this. However, there are few other causes that may trigger a similar concern.\n\nA few possible causes of physical discomfort in men and women are:", "Rectal and anal herpes cannot be transmitted through semen or vaginal fluids, as those fluid only carry genital herpes.\n\nIf a person with herpes sexually transmits it to their partner, and then they discharge semen or vaginal fluids into their partner\u2019s anus, it cannot transmit the virus.\n\nHowever, bleeding sores caused by the virus in the genital area, the passage of feces, or sex can cause herpes to move from the openings near the anus into the anal and rectal area.\n\nThis means it can produce blisters in the regions and cause inflammation and get discharged like an \u201canal drip.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to contract herpes from another person through anal sex, although this is less likely than contracting it through oral or vaginal sex.\n\nLearn more about how you can get herpes here.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe affects of herpes often begin in the groin area. However, certain viruses can spread through the rectum and anus and cause a rash or blisters, or somatic disorders.\n\nSome symptoms can include:\n\n* anus pain\n* pain on the anus with bowel movements\n* bleeding sores on the anus (thrombosed hemorrhoids)\n* rash\n* itching\n\nTreat Somatic Disorders\n\nMany of these symptoms do not relate directly to typical anal herpes symptoms.

To self-diagnose adequately, it\u2019s best to visit a doctor for their diagnosis and advice. Many conditions improve with nutritional changes and routine treatment of underlying conditions. Once the examiner has a diagnosis, often a few treatments can resolve the problem.\n\nTreatments for conditions that cause anal and rectal symptoms:\n\n* abscesses and anal fistulas, but also dermatitis, piles, rectal prolapse, fissures, and others, respond well to <i>epigastrium</i> care, iodine spray, calamine lotion, and antibiotic creams.\n* other coagulopathies may respond better to oral and injection antibiotics.\n* localized rectal bleeding can be treated with a bedpan and a water rinser.\n\nHow to prevent recurrence\n\nMost herpes cases are caused by herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1).", "Usually, herpes simplex virus infection is a genital lesion, a so-called virus of love.

However, there is only one type of HSV-1. HSV 2 is the type of herpes that encompasses a lot and it is quite aggressive, the hereditary infectious disease. If you are infected with this type of herpes, both feet are bad. This means that these spores have affection for lower limbs especially.\n\n \n\nTherefore, there is a very good possibility that the outbreak you feel on the thighs or that is spreading through the inside leg is herpes.

It produces hormones that regulate metabolism, which is the process of converting food into energy.\n\nThe thyroid gland also produces hormones that regulate the body\u2019s temperature and heart rate.\n\nThe thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland produces a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones.\n\nWhen the thyroid gland is not producing enough hormones, it is called hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, among other symptoms.\n\nThe thyroid gland is also controlled by the hypothalamus, which is located in the brain. The hypothalamus produces a hormone called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce TSH.\n\nWhen the thyroid gland is not producing enough hormones, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland will produce more TRH and TSH, respectively, in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones.\n\nThis process is called the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.\n\nThe thyroid gland is also controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the body\u2019s involuntary functions, such as heart rate and digestion.\n\nThe autonomic nervous system has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. When the body is in a state of stress, the sympathetic nervous system is activated. This causes the body to release hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can cause weight gain.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \u201crest and digest\u201d response. When the body is in a state of relaxation, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated. This causes the body to release hormones, such as oxytocin and serotonin, which can cause weight loss.\n\nThe thyroid gland is also controlled by the immune system. The immune system is responsible for protecting the body from infection and disease.\n\nWhen the immune system is not functioning properly, it can cause weight gain.\n\nThe thyroid gland is also controlled by the endocrine system.

These are questions I frequently get from my patients.\n\nThe purpose of thyroid hormone in the body is to increase its ability to produce energy. When the thyroid gland underneath the neck does not produce enough hormone, a person becomes very lethargic, has low energy and finds it more difficult to lose weight or to maintain a desirable weight. An inadequate level of thyroid may also cause heart disease by increasing the blood cholesterol known as LDL and a slowing of the heart's beating rhythm. Patients with low thyroid are often emotionally flat and say they couldn't care less about their disease or their weight.\n\nBut weight gain tops their list of concerns and impediments to how they feel.\n\nHowever, when a patient is started on thyroid hormone and their thyroid levels are elevated to the normal range, their body functions are back to normal. This includes also the fat released into the bloodstream to be burned by the body. At the same time, there is often a gratifying and thankful loss of weight.\n\nSo for those concerned that thyroid medicines cause a patient to gain weight, this is not a problem since reversing an underactive thyroid often means weight loss.\n\nTo learn more about how thyroid medications work, read here: How Thyroid Medications Change Your Energy Level.", "Thyroid issues affect your metabolism just like insulin issues affect your sugar cravings.

Researchers have conclusively linked low thyroid production to weight gain and inability to lose weight.\n\nThe thyroid goes beyond just metabolizing calories, however. Scientists now agree that the thyroid can help regulate everything from heart function to neurological function, immune function, even your fertility and your libido. Taking an in-depth look at the thyroid and circadian energy and hormones can help explain why and how these systems work.\n\nDifferent hormones impact many types of organ function, but the one hormone closely connected to the thyroid is thyroxine (or T3). Perhaps this is why the weight-loss specialist found in patients with low thyroid is not centered around the thyroid-only problem. This is why it can be helpful to consider how hormone and thyroid issues can impact you and your life. \n\nThe positive point to remember here is that starting to address your low T3 hormone problems immediately can start to help the symptoms of both low thyroid and low levels of metabolic activity \u2013 because once your thyroid starts to work again, you\u2019ll be better able to burn fat, and you\u2019re likely to feel more energized too.\n\n<h2><b>What is Thyroid Disease?</b></h2>\n\nThe thyroid is a tiny gland situated in your throat, just above your breastbone. The low thyroid doctor initially suspected that the hormone thyroxine from the thyroid assisted with BMI by helping the body burn fat by metabolizing sugars. However, this now appears to be incorrect and has been referred to as a \u2018Big Misconception.\u2019\n\nResearch now suggests that your thyroid mainly regulates metabolism by influencing the speed at which your cells burn calories. Several mechanisms contribute to this process of burning fat, but the most significant way the thyroid burns calories is to turn off any unnecessary or excess cells in your body that can not be used in the future.\n\nThis phenomenon is called cell turnover \u2013 where the body renews cells at a desired rate and only creates new cells for vital bodily functions. For example, it has been suggested that people with low thyroid are targeted by cancer-causing viruses because their body is not producing enough T3 to keep those cells from renewing and turning TB away from killing them as usual.\n\nAlthough the connection is supported by much evidence, there is still a great deal of dispute surrounding exactly why low thyroid impacts weight loss so much. \n\nShould low thyroid levels be correlated with obesity? Low thyroid can be caused by a low immune system, poor nutrition, poor sleep patterns", "A sharp-crested triangular weir with a notch angle of $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is used to measure the discharge rate of water from a large lake into a spillway.

My A1C dropped from 8.7 to 6.2 and my Dr. said that I was the first patient he had to ever get his fasting blood glucose below 100 on Metformin, and to the second patient to require anything more than metformin. The weight gain sucked however, and led to ejection from the study. Unfortunately all my other meds were poisoned by the grapefruit crush that I did after I got kicked out of the study, therefore I now spend the rest of my life dealing with a painful foot condition know as Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome, because the Doctor that never should have licensed her medical license barraged me with Lupron and other things, but ever since I was stable again, I haven't had a continually dropping baseline blood glucose, because living with TTS and the constant pain from CNS interfere with sleep, which impacts my HPA axis, which in turn impacts my Endocrinological axis, which in turn means my Endocrinologist who left her tears wherever she trusted patients is fucking the ball.

Serendipitous genetic studies found that introduction and expression of SLA1, a fatty acid synthase modulator gene on an Ish/IshS transposon in MRSA, resulted in loss of the octadecanoic medium-chain fatty acid and removal of the requirement for the vancomycin-induced, resistance gene VdAB. This pythiastatin-induced vancomycin resistance can be counteracted in vitro by liquid carbon sources in which vancomycin fails to affect MRSA growth even at vancomycin levels of 4,000 \u03bcg/mL.

If that doesn't work then you just need to pump it off sooner.\n\nDisclaimer: I all the time don't understand all the details within my estimate.

We had wanted to go back home after work on a Friday but something odd happened. The crew left for San Francisco and we walked home. As I was putting away my suitcase and swinging the door open, my home guard guys showed up. They asked me if I was turning my watch upside down, because my neighbour had just turned over his watch.

This term was coined by Ann M. Benson in the mid-1980s and is derived from the idea of passive aggression that was originally described in the world of psychology.

I painted with joy today and my biggest delight was what came out of my pallet as far as colors when randomly blending paints for a background. \n\nI had been painting every day for as long as I could remember. It started back when I was 13. I still had my Freehold NJ shop back then and this was my first true hop at business. I called the shop \u201cThe Young Artists Gallery\u201d because I was 13, the guy who painted the sign was in his 30s and he had a lot of time pulling all nighters painting letters. Unfortunately, the letters ended up smaller than expected so the entire place was smaller than the sign. Because of this, I had something like plays and concerts in the space. And maybe even comedy shows. I remember the band Sheepworld played one time. They were a delightful one-hit wonder who had a minor local pop hit out about unwanted daycare. \n\nThe Young Artists Gallery was a place where children were brought to learn painting and art in general. The place transformed the lives of many people including Dan Schreck. After a summer of working for me at 15 painting and cleaning up after the skyrocketing business during those hot months of 1974, Dan said he was seeking to create an organization to help dropouts find high school teaching jobs and placing them in schools. I had been delaying joining the army because I had to pass the test and take the physical examination. I told him I\u2019ll do it if he could get me in a school. He told me to email him. I had no idea and he had no idea what an email was. When I graduated high school and was inducted in the Navy, I went to a Russian-teaming school. Worst experience in my life.

And for once, it\u2019s not my husband or kids\u2019 fault. I\u2019m usually racing to try to do something for someone else, but for once, no one expects anything of me.\n\nI feel like a burden to my family to be sick on top of complicated holiday preparations. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m ungrateful. I adore them dearly and know how fortunate I am, and my Christmas is full of things that ground me in the things that matter in life. But when I try for it to be <em>red-letter-day</em> happy and I\u2019m sitting in the dark counting my fists to stop my teeth from chattering, something just doesn\u2019t smell right every time my nose picks the sour juices of the grime of a full social calendar.\n\nNada makes me happy these days. Like nothing. Not even being with my loved ones. It\u2019s just me, my weird vibes (if you\u2019ve been going to one of my gigs, you\u2019ve felt this weird vibe, I\u2019m afraid!), and everything from viral nausea: cough, congestion, chills, and sweating and other unpleasantness.

I want them happy and joyful and not puking their guts out and facing Christmas with a quash and running nose and a pair of dead eyes.\n\nSuch a different Christmas this year because I\u2019m not skating on the scamming and cheating vibe of co-dependency born of abuse.

The cuff is placed around the upper arm and inflated to a pressure that is higher than the systolic blood pressure. The pressure is then slowly released, and the stethoscope is used to listen for the sounds of the blood flowing through the arteries. The systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure that is measured, and the diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure that is measured.\n\nWhat is the normal range for blood pressure?\n\nThe normal range for blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60 and 120/80 mmHg. However, it is important to note that blood pressure can vary throughout the day and can be affected by factors such as age, gender, and physical activity. It is recommended that individuals have their blood pressure checked regularly to ensure that it remains within a healthy range.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is often referred to as the \"silent killer\" because it often has no symptoms. However, some people may experience symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. It is important to have your blood pressure checked regularly to ensure that it remains within a healthy range.\n\nWhat are the causes of high blood pressure?\n\nThere are many factors that can contribute to high blood pressure, including age, family history, diet, and lifestyle. Some of the most common causes of high blood pressure include obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and a sedentary lifestyle. It is important to make healthy lifestyle choices and to consult with a healthcare professional if you are concerned about your blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the risks of high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure can increase the risk of developing serious health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.

Medications may also be prescribed to help lower blood pressure. It is important to work with a healthcare professional to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs.\n\nWhat are the complications of high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure can lead to a number of serious health complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease", "As an initial step, sit with your feet flat on the floor and get a feel for the blood pressure cuff and the cuff positioning. The cuff should be positioned a few inches above the bend in your upper arm. Your arm should be supported (as in the image below) to reduce sudden movement that would affect the blood pressure reading.\n\nGet your patient ready for systolic blood pressure (SBP):\n\n* Use a clean, dry, short sleeve shirt\n* Seat patient in a chair with the feet flat on the floor\n\nCheck patient and note:\n\n* Age\n* Gender\n* Smoker or nonsmoker\n* Mood (opt for a patient who is in good mood and not grumpy or irritable)\n* Have a watch on and be ready to take your pulse\n\nThe first value you will get is the patient\u2019s pulse. Get reflective and figure out the pulse location indicated in the image below.\n\nAs indicated in the image, place two fingers (middle and index fingers) on the radial pulse. Denote the patient\u2019s pulse (in beats per minute) using your watch.\n\nThe second value you will get is the patient\u2019s SBP. Take this value using your arm cuff (an inflatable pressure cuff).\n\nBefore doing this, please make sure you have the proper cuff for the patient\u2019s wrist. When stacking the brochures above for own use of the cuff, space out the brochures equally to three sections. All patient\u2019s can use this table for measurement:\n\nNow inflating the cuff is simple: you will want to make sure that the valve to the metal hose is closed before inflating the cuff. Use the pump to control the flow of air to the cuff.\n\nWatch image for illustration.\n\nTest the type of apical sounds associated with different apical rates in the image below:\n\nYou will be liking making a movement from point 2 to point 1. As model apical rate increases, so does the audible sound (moment of mercury spill). The faint sounds are 75-100 beats per minute. You may advance practice clinical by asking the patient to increase your heart rate (to see how it sounds).\n\nThis is why movement from point 2 to point 1 matters. Suddenly moving from point 2 to point 1 will cause you to miss the sound of the point 1 reading. Take your time with this and make sure you mark apical rate and provide the correct sound below.\n\nMeasure the patient\u2019s diastolic blood pressure. This task will complement the", "It should be noted that the mercury column method is the best method (with the accuracy of 3 mmHg or less). I will first describe this method briefly and then, in the following paragraphs, describe some of the modern apparatus such as the iris sensor, directly attached blood pressure monitor (upper arm cuff), sphygmomanometer (with direct, analog or digital measurements), that are also available nowadays (mostly digital) which are very practical and useful .......", "You should use the sphygmomanometer as per the instructions that came with it. A few basic guidelines are:\n\n* Find the right place to wrap the cuff around your upper arm\n* The cuff should be wrapped exactly the same way each time\n* Locate the brachial artery pulse using your other hand by placing one finger over it\n* Always place the stethoscope tubing the same way at the top and just before locking it\n* Hold the stethoscope behind your neck and press it down with your chin\n* While still wearing it, lock the stethoscope tube\n* As the cuff inflates, listen for transmitted taps with the stethoscope\n* Start off at about 100mm Hg and work up in 5mm Hg steps\n* You\u2019ll stop hearing the taps in the stethoscope when the cuff is inflated to a level equal to the systolic blood pressure reading Number to read\n* Measure the patient\u2019s radial following recoup while they are wearing the cuff when the stethoscope is totally blocked number to increase the blood pressure\n* Inflate the cuff to this amount and then immediately unplug it. Oscillations should begin to occur. Look for the border at which vibrations were completely eliminated\n\n<h2>How do I take my blood pressure manually?</h2>\n\nFollowing are the steps to take blood pressure manually:\n\n* Find the correct cuff position: Wear the cuff around your upper arm. To avoid touching the bicep muscle, it must be at least 15cm away from the elbow joint. As you raise your arm, the cuff and arm should be on the same level.\n* The cuff should be properly fastened: You\u2019ll need to wrap the cuff around your arms and secure it with the plastic tube. Everything should fit in your arm if it\u2019s too tight, feel free to undo it and wear it again.\n* Change the position of your arm: You\u2019ll need to extend your arm while raising it for your chest to be level. Try to avoid bending the elbow and place your arm flat against the bench.\n* After wrapping your arm around your cuffs, locate the brachial heart pulse and place a stethoscope over it.\n* Make an initial decision on the cutting pressure: As the cuff begins to inflate, the initial sound transmitted will be heard. Turn to a volume that is suitable for you as soon as this sound is recorded. The following step is to listen carefully to the cadence as the pressure rises until you hear the first rhythmic thump. The cutting point is the pressure level when you next see the sound", "Pulse is indicated to the nurse as 80 beats per minute (bpm) and 120 of systolic and 80 of diastolic <math display=\"inline\"><mfrac xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">mm</mi> <mi mathvariant=\"italic\">Hg</mi> </mfrac></math>. What is the pulse wave velocity?", "To measure your blood pressure, we use a special instrument known as a sphygmomanometer. It contains a cuff that has air-filled bladder and a pressure gauge.\n\nWe inflate the bladder and slowly release air to record a series of rhythmic high and low pressure signals. The high pressure signal is called systolic pressure. It is the highest pressure in the blood vessel during each heartbeat.\n\nThe low pressure signal is called diastolic pressure. The diastolic number is always lower than the systolic number.\n\nWhenever the systolic and diastolic pressures are equal, air in the bladder is emptied and the cuff falls off of your arm or it can go around your patients\u2019 waist. When it falls off, it releases compressed blood to flow unimpeded, causing you to hear the systolic pressure values. They are written as a ration. For example, 130 over 80 or 130/80.\n\nSo how should I choose a cutoffe cuff or an arm cuff for measuring blood pressure? Which DO I choose and why?\n\nWell, you need to choose an arm cuff if you are measuring blood pressure on a patient who is lying on a bed, because you want to make sure when you get their blood pressure reading it is accurate.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to have any external interference whenever you are measuring their blood pressure.\n\nIf you are measuring blood pressure on a patient on the waist, you have to simply choose a cuff, because you must have the space around the waist that you can wrap the tube around. If you are measuring a child\u2019s blood pressure, no matter what the age, it is still important to measure on the arm since children cannot control their breath. Usually, measuring the blood pressure on the waist lowers the blood pressure, influencing inaccurately the results.\n\nYou need to choose a wide girth cuff to place when measuring the children, because this one allows the widest range of inflation and measuring blood pressure.\n\nFinally, if you want to deflate the cuff faster you need to choose a large diameter tube, because they are frictionless in operation and they will deflate faster than the thinner tube.\n\nSo even professionals can ask are the cuff tales better than the blood pressure machine.\n\nIf you ask about a cuff, that\u2019s easy to answer: It is the best thing that can help you not only take your blood pressure but also that of your family, whether they are babies to adults.\n\nJust choose it and learn how to measure your blood pressure, you can enjoy a"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4186, "rouge1_r": 0.25, "rouge1_f1": 0.313, "rouge2_p": 0.1245, "rouge2_r": 0.0742, "rouge2_f1": 0.093, "rougel_p": 0.2287, "rougel_r": 0.1366, "rougel_f1": 0.171, "bleurt": 0.3455, "bert_score_p": 0.8298, "bert_score_r": 0.8358, "bert_score_f1": 0.8328, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5039, "rouge1_r": 0.314, "rouge1_f1": 0.3869, "rouge2_p": 0.1089, "rouge2_r": 0.0678, "rouge2_f1": 0.0836, "rougel_p": 0.1977, "rougel_r": 0.1232, "rougel_f1": 0.1518, "bleurt": 0.2663, "bert_score_p": 0.8143, "bert_score_r": 0.8388, "bert_score_f1": 0.8264, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.1163, "rouge1_r": 0.411, "rouge1_f1": 0.1813, "rouge2_p": 0.0272, "rouge2_r": 0.0972, "rouge2_f1": 0.0426, "rougel_p": 0.0659, "rougel_r": 0.2329, "rougel_f1": 0.1027, "bleurt": 0.2616, "bert_score_p": 0.8218, "bert_score_r": 0.8071, "bert_score_f1": 0.8144, "hallucination": 85.71428571428571, "comprehensive": 16.666666666666664}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5039, "rouge1_r": 0.3052, "rouge1_f1": 0.3801, "rouge2_p": 0.1167, "rouge2_r": 0.0706, "rouge2_f1": 0.088, "rougel_p": 0.2054, "rougel_r": 0.1244, "rougel_f1": 0.155, "bleurt": 0.2944, "bert_score_p": 0.8114, "bert_score_r": 0.8373, "bert_score_f1": 0.8242, "hallucination": 64.28571428571429, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.0465, "rouge1_r": 0.24, "rouge1_f1": 0.0779, "rouge2_p": 0.0039, "rouge2_r": 0.0204, "rouge2_f1": 0.0065, "rougel_p": 0.0349, "rougel_r": 0.18, "rougel_f1": 0.0584, "bleurt": 0.2068, "bert_score_p": 0.7592, "bert_score_r": 0.7789, "bert_score_f1": 0.7689, "hallucination": 92.85714285714286, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4729, "rouge1_r": 0.2831, "rouge1_f1": 0.3541, "rouge2_p": 0.1167, "rouge2_r": 0.0698, "rouge2_f1": 0.0873, "rougel_p": 0.2171, "rougel_r": 0.1299, "rougel_f1": 0.1626, "bleurt": 0.3001, "bert_score_p": 0.8291, "bert_score_r": 0.8359, "bert_score_f1": 0.8325, "hallucination": 64.28571428571429, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}]}

This is a highly disagreeable condition of the year because of the rapid transmission of heat in Singapore\u2019s weather that causes rapid growth of the bacteria and fungi found in the ear canal thereby resulting in the pain in one or both the ears and discharge of a foul smelling fluid from the ears. Thus, it is imperative that swimmers take precautions to prevent experiencing this form of otitis externa or swimmer\u2019s ear.\n\nAs prevention is better than cure, here are a few tips we give to our patients on avoiding swimmer\u2019s ear.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t swim if you have middle ear infection: Although this goes without saying it is very convenient to just \u2018pop\u2019 into the pool on a hot day and accidentally becoming sick.\n\n\u2022 Do wear earplugs: If you have used swimming earplugs in the past or you are acquiring a pair of earplugs just decide on the one that fits your ears best. Fit the tips of the earplug and use as much as the pool or ocean. Don\u2019t leave any part of your ear submerged as it causes water to get in and cause swimmer\u2019s ear.\n\n\u2022 Swimmers oil the ear before swimming: This is another preventative measure you can take to prevent swimmer\u2019s ear which is to either use or purchase ear drops containing alcohol with camphor or oil made using sulphur, camphor or mineral oil. In case you feel any discomfort in the ear(s) while swimming then exit the pool immediately.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t expose your body to unhygienic water: Try to swim in clean water or pool. Don\u2019t swim in the contaminated water such as seawater or any water contaminated with microorganisms especially if you have permeable wax.\nIn addition to this, do remember these further preventive measures.\n\u2022 Avoid swimming immediately after a middle ear infection\n\u2022 Implement a proper hair washing practice before swimming\n\u2022 Do not wax ears regularly as this provides a way for bacteria to enter\n\u2022 Resolve proper drainage after swimming to help prevent infection\n\u2022 Avoid using cotton swabs in the ear canal as these can irritate the inward parts of the ear canal\n\u2022 Dry up the ears before the onset of chills and get timely and affordable consultations with the best ENT surgeon in Singapore.", "A hydrochloric acid solution will neutralize a sodium hydroxide solution.

(b) If A is an $n \\times n$ matrix, show that $A-A^{T}$ is skew-symmetric.", "Because this infection so often occurs after swimming, the first line of defense is actually excellent personal hygiene.\n\nClean your ears after every swim session by <em>gently</em> drying with a soft towel. Try to keep water out around your ears as much as possible. If you go to a pool, be careful not to let water go down your drain. Avoid the temptation to stick cotton swabs (q-tips) into your ear as they can push bacteria further in.\n\nA warm Epsom salt bath can be beneficial and even reduce the swelling of corns, callouses and inflammations. It\u2019s easy to prepare; just add 3/4 cup of Epsom salt to one cup of water. Pour it into your bath and soak for about 20 minutes.\n\nAcupressure normally gives relief from the symptoms of Otitis Externa like pain, discomfort, and inflammation. To try it for yourself, take a firm and comfortable grip on your earlobe and gently pull it toward the rear of the head. Repeat this exercise three times each session at six-hour intervals.\n\nIf you need immediate relief, then you should do ice massage because pain is one of the most common symptoms of Otitis Externa and by applying an ice massage, the pain will be significantly reduced to an enormous extent. Use an ice pack and wrap it with a thick towel as it may be warm. Apply the ice pack for about 5 to 10 min per ear; 2-3 times per day.\n\nHow do you prevent these problems from recurring?\n\nThe answer depends on the specific underlying cause.\n\nIf your ear canal is narrow compared with other people\u2019s, then it may take longer after swimming to dry out. In this case, consider using an eardropper (insert several drops of alcohol <u>after</u> you finish swimming to speed up the drying process). Beware that water and wax can clog the narrow channel, so you\u2019ll need follow up in the event of recurrent symptoms or recurrence.\n\nIf you have a lot of water in your ear canal after swimming, you might need ear tubes. Especially if lots of water is entering the ear drum specifically because of Eustachian tubal dysfunction.\n\nEardroppers with a small volume of steroid medicines and antibiotic for acute swimmer\u2019s ear dryness can also help. They\u2019re especially recommended if you\u2019re experiencing an inflammatory type of swimmer\u2019s ear.\n\nAural drops should be the initial choice for a single episode of the discomfort. Cor", "Otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, is caused by a build-up of moisture in the ear canal. This environment makes it easier for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria to form, which thrives in warm and non-exposed environments.\n\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\n\nSomething other that MRSA that turns otitis externa into a more severe infection is fungal or yeast growth; which is the most common variety.\n\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n\nItchy ear\nGreen, brown, yellow discharge\nSore/painful ear\nThe feeling that an object is in your ear or you can\u2019t hear correctly\nRedness of the ear canal\n\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n\nHome treatment\n\nIf your otitis externa is mild, you may be able to treat the pain and irritation at home. You can do this by:\n\ninserting an ear wick/drum drain with wax formulating agent (not cotton)\ncleaning your ears frequently to help flush the dirt and damaged wax from them\nuse of a dry-it to circulate warm \u201cair\u201d around in the ear canal\navoiding submerging your head\n\nSurgery\n\nIf ear infections become chronic, you should book an appointment with a professional. They may recommend one of the following surgical procedures that can be performed depending on the gravity of your symptoms:\nA myringotomy the doctor will make an incision in your eardrum, using a narrow tube to pressure your ear and thus assisting your pressure.\nA mastoidectomy expands and replaces ear canal tissue to prevent future infections, inhibits and minimizes the risk of deafness.\n\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\n\nIf you're like many swimmers, you probably are meticulous about cleaning your ears after you swim to prevent ear infections. But, as the Chicago Tribune recently reported, you may not be cleaning your ears correctly after moving out of the water and into the locker room -- which could contribute to swimmer's ear.\n\n* After swimming, everything snug in the water should be removed from your ears.\n* Soak your hair and ears with a hairdryer.\n* For 2-3 days, use a solution of 30-70% vinegar mixed with equal parts warm water.\n* Use acetic acid, rose water for care for the ear a few days a week.\n* Let the solution or solution dry in your inside.\n\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n\nWarren Harrop.

The lovely and one of the KEELY WOERTSINGER and my guest Ralph Jones from Active Lynnwood is talking about what is ketosis and how can I do proper keto. \n\nNow on the weight loss podcast we will be talking about Saxenda as opposed to Ozempic. Saxenda the pen-type weight loss injection for weight loss has been used successfully by thousands of people. Saxenda is approved by the FDA for long-term weight management for adults who are overweight or obese and who have at least one weight-related condition including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes or high cholesterol. And the bad news is that in order for you to qualify for Saxenda you have to meet at least one weight-related condition.\n\nSo Saxenda is intended to be given to people with at least one weight-related disease or condition, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. So here\u2019s the question of the day. Can you qualify for Saxenda? \n\nThis is so important and it\u2019s not just for personal accountability because today you really want to put our best foot forward with our health, and make sure that we\u2019re doing everything we can to get better. What is the main food that could really do that? What is the food that is the best to lose weight? What is the food that has the most energy that can keep your brain going all day long? \n\nWe\u2019re talking about <b>Ketosis</b>! On our last month podcast we talked about a supplement called Ozempic. We\u2019re going to talk about ketosis \u2013 of course the simple and easy way to get there is <b>Ozempic.</b> So, what is ketosis?\n\n<h2>What is Ketosis? </h2>\n\nKetosis is a metabolic condition that allows you to burn fat as fuel. In this state, your body turns to fat for energy. During the ketosis process, certain organic molecules called ketones are produced out of fatty acids by the liver. These ketones are then used by the body\u2019s other tissues for energy. Ketosis is the metabolic state in which there is excess amounts of unutilized fatty acids in the body. Once the body transitions to using fat for energy, then the other tissues (like the brain) are having many benefits by using ketones as fuel.\n\n<h3>How can I do Keto?</h3>\n\nAll", "Saxenda is the first and only FDA-approved injection for adults with obesity (BMI of 30kg/m2) or overweight (BMI between 27kg/m2 and 30kg/m2) with a weight related comorbidity that results in meaningful weight loss. Ozempic is a fully mobile pen device that improves glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and contributes to weight loss. Saxenda is administered as an injection for obesity once daily 3mg, administered along with diet and exercise. Ozempic is administered as an injection for type 2 diabetes once daily 0.25mg to 2mg, administered along with diet and exercise.

Shin splints are usually caused by overuse of the glutes. Overuse of the glutes can cause tendons in the lower leg (such as the Achilles) to stretch and break, resulting in shin splints. Overuse of the glutes can happen if you wear shoes that don\u2019t have enough room and are too tight.\n\nYou can also get shin splints if you wear shoes that fit too tight and put pressure on your feet. If you wear shoes that are tight in one area and loose in another, you may develop shin splints from the extra pressure on those areas. This is especially true when you wear shoes that are too long or too wide.\n\nOveruse of the glutes can occur if your calves and hamstrings are tight, so make sure to stretch them every few days to avoid this.\n\nIf you have shin splints, it\u2019s important to stop using your feet and get them stretched out before they continue to hurt. The best way to do this is to use a tennis ball in the area where the shin splints are located. Roll the ball under your foot until the easy part of the ball almost reaches your heel. This will stretch the muscles in your feet and legs.\n\nYou can also use an ice bag or cold water to help soothe the pain, but remember to ice it only for 10 minutes at a time, three times a day at first, then only for five minutes at a time if you need to.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with shin splints and other issues in your feet and lower body, you may choose to see a doctor to help ensure you get rid of the pain.

During that time, my doctor prescribed Wellbutrin to me and I immediately began to notice changes. I felt like those changes had happened overnight, but I also know that wasn\u2019t possible. Darling, it took awhile. So how long does it take to notice the effects of Wellbutrin? Read my personal experience below to get an idea.\n\n<em>Disclaimer: you should not start Wellbutrin without discussing it with your doctor.</em>\n\n<h3><strong><em>Side Effects</em></strong></h3>\n\nOf course, I started to notice side effects pretty early on. But I was short on cash and I knew the side effects were normal. So I didn\u2019t think much of it at first. The main Wellbutrin side effects I noticed while taking Wellbutrin were constipation and insomnia. The constipation was a real problem for me if I didn\u2019t drink enough water at first. However, I developed a habit that worked well with my stomach and my belly soon adjusted. The insomnia lasted awhile too, but I did notice something else. I was able to get back to sleep easier than usual. So it didn\u2019t bother me that much. What really stuck out to me about the Melch and my side effects was what I noticed AFTER I stopped taking it.\n\n<h3><em><strong>Side Effects</strong></em> <strong><em>Long After Stopping Wellbutrin</em></strong></h3>\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since Wellbutrin xl first worked its magic on my brain and my health. My current job is hard. Really hard. BUT before Wellbutrin xl, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to work in my current position. I had trouble concentrating in my previous positions and used to struggle with procrastination and poor execution at work. I even had a problem focusing while I was working on my book. Wellbutrin changed all that. So, my answer to the question \u201chow long does it take to notice the effects of Wellbutrin\u201d is 3 months or less. So lets talk about what\u2019s been happening once I stopped taking Wellbutrin because when I stopped my brain chemistry changed. And my mental health took a nosedive.\n\n<h3><strong><em>Sexual Pleasure</em></strong></h3>\n\nWhen my brain chemistry changed and something I thought I had nailed down on the first try went topsy-turvy because I stopped taking Wellbutrin.

The question will require you to make decision regarding the revision of the reading selection.\n\nHave you ever driven down the road, seemingly at ease, perhaps exceeding the speed limit to arrive at your destination a little bit more quickly. Then you see a long line of cars waiting in line to pay the toll and realize that you now have to join them and become one of the poor idiots wasting time and costly gasoline. People have engaged in this meaningless exercise ever since toll roads and toll bridges were invented. Stop, go a few feet, brake, stop again, and then repeat the process more times than you can count as cars jostle for better positions like basketball players near the hoop. <strong>Dilatory</strong> drivers nervously dig in ashtrays and between car seats, fumbling for the correct change, dropping coins on the ground or attempting to back up, or their cars scrape the side of the tollbooth, leaving paint chips and chipped concrete as permanent marks of futility. Sometimes you're in line for ten minutes or more before you reach the toll-taker and surrender your quarter, dollar, or life savings for the privilege of being on a supposedly fast route home.\n\nModern technology has finally given drivers the means of escaping the horrors of paying tolls by hand. New microchip transmitters affixed to windshields can be read by machines above the tollbooths, and the charges are billed automatically to drivers' credit cards. This easy process requires drivers to register their cars, set up accounts, and pay the bill, that's all there is to it, it's as simple as that. The driver can pass through the toll lane without stopping, while the fools in the pay-by-cash lane wait their turns.\n\nThe rewards of using the simple, plastic stick-ons are enormous: drivers save time and gas; some states", "If you have been taking medication for a specific condition, you\u2019re probably eager to start feeling its effects.\n\nThis is especially true because doctors don\u2019t prescribe medications without a reason.

These illnesses make it hard for people to function socially, at work, and sometimes even lead people to the more dangerous ways of trying to cope.\n\nThese medications affect the human body in different ways depending on their formula and properties.\n\nIf you\u2019re starting a new drug, remember this golden rule: the first few days of taking it can be scary. That comes with the possibility that you\u2019ll have about a 60% chance at getting a first-day reaction to the medicine.\n\nSo what the first time you\u2019re feeling things like a prominent weight gain, cardiac palpitations and discomfort, or even confusion, it\u2019s best to topple the thought that it\u2019s the specific medication as the culprit. You might as well mention these to your doctor so they can delve into it. Or even better, check it out yourself.\n\nAfter the first couple of days, you can check yourself for any sort of improvement or effect on how you feel. If neither of those has happened, that\u2019s okay. In that case, you may need a dosage adjustment.\n\nSoon enough, usually in two weeks to a month, you\u2019ll start feeling a lot better.\n\nIn some cases where you still do not feel the efficacy of the medication, there are other alternatives that go beyond non-pharmaceutical ways.

If you have insomnia and have hard time sleeping, then melatonin supplement can help solve poor sleeping problems.", "The America Academy of Sleep Medicine & Sleep Research Society recommends you take 3mg of melatonin at night.\n\nMelatonin is one of the most used supplements for sleep issues. However, there has been little guidance on the actual amount to take for optimal sleep. A recent study by Rodney J. Gilmore and David J. Posey may answer the melatonin dosage question. The researchers tested five phases of a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment among healthy adults. Each phase administered either a low dose (0.5 mg), intermediate dose (1 mg), or a high dose (3 mg) of melatonin in otherwise canopy-treated cocktail. They studied participants before bed to see how many hours of good-quality sleep each participant received after receiving one of the three doses of melatonin. They also assessed how quickly participants fell asleep when given the three doses of the sleep supplement.\n\n<h4>Study Results</h4>\n\nThe results were interesting. Both the intermediate and high doses of melatonin significantly increased sleep efficiency with minimal awake time compared to the placebo group. But, it is important to note that the same study results were consistent between both intermediates and high doses. This means taking 1mg and 3mg of melatonin yielded the same outcomes. So, you can take 1mg if you want to avoid taking more than you need. Or if you want to avoid the adverse effects of taking more. Most users will experience fast sleep and a pleasant night of sleep with about 1mg of melatonin per night.\n\nThe research also concluded that the higher dosage of melatonin is effective. In other words, 1mg and 3mg achieve the same quick fall asleep time and sleep quality improvement. Even though 1mg dosage of melatonin is the most recommended amount of melatonin, I would not be against taking 3mg.

Maybe it is written somewhere there is no problem with a message like \u201ca green caravan has run off with a bank deposit.\u201d\n\nThe biggest problem with most of these mysteries is they seem to always have the same meaning, no matter how off course the words may be, even though the words may make no logical sense at all.\n\nJust the other day the police received a call from a 5-year-old boy who said someone had broken into his closet. The little boy\u2019s father, a naturally caring and understanding man, called the police, thinking that someone had broken into their home.\n\nAmazingly, the officer who answered the call and came out to help the boy and his frantic father actually responded according to the police handbook.\n\nLife can be just as sad and confining for robots, too. No fooling around with robots is a real hype these days.\n\nI happen to be a great fan of a super robot named Odie, the cartoon dog from \u201cGarfield.\u201d Regardless of all the goofy behavior he performs, I love the little guy for his innocence and his caring attitude. I even think from the way he\u2019s been thinking and from all the things he does, he must be a virtual genius.\n\nCase in point: Remember the time Odie resolved to do better in school by deciding that he would no longer look at his textbook", "By <strong>Anon</strong> from LUM-COLO-SD on 14 Mar 2021, 15:24\n\nFor the record, the Walser family just lost my business for life.\n\nBy <strong>joe goat</strong> from Mine Eyes Can See on 14 Mar 2021, 15:00\n\nJust a question ... I could run up a big bill at the house down the street. Why would Walser be responsible for anything but a rental property, as real estate goes. If Doug was so embarrassed to drive the car into the house, why did he smash windows on the next door neighbor's house in the process. According to the report, Doug revealed that he didn't even know which house he smashed into. And with no insurance, Doug's Qu\u1eadn \u1ee7y motto is Superb!\n\nBy <strong>Steve</strong> from Mine Eyes Can See on 14 Mar 2021, 13:47\n\nWalser should not be named in relation to a vehicle accident or crash. It is neither a crash nor an accident, it is a blatant, indisputable and intentional Action of someone crashing their vehicle into a neighbor\u2019s house. He destroyed the houses of his neighbor and Walser, and in the process have damaged his life way beyond the walls of those two homes. I sincerely hope he is investigated for criminal activity because he was clearly seizing control of his vehicle but rather swerving or correcting and backing over a fire hydrant again either singing or swerving and taking out a neighbors telephone pole then clearing through that individual\u2019s driveway while crashing into two different houses in two different situations. Had his car been on fire there\u2019s no way that he or the insurance company would not accept some sort of responsibility for the events that ensued. Insurance coverage would never have been the question at that time it would have been what will they do with the remains of these cars and there\u2019s nobody in their right mind that would think that the wreckage was worth a penny. Sadly I don\u2019t think he realizes that such a vehicle will never be useable again. thank goodness no one was standing in the house as it came blasting through the garage and destroyed not only the structure but part of in the neighbors\u2019 home on the other side. The force likely shook other homes nearby as well. This is a wakeup call for all OBI wannabes. I am also thankful that he doesn\u2019t live two miles away from the police station.", "I updated my weigh in post for this month and for the life of me I cannot understand why my weight has been this stable when I have been consuming approximately 6000 calories a day. Although my calories dropped tremendously, my weight dropped a little then hovered just above what it's been. Now I think I read somewhere when I was initially doing the PALM stuff that once a body gets down to the appropriate weight for its height or whatever then that's it, that's as low as it goes and you have to do more activity. The problem is that I have a job and can't just say I'm doing Palm and if they ask me to change or move something then that's fine. I am significantly more active than I've ever been. I can only assume that this enlarged prostate is also causing reduced testosterone levels or something? Just trying to make sense of it because the only way I can see that my weight has been stable is because of my increased activity levels. I can't remember the last time I had a bowel movement either sadly, it's been 10 days and I sometimes feel like I need a laxative because of the bloating, nausea and painful gas but I'm afraid to try that because I don't want to jeopardize my options.\n\nThanks,\nLoi.", "A. Shapiro, MD\n\nMore than 30 percent of men by age 60 and nearly 80 percent of males by age 80 are plagued by an enlarged prostate. This is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), to distinguish it from prostate cancer, which is not always concordant with an enlarged prostate. Although common in older males, it can develop prematurely and should be evaluated in younger men.\n\nEnlarged prostate causes symptoms of urinary obstruction including increases in the volume, time, number and difficulty of urine production. A story that may be the most common among your diabetic friends is difficulty producing urine after meals \u2014 a classic symptom. Complications can include infections resulting from a chronic urinary retention and accumulating urine, bladder damage metastasizing and developing into prostate cancer.\n\nThe main treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms, and this can be accomplished either pharmacologically or through surgery. While surgery is quite safe and effective, it can result in erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction as well as incontinence.\n\nThere are medication options, the most common being the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride (Proscar, ProNed). This medicine is taken twice daily and works by preventing some prostate cells from developing. This treatment is very effective if treatment is started early only. It may take six to nine months for the medicine to work.\n\nAlpha-hancing drugs work by blocking enzymes which signal the sphincter to stay constricted. This constant contraction forces the muscles around the urethra to work harder in turning off the water flow. A decrease in blood flow can also restrict residual urine flow. This can result in infection and other urinary tract problems. Alpha-hancing drugs relieve this and the result is quicker and/or stronger urine stream, and a reduction in bothersome symptoms. Some of the possible side effects include headache, insomnia, daytime drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, flatulence and sexual problems. Having stress or physical exertion may worsen symptoms.\n\nBotulinum toxin can be used if medications fail. It is useful as an adjunct to medication. This is a drug that is custom made to fit inside a urinary catheter, which is placed into the urethra for 10 to 15 minutes twice weekly. This technique may block the production of acetylcholine, a chemical substance that signals the bladder sphincter muscles to constrict.\n\nPDE 5 inhibitors have also been used successfully. Viagra, Cialis and Levitra help men with BPH improve their ability to get and maintain erections. They do this by restoring blood flow", "i am 26 yrs old, and i know the feeling. i have just been through the complete horror skin infection and all. but i am getting there. reading others studys and haveing a plan is helping a lot.

So to substitute a higher volume of protein (egg whites) we can still get the full amount from food intake (45-60g) which is what we need daily. From what I am hearing from so many people, including my dr, our appetite is very much a hit or miss thing from everyone\u2019s perspective. I don\u2019t want to be going shopping for weeks to find meals that are palatable and safe enough for our tiny pureysto\u2019s. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My argument is why can\u2019t we just not force feed this protein, when we are already struggle with our goals. I should be able to sub out some of the protein requirements in my pre made foods if I want to. If we are struggling to get by on 200-300 calories and you want me to follow up with 60 more of liquid (which brings me in to a few more hundred calories) but then to follow up that with more protein (egg whites) cuz the protein shakes are not good enough? \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so frustrated and upset.

For instance I used to have heart arthrial for the last 20 years.  About a year ago we were too busy to get our vitamin/mineral tests done but had continued our supplements. I later found out I had too much calcium so I got to the root cause by listening to what my body was telling me and it hasn't been an issue since.  \n\nIts good to understand how your vitamins supplements are being pumping in your blood.\n\nMany people do trust test kits.

I think you\u2019ll be disappointed when I tell you that there is no pill or injection that takes the place of a blood test to measure the body\u2019s hormones. There are diets that will sustain hormone levels and we try to explain to people that if they test and have a large amount of hormone in storage they can not use it. We say if you have a part of a newspaper and throw it in the trash knowing the news in it you still have the whole paper in your house and know that you can get access to any news with a simple swipe, you need only to get out your trash can, go to it, open it and take out the day\u2019s newspaper. It is the same with thyroid hormone if you have a large supply even a lazy gland is still able to let you know to slide your arm through the drawer to what you need. Now some people think that a replacement dose is needed because you do not get the feedback and thyroxine pills are easy to attack, you need to know that they are too slow a delivery system for the body and your body works best by getting a daily number of thyroxine pills and they are not intended to be used by people who do not take the necessary steps toward a healthy living, you need the good hormone like Rob Lowe and if you don\u2019t do your work you are fired. Always consult your healthcare providers because I do not get paid for a consultation only for medication.

That it was cautioned to have cellulitis and casease bottom, not to be together in small space (like jail cells) in short time in order not to catch shingles. Very rare to catch it. What is the cause of 'shingles' ? Thanks for your valuable years of teaching ..... Anne S.\n\nIt sure would be nice if medical care facilities would accept patients with these symptoms and spend a short time treating anyone with any known health problems. A single ER trip would have ended both cases for these men. Simple care costs less in the long run. Even the food served by the correctional facility would help keep them alive long enough to see a doctor. My heart goes out to them for these type of controlling careless hospital centers to exists. I am sure this goes in their report of strangling tax dollars spent on medical costs but nothing done to end such horrible neglect. Probably none of us will solve this dilemma but those are the facts.\n\nShingles may not be that common but it is no doubt a very painful affliction. I think all too often we hear about patients being let down by institutional processes.\n\nIt does however look like they have been found fit to stand trial so hopefully they will get their day in court eventually.\n\nHi newsback, I have read that it can happen but it would be rare. It would depend on whether the same viral strain of shingles was contracted. Another factor would be if the immune system was stable enough to fight it off when it was contracted. The fear of contracting a second shingles flare-up is one of the reasons why patients focus on self-help.", "I had shingles for the third time in October this year. My first one was when I was about 14, the rash lasted about 3 weeks but I had very few of the rash in one finger region. The second one was when I was about 19 and I had the rash over my rib cage with fever, muscles aching and I thought I had the flu. It last about 2-3 weeks. The third one was also around my rib cage, starting with rash and muscles aching and then hot and cold alternative throughout day. It lasted about 2 weeks, but gave a lot of pain in the joints. I was also very tired.\n\nWhen were these two? Were you a little older than this poster? A little older. I wonder if they don't get too many cases in states that are so hot year round as my case was rare even though I was the worse case ever in the hospital.\n\nYour situation may be unrelated, it takes 20 years for the vaccine to wear off. God knows this changes with time. My general answer is yes it can happen, near where the first case was seems to be a factor but not every time.

Because without any immune system booster for a whole year there is no way for the vaccine to take some effect and that's because loading does not become part of the immune system since it has been so dangerous. That's also why I have been double dosed already and loading like it takes years for the body and opens up infection again.\n\nWhat do you write for the virus because even though you can inject, the vaccine through the spinal disc in something easy to the brain doesn't penetrate a layer of cells called meningeal cells and if that \"liquid\" is the only way into the brain its very near to impossible.\n\nLoading was going to last", "Yes, you can get shingles more than once.

However, if you seek these providers through private email, don't disclose the name of your previous doctor or legitimate physician at all (well, unless you'd like for your new doctor to know) because now more than ever, providers qualify their patients in what is known as 'pain and pleasure'.\n\nRight to the point, a lot of primary care physicians don't want to take care of people with substance abuse and substance use disorders, or history. However, a lot of doctors from East Tennessee Webster University, they come out of or graduated to 90 days to six months and then start back-to-back cases and once it's a routine and then they started dealing with this issue.\n\nBut as soon as they stick around, they're going home in two to three years from now, and they start really caring less about how they dose and how much amount of patients that they're working with.

Prozac is associated with withdrawal effects if stopped suddenly. Withdrawal is much more likely if the drug is administered for an extended period of time. The most common withdrawal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, run-of-the-mill flu-like symptoms such as chills, muscle aches, dizziness, fatigue, and drowsiness etc. Prozac is not associated with overdosing leading to fatality. If you are experiencing worsening of symptoms while taking Prozac, you should let your doctor know so that a different medication can be substituted.\n\nHi there,\n\nIrrespective of duration of use of Prozac that you have taken, one should decide to stop upon discussion with your doctor. Withdrawal effects may have occurred even without the doctor. But if you decide to stop, you need taper it slowly more so if you have taken it for a period of time. Sudden stop or cut off will trigger off withdrawal effects. And the risks increase further if you have underlying disorder like PTSD, OCD, anxiety or depression. That is why it is important to keep discussing with your doctor if you plan to stop it. The doctor has a method to do this. The doctor would have started it with very low dosage and increase it to optimum levels. And would reduce it slowly to zero with some interval of time. But I advise you discuss this with the doctor who gave Prozac and let her do the magazine for you. Thanks.", "Please do not just stop taking your medications.

I'd highly suggest talking to the professional who helped you with the prescription.\nSince it's an S4 and the patient often start feeling relief within 10 days, I would suggest reducing the drug gradually to see if her symptoms reoccur.

Consult you pharmacist or your clinician for dosage adjustment or alternative medications.\nSuicidal behavior is serious and very important to monitor. If he is planning or attempting suicide or begins to display those behaviors, call 911 or get to ER.\nIf patient has an appointment with primary care physician, that issue may be discussed. If very serious, the doctor may address immediately. Causes of suicidal ideation include GAD, Bipolar Disorder, Comorbidities (other psychiatric illness), Depression and Drug Abuse.

Other issues that can cause suicidal behaviors are relationship breakdown or stress, Death of a loved one, trauma, life circumstances getting on top of a person, History of Suicide Attempts, Prior Self-Harm, Early onset of Mental Illness, Alcohol abuse, Drug abuse (caffeine, nicotine, stimulants).

This time I went for 2 weeks of tapering before stopping taking it altogether (she said because I had taken it for 11 years. Worked like a charm, no awful side effects. This lasted for a grand total of 2 weeks after which the same thing happened and I was back at the clinic. This time I was on no man's land and was given Lorazepam (you know those ultra-calm pills in Nurse Jackie's case box) He said I didn't have the option of going another 2 weeks as I suffered from some type of acute MDD (this was confirmed by me not only not going to work, running away from my friends, and becoming grossly irritable) that was only treatable in the 2 week period. He prescribed 2 mg/day for the first week, then 1 mg/day for the 2nd week. This broke the cycle for me and I began to enjoy my life. I weened off the xanax after 10 months (I did not go to the Dr about this; just didn't reorder it.

I refused the Celexa and began to taper off the Xanax using the usual methods (give them to a friend who doesn't know the load, take them only when needed, don't take them the minute you feel anxious, etc. Eventually I got down to 1/4 of a 2 mg pill before I was ready to be done (but this took roughly 2 years as you can imagine) After that I think the Xanax caused more anxiety when I'"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.0149, "rouge1_r": 0.0032, "rouge1_f1": 0.0053, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0149, "rougel_r": 0.0032, "rougel_f1": 0.0053, "bleurt": 0.3395, "bert_score_p": 0.7485, "bert_score_r": 0.8115, "bert_score_f1": 0.7788, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 20.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.2985, "rouge1_r": 0.1031, "rouge1_f1": 0.1533, "rouge2_p": 0.0152, "rouge2_r": 0.0052, "rouge2_f1": 0.0077, "rougel_p": 0.1343, "rougel_r": 0.0464, "rougel_f1": 0.069, "bleurt": 0.2403, "bert_score_p": 0.808, "bert_score_r": 0.828, "bert_score_f1": 0.8179, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 60.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5075, "rouge1_r": 0.0909, "rouge1_f1": 0.1542, "rouge2_p": 0.0606, "rouge2_r": 0.0107, "rouge2_f1": 0.0182, "rougel_p": 0.2985, "rougel_r": 0.0535, "rougel_f1": 0.0907, "bleurt": 0.2783, "bert_score_p": 0.7859, "bert_score_r": 0.849, "bert_score_f1": 0.8162, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 60.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4328, "rouge1_r": 0.1124, "rouge1_f1": 0.1785, "rouge2_p": 0.0909, "rouge2_r": 0.0233, "rouge2_f1": 0.0372, "rougel_p": 0.209, "rougel_r": 0.0543, "rougel_f1": 0.0862, "bleurt": 0.3512, "bert_score_p": 0.8206, "bert_score_r": 0.8467, "bert_score_f1": 0.8334, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 80.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5075, "rouge1_r": 0.0821, "rouge1_f1": 0.1414, "rouge2_p": 0.0152, "rouge2_r": 0.0024, "rouge2_f1": 0.0042, "rougel_p": 0.2388, "rougel_r": 0.0386, "rougel_f1": 0.0665, "bleurt": 0.3159, "bert_score_p": 0.7912, "bert_score_r": 0.8511, "bert_score_f1": 0.8201, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 60.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3433, "rouge1_r": 0.0542, "rouge1_f1": 0.0937, "rouge2_p": 0.0455, "rouge2_r": 0.0071, "rouge2_f1": 0.0123, "rougel_p": 0.194, "rougel_r": 0.0307, "rougel_f1": 0.053, "bleurt": 0.2917, "bert_score_p": 0.7979, "bert_score_r": 0.8335, "bert_score_f1": 0.8153, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 20.0}]}

It will be irritated more and hurt more if you use it hard.  Nothing to be done but wait for some time off the heavy stuff and give it a chance to heal.  You could try stretching first and it might help a tiny bit, but not by much.  It may also reduce the difference in pain between the two arms if they have bursitis like this.\n\n\n...if I learned anything from training heavy muscle afterwards (not stretching) allowed for a decrease in pain level. Hope this helps.\n\"I am a welder,builder in a small working group of four, the rate of loading/unloading coals from the tractor is very low so the load is getting heavy some time up to 25kgs. I work with another big guy also. Could it be a weakness because of my average BMI of 22 and small bone structure? The heavy workload is unavoidable for with this load spring/autumn/winter seasons which my coworkers and I have to take care of.\"\n\nAs You are in your early 20s and of low body weight, You seem not to have any degenerative spinal disc problems.

The muscles are not designed", "This is not the case. Whenever it\u2019s sore I take an OTC pain reliever like Ibuprofen to relieve the pain.\n\nI broke my AC and it hurt like what you\u2019re describing. I was in braces though. It took about 4-6 weeks for the pain to go away. Does it hurt to do overhead exercises?\n\nHappened to me. Im fine now, what were you doing when it happened? Did you fall on it somehow? Did you get hit in the face or something?\n\nBasically what somebody said above, 4-6 weeks to heal but it should only take 2-4 to quit hurting so badly.\n\nEDIT: You should be fine to workout but I'd just avoid any pushing movements like pushups or bench and just do about 45 mins as long as it's not to painful.\n\nLook into preventative range of motion post infection. They will make sure that the range is preserved and you won't have any residual pain.\n\nI broke my collar bone from skateboarding, came to a sudden stop and the shoulder reagripped on the pavement.

Also, get steroid injection from a doctor. You have mild AC sprain. These injections are made for what you have right now (I had pretty big one 20 lives ago).\n\nEdit - a month ago, my friend had to see a neurologist because of shoulder pain. Doc found out that over course of period of 4-5 years she gave herself a tendonitis on shoulder.

There are two main points to consider\n1- Generic drugs are safe and degrades quickly once it is no longer useful for the stomach\n2- Unique patents protect the drug from getting expired while you are still making profit\nSo once you understand #2, you will see that the drug will get expired when the unique patent / copyright ends. If the drug is composed of multiple ingredients, where one or more are in unique patent protection, then the expiration is modified accordingly accordingly.

It sounds like you have a pretty good handle on this already, but when in doubt it is always a good idea to visit with your doctor or primary care physician for further assessment \u2014 especially when your questions have to do with taking more than the recommended dosage.\n\nWhenever adding or adjusting dosages of any medications, it\u2019s most important not to do so without discussing it with your treating doctor first. This, as you know, can be dangerous for health and may be detrimental to the overall effectiveness and clinical benefits. In fact, Treatment III in the Mayo Clinic study lead by Dr. Garcia-Altesauges concluded that Buspar was able to produce desired benefit results but that clonazepam was not in patients who did not tolerate Buspar because of its undesirable autonomic side effects.\n\nOur forums are all about personal experiences, tips and tricks to facilitate the well-being of others. What questions do you have about this particular combination of medications? I\u2019m sure the presence of the Mayo Clinic expert will bring in a great deal of information for you to evaluate, but it may be useful for other members to hear about your appointment with your physician and any answers they may have.\n\nTake advantage of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, I\u2019m positive you\u2019ll be glad you did!\n\nDo anyone have any ideas they would like to share? I would like to try to get off of the Lexapro and find a natural substitution.  Anyone have any allergies or reactions to Buspar?\n\nBuspar is pretty benign. It\u2019s got minimal serious adverse effects, most of which are rare. It is a common treatment for anxiety though you can have it on its own. It acts quite differently than benzos and SSRIs like lexapro. Yes, it can be discontinued when switching medicines.\n\nGabapentin\n\nJust tried a higher Buspar dose \u2013 not prescribed by my neurologist \u2013 incredibly tired.

{"Question": "Is blepharitis contagious?", "Free_form_answer": "Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid that causes red, swollen, and irritated eyelids. The exact cause of blepharitis is unknown, but it might be associated with bacterial buildup, seborrheic dermatitis, clogged oil glands in the eyelids, rosacea, allergies, and eyelash mites.

If your chronic blepharitis is caused by demodex, it makes sense that you could pass it on. However, if you have rosacea, there's never a cause for blepharitis, and everyone has demodex mites. It also doesn't make sense for contact with other people's eyes to transfer demodex, either. I'd be interested in your opinion, please! Hairdressers, for example, are more prone to blepharitis. They use a ton of products on their hair, which ends up on your eyelids daily. The reason blepharitis recurs is most likely shampoo or other substances are clogging the pores on your eyelid. So, blepharitis is contagious if you train from a dandruff or cream to manage it.\n\nBlepharitis is contagious when it is caused by Malassezia Folliculitis, also known as dandruff. When an individual has dandruff and has their hairdo, the dandruff goes down to the eyelid and ends up clogging the pores. These microscopic organisms rise up to the skin's surface and make pores to the eyelid. Concomitantly blepharitis begins to create and can, in the long run, prompt different contaminations. Contagious blepharitis is Malassezia Folliculitis. Bacterial blepharitis is non-infectious.\n\nBlepharitis isn't contagious. The reason of blepharitis are microscopic organisms (in some infection and dandruff is to blame). Coming up, I will talk with Dru M. Heck, MD about Blepharitis so you know why it isn't contagious and how to ensure you don't create it. I have blepharitis in the past and dealing with dandruff promptly, my eyes began to feel a lot better. Many individuals have dandruff, less individuals understand they need to likewise have an eyelid cleanser, which can assist with controlling the microscopic organisms.\n\nBlepharitis is <strong>not contagious.</strong>\n\nWhether or not blepharitis is contagious, <strong>the amount of the time infective agents that can cause infection can be transferred between persons</strong>.\n\nThe most common cause? <strong>Bacterial blepharitis. </strong>Bacterial blepharitis is almost never contagious and doesn\u2019t spread from person to person.\n\n<strong>It is common for people with dandruff or eczema to get bacterial blepharitis as the conditions can cause", "Is blepharitis contagious to another person? Yes and no. Although possibly most people with blepharitis haven\u2019t spread it to anyone else, the bacteria that cause most cases can spread and cause blepharitis. Thus, it can be viewed as contagious in some ways. However, it is often not contagious.\n\nA condition is defined as contagious if it can spread through direct contact without medical intervention. These bacteria often come indirectly from contact with an infected person. Without treating the root cause of blepharitis, blepharitis can return.\n\nOther conditions that can be spread to others through direct contact include:\n\n* herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores\n* syphilis\n* scabies\n\nBlepharitis can spread by coming in contact with the bacteria or scabs that come from another person\u2019s blepharitis.\n\nCan you catch it from a pet?\n\nThe answer is yes, if that pet has blepharitis. Pets suffer from many of the same ailments we do. Many suffer from inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis) when they catch the same viruses or bacteria that cause it in humans. For example, staphylococcus bacteria (called \u201cstaph\u201d) and bacteria that live on the skin (\u201cdandruff\u201d) can be very contagious. A wild animal, like a coyote or squirrel, is not likely to have blepharitis, though.\n\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n\nThe treatment plan for blepharitis involves addressing all the underlying causes of the infection. This can involve a combination of eyelid wipes, warm compresses, topical medications, and lifestyle changes.\n\nThe bacteria that cause blepharitis are usually located at the root of the eyelashes, or the lash follicles. Your doctor will often recommend cleaning your eyes with a wipe that can kill the bacteria and prevent it from spreading. Keep your hands clean and don\u2019t scratch your eyes. Wavelength wipes can be effective for this. Antibiotic eye drops or ointment can also be used, such as:\n\n* erythromycin\n* Tobradex\n* I Abril\n* azithromycin\n\n<h3><strong>Grease Warfare</strong></h3>\n\nSome cases of blepharitis are caused by blocked oil glands (ducts) in the eyelids. For this issue, heat will soften the grease in the oil glands, allowing it to run out from the edges of your eyelids. Warm compresses can be applied to the eyes for 10 minutes. This will also help relieve eye cramps.\n\n<h3><strong>Get Tough", "If so, how do you get my infection from my eyes\n\nWhen it comes to infections of the there are two types of bacterial infections, staphylococcal and streptococcal. Most people, once diagnosed, break out in a cold sweat and run from the room, especially if their child has the infection, has you seen Outbreak the Sandra Bullock movie?\n\nThe truth is staph and strep are not communicable to people if they have no risk factors. Whatever you read on the internet about how staph can get in the bloodstream is bull, describe the \u201cpatient\u201d in the case you are describing. Did mum have diabetes? Was it recurring? See, there is no single medical report that agrees on what \u201ccontagious\u201d means.\n\nIf you have no risk factors for the infection, including nasal and colon aberrant bacteria, then no.\n\nOpenness would be nice to tell you which bacteria it was\n\nNo one ever said wait till the pain returns if you have blood in your urine.

According to the National Eye Institute (NEI)Trusted Source, 60% of most people have had this condition by their 60s. Fortunately, blepharitis is not contagious.\n\nWhat causes blepharitis?\n\nThe \u201cblepharitis\u201d name comes from the Greek words for eyelid and inflammation. The primary cause of blepharitis \u2014 inflammation \u2014 can be due to:\n\n* bacterial\n* allergic causes\n* conditions like rosacea, insulin-resistant diabetes, or dry eye syndrome\n\nBlepharitis is common due to your eyelids being in contact with your face, mouth, and nose. Applying pressure to your forehead, nose, or cheeks might affect your eyesight.\n\nWhat are the symptoms and risk factors?\n\nIn addition to burning and stinging, oozing white flakes on the eyes and around eye edges are just a few symptoms of blepharitis. The affected area of the eye can become swollen and reddish-brown, causing discomfort.\n\nMore serious risks are possible, depending on how severe the condition is. Severe cases can increase the risk for incomplete eyelid closure, continuing infections, or sensitivity to light.\n\nThe general risk for the condition varies among people, with the following contributing to an elevated risk:\n\n* inflamed skin on the face\n* eczema around the eyes\n* oily or scaly skin\n* blocked oil glands\n* unwanted or premature loss of eyebrow and/or eyelash hair\n* long periods of sleep to the point where the eyelids remain shut for most of the day\n* improperly washing the lids with water, soap, or shampoo, which causes dirt and bacteria to accumulate in the eyelashes\n* prolonged overuse of contact lenses\n\nHow do you prevent and treat blepharitis?\n\nIf you have blepharitis, your treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition. Your treatment plan might include a combination of topical and antibiotic eye drops, ointments, or ointments. These ointments typically address eye issues such as:\n\n* light sensitivity\n* redness or swelling\n* bleeding\n* cornea or conjunctiva dryness\n\nFollicular pretrichal staphylococcal blepharitis is mild and rarely causes permanent damage or vision loss. However, possible home treatment options might include:\n\n* applying warm compresses on the start and end of the day to open clogged oil glands\n* washing the lashes with warm soapy water\n* using makeup", "This is a question we get a lot and no, it isn\u2019t contagious. However, it is exacerbated by lack of hygiene and a slowblinking response from our conscious mind. Although there is no cure for blepharitis, you can greatly reduce the symptoms and protect your eyes, once you know how.

After rinsing with, warm water, then salt water, vinegar/water, and peroxide/water my ear got pretty swollen so I rinsed with some alcohol and that helped it considerably, the pain is gone but the swelling still persists from more of an internal ear thing than it is from the neck swelling.

These symptoms may also cause dysfunction in the legs and arms with stiffness and problems with moving the limbs.\n\nAlong with the spinal column, an abscess can also develop on part of the spinal cord. Anyone with suspected infection of the spinal canal or cord should seek urgent medical attention.\n\nA non-painful abscess can also be caused by a mass of pus or bacteria building up and rupturing only on the outside, leaving the inside intact. However, this is likely rare, given that the body usually disperses any collections of pus as part of the natural healing process.\n\n<h3>Case studies</h3>\n\nIn March 2019, Australian scientists reported on 11 newborns with no symptoms of meningitis but all tested positive for bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid despite no sign of infection elsewhere in their body.\n\nMeningitis is inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The scientists did not find any evidence that the children had previous infections because they remained asymptomatic.\n\nSeveral of the cases deteriorated and required hospitalization for treatment, highlighting that a lack of symptoms does not mean no disease. Babies and young children are generally worse at displaying symptoms because they cannot communicate in the same way that adults can.\n\nIt is vital that anyone who notices signs of infection of the spine seeks medical attention \u2014 especially if there is no visible injury or other reason for the infection.\n\n<h3>Spinal abscesses explained</h3>\n\nA spinal abscess is a collection of pus that gathers along the spine, usually brought on by a bacterial infection. Any area of the spine may become affected, including the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar areas of the spine.\n\nIn most cases, the abscess is on the outside of the spinal cord or nerve columns rather than within the area. Spinal column confusion is usually brought about by an infection at a lower level. The location depends on where the infection spreads from.\n\nWhile it is possible to have an abscess that collects outside the body, leading to no pain or symptoms when the pus ruptures, this is likely rare.\n\nBacteria most commonly cause spinal abscesses. Lower back pain and stiffness are the most significant symptoms of a spinal abscess.\n\nThe overlying skin may become painful, warm, and red or swollen, and drainage is possible if loculation develops. Other symptoms can include:\n\n* weakness\n* numbness\n* loss of bladder or bowel control\n\nImmediate medical attention is necessary since not treating an abscess can lead to permanent spinal cord damage.", "I have had no pain post op, only tenderness when I touch it.

Thank you ??\n\nZyrtec and Claritin are breastmilk safe, but I'd suggest using your usual judgement and limit if necessary. These antihistamines don't have the same nasty metabolites many other meds do and vary in concentration in our milk.\n\nLow concentrations of loratadine (Claritin) and desloratadine (Claritin-D) have been demonstrated to pass to the sucking infant through breast milk to concentrations estimated at 5 to 30 percent the concentration of their mother (6 and 7).13,46 However, their exact concentrations of these antihistamines in breast milk have never actually been determined.\n\nHowever, if Desloratadine and Loratadine is considered to be the safest and best antihistamine choice for a breastfeeding woman when compared with alternative medications, Herberg et al.14 conducted a study to determine the actual concentrations of desloratadine and loratadine for Loratadine in dogs and human breast milk.

{"Question": "Is meloxicam same as naproxen?", "Free_form_answer": "Meloxicam (Mobic) and Naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve) are two different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They are both used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation, but there are some differences between them.\nMeloxicam and Naproxen are both prescribed for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, Naproxen is also prescribed for ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis, bursitis, and gout attacks. \nMeloxicam is only available with a prescription, whereas Naproxen can be found over-the-counter (OTC).

The most common symptoms are a rash, itching, and swelling.\n\nThe rash can appear anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the face, arms, and legs. The rash is usually red and bumpy, and it may be accompanied by blisters.\n\nThe itching can be severe and can last for several days. The swelling can also be severe and can last for several days.\n\nHow can I prevent poison ivy?\n\nThe best way to prevent poison ivy is to avoid contact with the plant. If you are hiking or camping in an area where poison ivy is common, wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts.\n\nYou should also wear gloves and boots to protect your hands and feet. If you do come into contact with poison ivy, wash the affected area immediately with soap and water.\n\nIf you have a severe reaction to poison ivy, you should see a doctor.\n\nHow can I treat poison ivy?\n\nThere are a number of over-the-counter treatments for poison ivy.

These plants contain the oil urushiol, which can affect anyone who comes into contact with it.\n\nUrushiol is described as an allergen, not a virus. Urushiol is exactly what\u2019s making you itch when you come in contact with poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac. Up to 80% of people are prone to allergic reactions from this oil. \n\nUrushiol is lipophilic, meaning that it is fat-soluble. It loves the skin oils and can quickly bond with them. Therefore, avoid touching your face and any other sensitive areas after touching any of these plants. Especially when fabric has been contaminated. \n\n<h2>Symptoms of Poison Ivy</h2>\n\nPeople don\u2019t necessarily react to poisonous plants the same way, so symptoms can range. This includes getting a rash in mild cases or being completely unaffected. However, the poison ivy rash is a common reaction.\n\nIt\u2019s most noticeable on skin because urushiol sticks to it. Once bond to your skin\u2019s surface, urushiol breaks down the skin cells and provokes your immune system to an allergic reaction.\n\nSecondary contact, like scratching and touching fabric used with poison ivy, can increase the risk of a reaction to the rash. This is important to know, so you can prevent symptoms from spreading.\n\nWhen urushiol is on your skin, you can expect a rash within two to three days of exposure. Some people won\u2019t have any reaction, and others might get the rash elsewhere when they touch their face or neck. The rash can last from four to 12 days.\n\n<h2>Treatments for Poison Ivy</h2>\n\nYou may do your initial treatment at home, and there are a variety of treatment options to choose. \n\n<strong>Epsom salts.</strong> This work to ease symptoms by decreasing the itching feeling and pulling the oil away from your skin. Soak in them in a full bath or use as a compress for symptomatic relief. Not only is this option natural, but it\u2019s also gentle for your skin.\n\n<strong>Oatmeal and calamine.</strong> These can soothe your itchy skin and lessen your discomfort. Another option to use after a bath is applying it directly to your skin as an oatmeal paste.\n\n<strong>Anti-itch creams.</strong> Topical creams can be helpful because of their off-label use to treat poisonous plant reactions, and it\u2019s best to ask your healthcare provider before using them. Some over-the-counter products include antihistamines, which", "Yes, and no. The answer basically depends on how the poison ivy is spread \u2013 someone can become infected by being physically touched by poison ivy plant or from touching the plant\u2019s sap. But merely touching or brushing against a person who has already come in contact with the plant will not have that same effect. It\u2019s later type of transmission that some people believe exists and can be contagious.\n\nAll kinds of poisonous plants contain urushiol, an oil. Urushiol oil can appear on pet\u2019s fur or the skin of children if they play in poison ivy. People can get this urushiol resin on themselves if they touch an animal or child with the sap on their skin. Typically, dermatologists will say that the urushiol oil can not be spread in this manner.\n\nHowever, it is possible for urushiol to become airborne in its dry form and it can contaminate clothing, shoes, and materials such as tools, garden equipment, paint brushes, and pet fur. These items may continue to carry and release the urushiol resin even after it is cleaned. Whenever you are overwintering your tools and equipment, it is wise to clean and store them properly. When you grab for them next year, they won\u2019t cause yet another rash.\n\nBottles of poison ivy soap are available online or in a drugstore. The key to using it is to wash any surfaces, including your skin, thoroughly soon after touching poison ivy. If a sap-stained item is cleaned quickly, the treatment will be helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible for the oil to stay on fabric for a long time, and anything that isn\u2019t washed with soap and water, such as gloves or other equipment, can release urushiol even after cleaning. It would be smarter not to dry clean clothes that carried the resin. Although the oil will be removed as fresh dirt is brushed away, the poison ivy will not be gone.\n\nIn rare cases, I\u2019ve heard people use chemicals to clean their belongings. Isobutanol (isopropyl alcohol), isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) and GEORGIA TECH BOTH CAN PURIFIED is readily available in drugstores and material or grocery stores. (Do not use acetone\u2014it can damage plastic.)\n\nThe sap can be diluted by washing with urushiols in boiling clean water. Make an aqueous solution of urushiols and use it as a disinfectant. However, it will take a lot of time and scrubbing. Even though this procedure is clearing the urush", "Absolutely not. Poison ivy cannot be transmitted from one person to another. It's not a viral or bacterial infection. It's not communicable that way.\n\nHowever, a poison ivy rash can spread between parts of your own body, because the oils from the plant stick to your skin and that makes it possible for the rash to go to other regions.\n\nThe oil that causes a rash is called urushiol. A poison ivy plant releases urushiol into the air, and that forms a film on berries, leaves, and stems. When poison ivy rubs against your skin and then you scratch, more urushiol from the former plant areas on your skin is transferred to other regions.\n\nThe best way to prevent this is to wash your skin and clothing with unbiased soap and water after contact with poison ivy.\n\nThe itch caused by poison ivy is one of the most common reasons that people take a trip to UrgentMed to get help. Unless you have a serious allergies, poison ivy rash usually clears up in 2-3 weeks without special treatment.\n\n<h2>How can a poison ivy rash spread?</h2>\n\nThere are a few ways poison ivy can spread:\n\nScratching\n\nAs painful as the itch can be, you need to be careful what you scratch. If you scratch a poison ivy rash, there's a chance you might rub some urushiol on an untainted area. Once you itch, you can cause the spread of that rash.\n\nClothing\n\nCloth can harbor urushiol. When clothes are rubbed against the skin, they can keep the oil on your clothes and make the rash spread to other parts of your body like collars and sleeves.\n\nPets\n\nVery unusually, pets can be allergic to poison ivy. If you have a pet and they are allergic to poison ivy, then that allergy may be transmitted through your pet. That means that the oils on your pet's fur can spread to other areas of your skin or furniture, and result in a poison ivy rash on you or your furniture.\n\nUrushiol can stay on a surface for a long time. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests that you mop up floors, wipe furniture, and wash your linens after contact with poison ivy. Because urushiol can stay on items for 4-5 years, it's essential to do your best to take off all of it.\n\nIt's ok to wash your pet who might be exposed to poison ivy. Their fur is functioning as a barrier for them. Make sure to wash", "That\u2019s  a good question, but one we can\u2019t answer. To diagnose poison ivy we use a list of criteria like rash image, medical history, family history, environmental exposure, and of course, the must-see symptom a rash.  We also perform a scratch and rub test on all patients diagnosed with poison ivy. This helps to confirm our diagnosis and the patch test rules out any questionable cases, and whether medicine is necessary. Now, here\u2019s what we do know. The irritant that causes poison ivy, is called urushiol. It\u2019s a resinous oily compound that the vine and other plants in the genus Toxicodendron produce. It\u2019s also found in white oak, black walnut tree, and pretzel trees. This fluid actually gets secreted as part of the plant\u2019s self-defense mechanism. Urushiol is the main cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Common signs of poison ivy exposure are rashes, blisters, and bumps that itch a lot. But are there complications associated with poison ivy diseases?  Well, there are a few. We\u2019ll go over three complications next. Read on.\n\n<h2><strong>1. Poison Ivy Complications: Scarring</strong></h2>\n\nWhile none of our upper deque skin cell membranes are permeable enough to absorb poison ivy toxins, it sounds like a lot of us are certainly willing to take the chance.  As much as we hate poison ivy and itch from it, we want to see a little bit of it, and give it a close sniff. We\u2019re curious. Read on.\n\nOften called cell membrane burning, urushiol burning is a self defense mechanism that trees use in an effort to defend themselves from pests.  However, when it\u2019s expelled using wells through blisters or drippage, it\u2019s capable of disabling the autonomic nervous system and causing actual nerve damage. This is harmful to people because the skin is the respiratory system\u2019s primary defense against these vapors. Leaving poison ivy to sit any longer than a month on your skin is more than just annoying--it\u2019s harmful.\n\n Speaking of which, poison ivy\u2019s blistering rash is caused by white blood cells. These are exactly what the doctor ordered during an infection. They kill the bacteria by surrounding it completely, suffocating it into nothing.

My GP prescribed it for me for a week but probably wouldn't again without proper request.

I'm actually convinced that anything that minimizes pain must do so by shutting down the signalling pathways that cause the pain.

I tried 6 weeks of saxenda and lost 7 pounds. I am never going to mess with saxenda again though. I felt awful. I was experiencing lightheadedness, headaches, spaced out, napped a lot, and was agitated. It may work for some, but for me, it was awful. I rather do Keto and burn off fat. For saxenda to work, you have to restrict your calories but you do not need to count carbs or fat. That is what my physician told me when I asked about saxenda.\n\nI still take ozempic (3mg) 1x per week but for me I just want something additional to really dial me in. Encouraged by an actress on Instagram I started Addyi & just received my last prescription - I have it stool but have not started yet. Ozempic makes it difficult to eat too much and keeps me full, calm/a little tired quite often and actually makes me feel more motivated to workout and get stronger. I take a hot oil once a week, usually on my ozempic day, and also take conjugated Estrogen 1x per week, fibre / probiotics and a one a day multi vitamins.\n\nIs ozempic a GLP-1 agonist? I went into a metabolic free fall of 57lb lost between January and July and stopped losing, with conversion to resultant diabetes 2 with HGA1C 6.9. I needed to work out etc or else it would become massive soon, but it was almost a survival thing to lose weight to clear up type 2 and my son is also obese. Was put on ozempic by GP after 6 weeks of no weight loss prior to that. My stckist informed me it is not a GLP-1 agonist, and use of Aptide in tandem might be risky.

Good luck!\nIf it makes you feel better, I have had shoulder pain like this off and on for about 2 years. Most of the time it's dull and aching. Other times it's sharp and stabbing. I've had two different doctors examine it and say there is nothing wrong. Any shoulder exercises I try only aggravate it - I think that's just death to the shoulder with claudication. I have attributed both the wheezing and shoulder pain to end stage Necrosis. When my claudication is mild I can withstand chest exercises and upper body exercises. But lately the pain is so bad (ugh) that nothing seems to work. Physical therapy helps a little but I have to be careful not to overdo it. I feel the same way as the other poster. About 95% of the time, the shoulder pain happens every time I go to inhale. I have been told this is still Tissue Death (I think) and not that I will choke to death or anything like that. The only relief I get comes from a raised PE Tube and Assualt valve (if the tube fits in with my unusual mouth anatomy) which <i>very</i> few people I know have - that is something to ponder in and of itself, it seems to me. Best of luck to you!!\nStrom1234: How long and how drastic is your claudication? An idea where your amounts of exercise tolerance lays? Does OTC medicine helps? I feel like not well rested with my right shoulder, its quite frustrating. It's a low grade of pain that comes and goes. Could be something to be considered for my lung. Sounds the more logical because the pain kinks my breathing. Since when you get right to the edge of your claudication symptoms, it hurts to inhale a deep breath - if that makes any sense. It's nothing like my sci", "In many instances, when a person has injured his or her shoulder, the impact as well as strain causes swelling. In most cases, the impact is near the muscles or tendons in the shoulder area. However, when something happens to the joint or ligament, it affects the bones as well.\n\n<strong>The impact of the injury</strong> depends on the severity as well as the type of injury. There are several types of injuries that result in shoulder pain. You could have torn muscles or tendons, dislocated bones or other types of damage. In many cases, someone who seriously injured the shoulder needs to wear a sling or something similar to keep that arm at rest. The pain might begin in the shoulder but then radiate towards the elbow as well.\n\nSome find that they cannot raise the arm above the chest level due to this injury. Sometimes elbow and shoulder pain while passing requires medical care to repair the damage. Resting for an extended period is an additional means of preventing the swelling to spread to other body areas.\n\nFor those who want to get their blood flowing to restore their body\u2019s natural energy, doing breath-movement exercises are an option. Some even decide to participate in breathing exercises in a seated or standing position. Varying your posture helps with getting the bloodstream flowing better in other body areas that are not affected by the injury.\n\nIn the event that the injury involves damage to the arm joint, the arm may feel as though it\u2019s hurting. The intentional or undesirable arm movement could even lead to making the injured area more painful.\n\nMoving While Breathing and the Pain in Your Shoulder\n\nThe stronger your sense of balance is, the more able you are to stand up straight. Changing your posture can distract you from feeling pain from any other part of your body. When enough of the blood is flowing through the other areas, the shoulder does not retain the same level of pain it does otherwise.\n\nA person may even decide to bend at the knees and assists them in maintaining the right sense of balance. The knee bend can also help keep the back straight while concentrating more on the lower area of the body.   \n\n<strong>Exhale and purge your body of toxins</strong>\n\nPurging your body of the toxins in your body is another way that reducing your stress can help with movement as well as breathing. Inhaling all the necessary oxygen with more movement helps to associate the circulation with the toxins you have in your body.  \n\nSince there are toxins in your body, exhaling them out of your body can boost your body\u2019s circulation.", "I have severe boss on my left shoulder and pain on my right and I have been reading up about meningitis in google and bouring but answered have been vague.

When you\u2019re more proactive about staying hydrated, you help your body regulate temperature, produce energy, eliminate waste, and absorb micronutrients.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are drinking a lot of fluids but your urine remains white or clear, this could be a sign that you have liver disease, diabetes, or kidney disease.\n\nIn some instances, a healthy adult might experience white or clear urine color from consuming diuretics like caffeine, niacin, aspirin, and other medications. This condition, known as leukocystosis, occurs when white blood cells are present in your urine.\n\nYour healthcare provider can check for leukocystosis by performing a urinalysis. In fact, in some instances, having white blood cells in the urine without a fever could mean you have signs of kidney malignancy.\n\nStress usually increases urea in the urine causing a yellow-light color.

You\u2019ll usually have clear urine if you frequently consume water, unless you\u2019re on the brink of severe dehydration. Our bodies might be charged and hydrated thanks to drinking water and limit the (sometimes) weird peeing symptoms.\n\n<h2>Clear Urine Meaning</h2>\n\nUrine is one of the body\u2019s waste products and it leaves the body through the urethra. Urine includes urea, which is formed after the food which we eat is digested by our body into ammonia which is then transformed into urea molecules (Urea is a water-soluble organic compound formed by the condensation of two molecules of ammonia with a molecule of carbon dioxide and is present in plants and animals. It is powerful and pH 8 \u2014 10) in our body.\n\nFoods include nitrogen, which is also a key element in the urease molecule. Nitrogen is also included, including in protein (carbohydrates, lipids, and protein are the three classes of human feed foodstuff). Nitrogen is released after breaking down this food.\n\nThe kidneys and ureters are located near the bladder, and on a normal day, these organs produce approximately 1.5 liters of 95% waste and just 5% beneficial and fantastic fluid completely free of waste age. Therefore, when it is clear, it is because it is more than 95% waste (1).\n\n<h3>Why Urine Should Be See-Through?</h3>\n\nUrine should typically be transparent enough to view without issue. However, your pee can appear lighter or darker depending on what you consume or use in your system. Urine might have a yellow tinge, be an intense yellow, or be transparent.\n\nWhen urine has an abnormal color, it becomes the topic of concern for a lot of people.

If you have recently tried clear liquid for water, you may find that your pee is now clear and colorless. This article is about urine, and we will answer all your questions.\n\n<h2><strong>What is Urine?</strong></h2>\n\n<strong>Urine</strong> is the waste our body\u2019s excretory system eliminates. This liquid is made by excreting unwanted substances like food compounds and inorganic salts. There\u2019s a process, called glomerular filtration, which separates most of the bodily substances from water in blood before it is expelled.\n\nUrine contains another type of protein, called aldosterone, which helps lost water return to the body if there is no water available. Normally, urine has a yellow tint, hence why the color of urine may differ from yellow to clear urine. Those having kidney stones, chronic infections, and other diseases, may have a strong-colored pee like straw.\n\nSo, why isn\u2019t the color of urine always yellow? Due to the absence of ammonia and other compounds that cause color, urine in this case shows no color. Urine remains clear when these compounds are not present in it.\n\n<strong>Clear urine</strong> is achieved when there is no substance in it; hence why most drinks will give how the color of urine eventually.

Actually, I haven't taken either drug yet and I was only planning on taking Zylobria for a week but figured I would be fine switching. I really just want to stop the Cymbalta and once I figured i would be okay I would fill the Zolibria. Today my other doctor phoned me back and said that he is requesting a refill on my Cymbalta although if you read the following, I may take a risk here that will be exposed before its even been a full week. I think the other doctor is being an a$$ and think they are pressuring me which is what I don't want. From my understanding with Cymbalta, I really would like to stop that sooner than later and see how I feel. Would you just say keep the Cymbalta meds, enjoy them for a couple weeks and then move to middle maintenance? I mean if I continue with getting these magic pills from the neuro, my (other) doc might tell the neuro or have me on Cymbalta forever - like I don't need to wean off or switch. I would love a smarter doctor. thanks for your feedback.\nUpdate: To xsorah. I feel like it is a waste to take those pills because they only help mild symptoms. I feel like I have gotten high tolerance over the year I have been taking 2 30mg pills a day (they gave me 60-\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629). It has not decreased symptoms in the past month like it used to. Also, I have totally stopped the 30mg pills because I don't feel I have 14 symptoms like I used only a few months ago, now I actually feel like 2-3 mild symptoms now (old symptoms have gone away). It doesn't help that when I googled i didn't find one website that indicates you will do well while going off this med..but thankfully this one did. I have one good year now without taking Cymbalta and if there's a 2-3 week period where I will have more severe symptoms, I'll survive for a couple weeks. If anyone knows if you can give advice as to what you do to help yourself here I would love it. Will read books or watch youtubes on this, I guess.

I don't have a doc and wouldn't get one tbh. Zinc has helped my sleep and kept me from dropping too quickly since I'm also withdrawing from ativan and Klonopin. Significant tapering has been slower to stave off mini withdrawals or a full blown withdrawal. How long has it been since you got on pull them?\nThe Zoloft will be extremely helpful to you.

You would have to see the numbers of patients we have created (7- 20 plus/day) during the last 18 months. Also, the personnel exhaustion related to increased aspiration is much less. Thanks to B C", "Hi my dear,\nI am new to this site, so I hope I am in the right place. I am almost 2 days past the post op. Of a double SAL and I have seen many people posting their concerns about nausea and it sounds like they are going to throw up any moment and completely shut the gas up and hold it in. I am one of those people who has to drink or eat about every 2 hours or I throw up real bad, and mine is just white just like the water, not greenish from bile. I had all the conditions that required a double and it has been 12 years coming. My last hospital one was caused by a dull ache on my left side from Ke escolar and then 15 days of horrible pain, I visited the ER three times, they kept telling me it was a kidney stone. Eventually it moved itself into my view and they saw it very clearly but still told me it was a kidney stone. They finally admitted I needed an ultrasound and after the ultrasound, to everyone's surprise, it was a large twist. Because I kept drinking to prevent throwing up, it stayed unaffected and I had 6 tablets with Gabiopentin 1200 mgs and the next day was able to go to the OR and it was a 3 hour PIR and then a 4 hour appendectomy. So although I do drink in order to prevent myself from throwing up and not wanting to burst the stitch that is holding my BS close, I really do not want to have a temppaddingTop staff and I been here 2 days and my poop is still in there, and although I do not have a permanent staff, my insides stinks, how am I supposed to poop it out, why is the poop no coming out and will this be urgent like the others oncologists have told me. I am shocked to hear such stories from others who have had both of them done together. I really do not want this to be worse as the others have told me from the removal from the appendix and bag which I may find out tomorrow as it has not been removed yet. Please get back to me about my poop issue I really need to know how other s have dealt with this. Thank you so much Debbie1965a\n<p>i agree i had to have 100mg pain med before anything was able to be done .... </p>\n\nI am 59 years old and was just diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer in the rectum", "For example, could you take Zofran before vomiting started and it prevent the vomiting?\nI know unisom/doxylamine made me nauseous at the time it's given but I could sleep away the nausea after it builds up in your system sometime it helps first trimester.

Or Recostapine worked for me with acid reflux.", "Is there something I can drink or some liquid I could take that will ease nausea? Presently I can only handle ice chips and Jello.\n\nJennster I have only found the ones prescribed medically to be somewhat effective but they also do cause drowsiness. The pepsics and stuff that are over the counter do not work for me. Maybe you could find some home remedies that someone else has used, been thinking of trying apple cider vinegar for when my problems get bad. If I had the choice though to get rid of the nausea I\u2019d take dry mouth over it anyday so maybe the less you can end us taking the happier you\u2019ll be. Good luck trying something out and let me know how it goes.\n\nSorry I forgot to add, vomiting can make you so dehydrated; if that\u2019s the case it won\u2019t be like you will have any appetite even for some of the home remedies. In which case you may need the fluids from the IV\u2019s to balance you again.\n\nPsst: Everyone has a different reaction to nausea meds. What works for one person won\u2019t necessary work for another. And what you can handle one day won\u2019t necessarily remain what you can handle the next.\n\nChewable B6 and B6 Liquid + B12. Granted the nausea at the time I tried them was not from dehydration.\n\n3-4 tablespoons of apple cider vineger. Then try to eat something, like a cracker. Eat the cracker first. Then if you can, drink 1/4 cup Apple Juice with seamless honey. Try that and if you start feeling sick again, try 1/2 tsp activated charcoal. It works like magic:(\n\nGood luck! Baby steps.\n\nevelyn711 is there general protocol to assist you when you\u2019re dehydrated and getting IV\u2019s in at the hospital? because non of the nausea meds did anything to help me when it came to getting any thing inside of me.\n\nYou are dehydrated when you drink the water or pedialite and feel thirtsy again in a short period of time. You are low in water and electrolytes at this time.\n\nIf your feet feel numb and tingly or weak, that is the first sign of dehydration. You also get sticky coldx and no tears. Tilting your head back causes your eyes to dry out because you can\u2019t close your eyes completely because of no tears. This leads to double vision.

This is a great post to mention these symptoms (\"...body hurts, chills, loss of appetite, nausea\") in light of members discussing symptoms of similar viruses. Thank you for sharing your story :)Toppik\n\nI too suffered from bronchitis for 3 years with it turning into pneumonia 2 times. Over and over. Took months and months to heal during those years.\n\nI began yoga in 2009 and I am hardly ever sick when in the past I used to get sick quite often.\n\nI am wondering also if I can choose between a massage and acupuncture. I wonder too if the massage therapist can treat all my muscles and joints instead of just where I had acupuncture in the past? Toppik\n\nAnother recourse I read that can cure chronic bronchitis is spending time in cold temperatures (like swimming in cold water in the ocean, while wearing a wetsuit) to protect the body from the extreme cold. I have no idea whether it works but it's only 99c. Toppik\n\nIn regards to weak immune system:\n\nTake both vitamin D3 (1000 units) and vitamin C (500 mg to 1000 mg). I go for the extended release turmeric PLUS hay fever capsules (at night, maxed out at 100,000 units!) and it REALLY helps. Also make sure you eat tablets with curry (or just eat small amount of curry yourself) at least once a week. My friend had chronic cough for years gone. He often eat curry during winter. Vitamin d3 fish oil extract (1000 units) may improve your immune system as well.

Due to damage or structural changes to the bronchial tubes, children are more susceptible to infection.\n\nBoth infectious and non-infectious bronchitis occur in children. One type of bronchitis that is called bronchitis may look like another respiratory infection. The cough and other symptoms are similar. An upper respiratory infection causes non-infectious <strong>bronchitis</strong>. Non-infectious bronchitis is worldwide among children and adults. It is often caused by a virus.\n\n<strong>Infectious bronchitis</strong> can be spread by respiratory tract secretions, such as coughs and sneezes, or directly from people in contact with an infected person. Coughs, coughs, or colds that can be treated at home do not require treatment from a health care professional unless the symptoms are severe, persistent, or worsening. Most people recover from these symptoms within one to two weeks. But during the period of recovery the inconspicuous sniff can be contagious and may continue to spread to others.\n\n<h3>How To Recognize Bronchitis:</h3>\n\nSymptoms include frequent coughing, fever, chills, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, and headache. In some cases, bronchitis can progress to pneumonia. If the mucus from the sinuses or lungs contains green, yellowish, or brown pus, it should be considered an infection. If a family doctor suspects that the child has bronchitis, he or she will order one or more tests to rule out the possibility of pneumonia.\n\n<h3>Cleansing of the nasal mucosa:</h3>\n\nThe intensive exposure to dust and allergy triggers can be another cause. Medicine to treat asthma and allergies largely influences the respiratory tract immune system, making the bronchial tubes sensitive to coughs and infectious stimuli. Proper allergy and asthma control treatment and monitoring can make allergies less likely to cause mucous membranes.\n\nInfection of the nasal passage is another important cause of airway irritation, which may be in the nose is present in air pollutant emissions and chemical irritants. Pollutants must be removed and retained, which can weaken the mucosal protection and lead to infections of the nasal mucosa.\n\n<h1>Bronchitis Nutrition:Increase Immunity through decent food</h1>\n\nHere the solution of <strong>many brochures and leaflets deals with rashes which is widely diverse in nature, In practice and In treatment.</strong> The implementation of the measures is challenging for health officials and patients.\n\n<h3>Ways to eliminate pollen:</h3>\n\nPollen in powerful breezes can be completely mitigated.

Warm sitz baths after bowel movements can give temporary symptomatic relief. Stool softeners and laxatives can treat constipation, whilst increasing dietary fiber or fiber supplements can prevent hard bowel movements. A topical vasodilator that is applied on or around the fissure, such as topical nifedipine or nitroglycerin, can be prescribed to promote healing. For fissures that fail to respond to initial medical therapy, botulinum toxin A injections into the internal sphincter or surgery (lateral internal sphincterotomy) may indicated.

If you\u2019ve asked yourself any of these questions frequently, then there is a reason. About 3/4 of all adults have at least one episode of gastritis or constipation per year. Why?

The TORAC-01 hose is much larger than the esophagus and the catheter runs from the outside opening in the TORAC-01 all the way down to the lung. It is possible for fluid to back up into the tubing and cause pain and damage but it takes a large amount of fluid, an improper orientation of tubing, clot in the lung or injury to the lining of the lung to do so.\n\nThe reflux guard is a great option for pressure offloading the lungs and relaxing the diaphragm but it does add an extra layer of gasses (carbon dioxide - carbon dioxide is tolerable, but water vapor is much more comfortable and does not require flushing). Removal of the device should be performed in the absence of other treatments as reflux guard devices are removed regularly to verify the location of air leak including enrollment and maintenance in docusate therapy and apnea rates.\n\nIf desired, get a prescription from your diaphragm care specialist for \"no air in the lungs\" mittens for TORAC-01 and sleep without the guard.", "It could be related to cold weather.

I think you should just know I would certainly not come on here and post a question like this.\n\nBad thing is I don\u2019t know your partner.

I also get that anxious feeling that you write about above of either falling asleep and then having wasted a night's sleep or not sleeping at all and answering the question tomorrow without understanding on the day.\n\nAs a direct result of being on OTCs/OCD which award no sleep points, I now go to either Jungian Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (JCBT) groups (once a week) or, more basically, to what we call 'sleep pods', which are essentially sitting with other people talking about nothing specific at all. I think doing both great (especially JCBT), with JCBT especially being helpful about understanding content and process, e.g. why you should or shouldn't sleep not being about substance but about process (e.g. JCBT workshops may encourage silent activities) which can be disturbing but typically only for 3-5 days.\n\nFrom both I have acquired/developed meta-cognitive skills e.g. worrying about other people is first and foremost a manifestation of OCD/Shame, but into which other person/people you worry is at the whims of OC (not change) patterns, and which you have no control over. This, in turn, may mean taking on other people's reactions and responsibilities that belong more to or conflict with your own e.g. JCBT groups can sometimes have the intensity of therapy groups.\n\nIt's also about properly understanding the nature of intrusive thoughts/worry and treating it less as a form of problematic thinking (and correspondingly either trying to supress it or searching for solutions) and more of a form of emotion. Indeed, in JCBT, the theory (ch 1 in The Curriculum of Active Imaginations, Volume 1: One model of clinical training by David Adams) is that while 'Thinking is a form of emotion' it is simultaneously always emotional too. If you go to any JCBT group, you can clearly make the distinction between people thinking and people having emotions, even if you cannot define either as such. This, means that as long as you have the impulse to keep thinking, you also have the impulse to continuously experience emotions, just as long as they are associated, as they are in OCD, with anxiety.\n\n+I'm finding OCD/OCD a great out for those kind of learnt behaviours and screening out", "I just do not seem to be falling asleep and I do not know why.\n\nI prefer to set an alarm clock than sleeping pills because what if I forget to deactivate it and sleep over it?\n\nAlas I do not know why it happens like that.\n\nCan someone help me on understanding about these matters?\n\nHey Claire!\n\nWhich method are you using to fall asleep? Have you ever tried the taper method? Well since we are helping you learning how to use the app, I honestly never thought that Hhoch asked about it when he did vision timer. So, I\u2019m going to tell you about method that worked for me skip to the 6:50 mark.\n\nAt 6:50 he touches on Ambient and Hipnosis Mind Plunger. Since they are all pretty much the same, you want to use things so you can sleep at night it should be a pretty easy decision on what one to use. Since you are experiencing awake most of the night what you want to do is the taper. They also have a batch that you can find on the website. What you want to do is the market that goes from audio perspectives, all the way down to audio sleep. So, there is no audio there and you basically only heard the recording itself. I find this makes falling asleep a lot easier because you are not focusing on do you want to sleep or am I focused on something and suddenly I snap out of it and realize that it\u2019s time for bed and I need to play an audios that will allow me to do that. It\u2019s a mix between cheaply presence taprica of the thought that you\u2019re thinking. But this allows you to feel like you\u2019re actually listening to the audio and not any of the lengthy that\u2019s the first thing.\n\n\u2013 Ambient Maximus\n\n* * Ground Enhancement\n  * Master Modes\n  * Extreme Anchoring\n  * Protean Layers\n  * (Optional) Awareness Calibrator\n\n\u2013 Earth Journeys\n\n* * Ground Enhancement Wave Slopes\n  * Ground Enhancement Carry Forward\n  * Master Modes\n  * Protean Layers\n  * (Optional) Awareness Calibrator\n\n\u2013 Alpha Bukoo\n\n* * Ground Enhancement Wave Slopes\n  * Ground Enhancement Carry Forward\n  * Ground Enhancement AF Synchronisation\n  * Set Up Mode\n  * Archetypes Anchor\n  * All Modes Enhanced\n  * Biome Blending\n  * Protean Layers\n  * (Optional) Awareness Calibrator\n\n\u2013 Audio Sleep"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.0972, "rouge1_r": 0.0156, "rouge1_f1": 0.0269, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0694, "rougel_r": 0.0112, "rougel_f1": 0.0192, "bleurt": 0.4924, "bert_score_p": 0.714, "bert_score_r": 0.7872, "bert_score_f1": 0.7488, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.2778, "rouge1_r": 0.0595, "rouge1_f1": 0.098, "rouge2_p": 0.0423, "rouge2_r": 0.009, "rouge2_f1": 0.0148, "rougel_p": 0.1806, "rougel_r": 0.0387, "rougel_f1": 0.0637, "bleurt": 0.2326, "bert_score_p": 0.7672, "bert_score_r": 0.8079, "bert_score_f1": 0.787, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.2917, "rouge1_r": 0.0597, "rouge1_f1": 0.0991, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1667, "rougel_r": 0.0341, "rougel_f1": 0.0566, "bleurt": 0.2767, "bert_score_p": 0.7834, "bert_score_r": 0.8109, "bert_score_f1": 0.7969, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.2361, "rouge1_r": 0.0746, "rouge1_f1": 0.1133, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1389, "rougel_r": 0.0439, "rougel_f1": 0.0667, "bleurt": 0.231, "bert_score_p": 0.7903, "bert_score_r": 0.8003, "bert_score_f1": 0.7952, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.375, "rouge1_r": 0.0644, "rouge1_f1": 0.11, "rouge2_p": 0.0423, "rouge2_r": 0.0072, "rouge2_f1": 0.0123, "rougel_p": 0.25, "rougel_r": 0.043, "rougel_f1": 0.0733, "bleurt": 0.3006, "bert_score_p": 0.7833, "bert_score_r": 0.8088, "bert_score_f1": 0.7959, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 40.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.2778, "rouge1_r": 0.0528, "rouge1_f1": 0.0887, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1667, "rougel_r": 0.0317, "rougel_f1": 0.0532, "bleurt": 0.2967, "bert_score_p": 0.7761, "bert_score_r": 0.8083, "bert_score_f1": 0.7918, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 20.0}]}

They are familiar to our people and propagation can occur through different ways such as notions or snots, coughs, sneezes and discharges from around the nasal apertures.\n\nIt can also overcome by intolerable changes in the climate and poop yards. Protean heterogeneous traits in our immune system may arise if exposed to foreign pathogens. These factors might change with the stage of the disease and can influence the susceptibility and the response of electrode nose to a particular virus.\n\nFew confined examples are mentioned below\n\n<h2><strong>Is Viral Pharyngitis an Allergy Thing?</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Cytomegalovirus (CMV)</strong></h3>\n\nCytomegaloviruses are members of human beta herpes virus and belong to genera of herpes viruses.

So now I am wondering if his \"flea treatment\" session then fixed the issues he was having with where he was going to his car.\n\nHas anyone else had pets with this problem, meaning urinating over everything except their little box?\n\nI don't think this is a normal behaviour so have tried to figure out what is wrong for the two and a half years I've had him.\n\nI just got home from work and just looked at my cat when she was grooming herself. She has white hair like human flakes and it looks like there are insects moving in there. I used a fine borer on it to see if it is an insect or not and that's how I found out that there is a worm like object inside.\n\nI am freaked out, I am washing my counter tops in bleach and plan to wash and vacuum the whole carpet thoroughly. I am also going to pull the bed out and put bleach all over the floor and walls. I plan to take my cat to the vet tomorrow and have all six of my horses tested for the parasites.\n\nI had a friend tell me infested house furniture should be disposed of because you cannot wash the couch or rugs or curtains thoroughly enough.\n\nOh and by the way, the rugs don't move - these \"bugs\" are moving too much. I can still see white hair flakes although I can't feel the bumps anymore.\n\nLmy cat was vomitting, losing weight, coughing up hair", "He's healthy, seems to lose an ounce every few moths and eats less, but keeps growing and getting bigger. I eat real raw meat, do I have to stop or ______ out the symptoms?\nThey usually don't know, until 12 months or more after they were touched by it.\nYou will probably never get the symptoms unless a cat with the tapeworm spits up the worm and you eat it. No one known for certain this happens. However, the chance of you even getting any worm from a cat is unlikely since your being so cautious about eating meat you no longer eat it uncooked so the chances are they would get cooked so the worms would be dead and no chance at all you would get the tapeworm.\nOh my gosh, what are you eating? :shocker:\nHe already got the deworming shot in the immeadiate future. The vet did more tests after they believed he had tapeworm. IT turns out it was a roundworm .\nThough, I think the chance of getting it from your cat is slim to none, like fluffy said. He would much rather want you to get the tape worm from eating something you shouldn't such as an old egg, a uncooked chicken, blood-raw steak and maybe even like a carton of unopened Creame or Strawberry Milk. He probably would not want you to have it, since you eat so little to keep him fat.\nIf you want to play on the safe side and you're pregnant or know a person who is pregnant then DO NOT come into contact with your cats stool, the cat or the cat litter.\nYou cannot get any of the worms cats are a host to from eating raw meat. They are of human species which you do not eat or have. You can get bacteria from raw meat or anything if you eat it raw.Start looking for the larger target than something you may or may not have and cats.\nI am so sick of what I call the wife knows best article. Read form the cat disease chiller,and food sites cats are carriers and host to many of the worms that dogs are.Many people treat cats for worms too.\nyourett is FULLY aware of roundworms- they cause Feline Vit A poisoning, Roundworm larvae also cause a very painful eye infection called Acanthosis, which can cause blindness, many people perscan cats to avoid roundworms, we can get them, cat sand dog sh liver and mi have roundworms simas, cats can get", "Absolutely not.\nThis is a tad different, because she was recent in pet sitting for a 1 day, and the owner of the dog is a cat owner too, and their cats are not sick in any way. I don't handle cats often, much less off of the ground, so could I have gotten it that way (she infected herself feeding her cat, then I got sick from them both touching)? He is not having any problems, probably because he's just a puppy, but should I be worrying?\nSorry about that. Typo. He's got a persistent cough too.\nI did take care of her dog from about 8-9pm until around 7 in the morning, mainly because she's going out of town for a few days. He's been doing well, no coughing at all, that is until later in the morning, but I haven't touched him until the evening, because I don't live close by so she brought him to me in the morning when she dropped me off before going to class for a while, and we also stopped by the hers home on the way back by, to feed ME his dog. He is an award winning Abyssinian, and anxiety is a common thing with them, and he also gets really anxious for his little sister that he usually hangs out with. I'm taking him over to his pen in my backyard, but he's really good at getting into just about anything in there, so that's my next best option. I obviously can't just keep him inside while I'm healing, so I have to keep a watchful eye on his, because his anxiety is getting ridiculous , plus, he's on medicatioan to counter act this.\nI'm just worried because they are so trusting of me, and I've been back into there home about 3 or 4 times since returning home, and they've been clinging to me more than usual. They've been acting weirdly since about 2 days prior, so me returning home for the next 8 days would only make them more stressed out than usual.", "Or does it have to be a different tapeworm?\n\nDo you mean Spar Ethanol?

Dipylidium caninum, an intestinal tapeworm, is commonly transmitted to people. Typically this worm is contracted when a human ingests an insect, such as a flea or wingless fly, that is infected with the tapeworm's eggs. Therefore, treatment of the cats and dogs that come in contact with infected people and their pets is very important. Cats should have their flees treated, and people are asked to try to prevent the use of any raw or undercooked meats. Hookworms, whipworms, and roundworms are commonly found in cats and can be passed from cats to humans, especially in small children, but the danger of contracting these worms from a cat is very, very low.\n\nWhat sort of distended belly does my cat appear to have? Is it gas?\n\nAny animal's belly that becomes suddenly distended warrants an immediate veterinarian exam. It could be gas, but it could also be related to swallowed hairballs, from trauma or blows to the abdomen, from an obstruction or disease within the intestinal tract or liver, or it could just be something catastrophic. We would need to see the animal and examine him and treat and aid him with many tests, including ultrasounds and blood work, before we could definitely let you know what would work.\n\nMy cat's eyes have changed colour over the last year, and she keeps throwing up white foam. What's wrong with her?\n\nA white-appearing foam being thrown up by a cat indicates some possible gastrointestinal disease. White foams can develope in cats that have intestinal infections, bowel obstructions, cancer, masses and tumours within the bowel, blockage of the bile ducts within the liver (cholestasis), etc. You'll want to have your cat looked at by a veterinarian immediately.\n\nMy cat threw up within 12 hours of eating some cooked chicken. What could cause this reaction? Should I just feed him the raw chicken from now on?\n\nThe cooked food may do the job for your cat, but raw food often seems to be much more potent for cats, and they enjoy it, eat more of it, etc. Most times, this is related to your cat being allergic to something within the chicken. He may have safe chicken now and then but not consistently, or he may have an entr\u00e9e chicken recipe versus some parts he is allergic to in raw chicken.\n\nHow can I gently remove hairballs from my cat's throat?\n\nCats that"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6093, "rouge1_r": 0.2283, "rouge1_f1": 0.3321, "rouge2_p": 0.1867, "rouge2_r": 0.0697, "rouge2_f1": 0.1014, "rougel_p": 0.3576, "rougel_r": 0.134, "rougel_f1": 0.1949, "bleurt": 0.4406, "bert_score_p": 0.8213, "bert_score_r": 0.8578, "bert_score_f1": 0.8392, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5033, "rouge1_r": 0.1708, "rouge1_f1": 0.255, "rouge2_p": 0.08, "rouge2_r": 0.027, "rouge2_f1": 0.0404, "rougel_p": 0.2119, "rougel_r": 0.0719, "rougel_f1": 0.1074, "bleurt": 0.291, "bert_score_p": 0.8031, "bert_score_r": 0.8386, "bert_score_f1": 0.8205, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4768, "rouge1_r": 0.1678, "rouge1_f1": 0.2483, "rouge2_p": 0.0333, "rouge2_r": 0.0117, "rouge2_f1": 0.0173, "rougel_p": 0.2252, "rougel_r": 0.0793, "rougel_f1": 0.1172, "bleurt": 0.2257, "bert_score_p": 0.802, "bert_score_r": 0.8371, "bert_score_f1": 0.8192, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.404, "rouge1_r": 0.1676, "rouge1_f1": 0.2369, "rouge2_p": 0.02, "rouge2_r": 0.0083, "rouge2_f1": 0.0117, "rougel_p": 0.1788, "rougel_r": 0.0742, "rougel_f1": 0.1049, "bleurt": 0.2322, "bert_score_p": 0.7951, "bert_score_r": 0.7999, "bert_score_f1": 0.7975, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3841, "rouge1_r": 0.1398, "rouge1_f1": 0.2049, "rouge2_p": 0.0267, "rouge2_r": 0.0097, "rouge2_f1": 0.0142, "rougel_p": 0.2053, "rougel_r": 0.0747, "rougel_f1": 0.1095, "bleurt": 0.204, "bert_score_p": 0.7805, "bert_score_r": 0.8095, "bert_score_f1": 0.7948, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.596, "rouge1_r": 0.2143, "rouge1_f1": 0.3152, "rouge2_p": 0.1333, "rouge2_r": 0.0477, "rouge2_f1": 0.0703, "rougel_p": 0.3245, "rougel_r": 0.1167, "rougel_f1": 0.1716, "bleurt": 0.2931, "bert_score_p": 0.8209, "bert_score_r": 0.8824, "bert_score_f1": 0.8506, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}]}

Another option to reduce these symptoms is to take the drugs with other drugs that reduce stomach irritation, like a proton pump inhibitor such as Omeprazole (Losec, Prilosec) and Esomeprazole (Nexium). If the drug you are using is not well tolerated, it is possible to try to use a different medication such as an enteric-coated NSAID, a more selective NSAID such as Celecoxib (Celebrex), or a different pain and fever reliever such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol).

It's not a coincidence your first symptoms from AI came from there.\n\nI know AI, Headache, Tired all in one ride...and quite debilitating. It's not fun dealing with all that at the same time, Esp. the acid reflux. Eventually the AI and fatigue eventually eases up, even the headache.\n\nThe AI for me now seems to come and go, after 3 years, it seems its more well behaved during the later part of the day. I can now deal with it. (I still have a headache and fatigue when I wake up in the morning, but the AI doesn't seem to kick in until after 10 am) I avoid medicine when it hits, not worth the risk to me. Acid reflux comes and goes from day to day, the most important thing to do with that is limit alcohol consumption, which I cannot do. You might want to avoid milk and minimize carbs to help that.

{"Question": "Ok I will do the blood pressure checks, how often?", "Free_form_answer": "The frequency at which you should measure your blood pressure depends on various factors such as age and medical conditions, and it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider.

I read on cfif.com that the parasite infestations are highly variable, this may be because of the differing stages of life.

Did a few antibiotics like tetracycline had some results felt briefly better normal intial flush died down. gave time for those to cycle out I havnt taken antibiotics all month, but have checked after eating school lunches. This wasnt a widespread epidemic, pretty typical of an old site that I had missed and restarted in the past. I took a good 20 flushes with the HWBS system on and 2-3 after getting a notice and having no digestive symptoms after I did I took some longala and that kept it at bay for a while. Well it started irratating the old sore area nearby. I couldn\u2019t find any surface sickness at this point just a large swollen bottom jaw. Took hottentots, and Hong Kong I can go into more detail on everything I have taken but i won\u2019t go into detail unless neededTill we can come up with a good plan of attack I really just want to build my immune system up and and effect healing and repair.Epi 4 is kinda thick and sticky no significant garlic smell can\u2019t see much besides an obvious onion smell on the parasite side, this is after a few hours, want to call ahead on this sample as well.

I have not been in the hospital seeking medication related problems but in my email I explain to her why Im doing what Im doing and also my worries regarding blood pressure and it being high when I left hospital and I needed to investigate even further and that my health and well-being is my number priority and I really need her to take this seriously as even after I left hospital and started seeing a second community nurse she seemed to keep brushing me off as that is what you do in this community team you need a doctor's supervision. so I googled this beforehand before emailing the GP to ask for GP's help but their hands are tied as well. Its extremely frustrating and delatation with health and mental health teams are so shocking and ridiculous not being taken seriously .\n\nRight I just googled the side effects of the medication and it doesn\u2019t mention any of the symptoms I\u2019m experiencing on the leaflet but has a series of questionnaires to answer but I have had similar experiences when I walked away from previous psychiatric meds. are the side effects delayed on certain drugs? im still in the first two weeks and the doctor is on half dose at the moment. the woman giving me titration didn\u2019t know if the nurse could give me a blood pressure check either she said she will ask so I said to the reception in the hospital to have it done because at the moment I\u2019m in limbo with no doctor as the nurse who is doing my titration was on holidays and the new nurse who is suppose to be doing it now off sick and the other lead nurse that\u2019s in charge of our Psychiatry department who runs it so to speak also off sick. so I\u2019m like I\u2019m lost kung fu when it comes to these type of situation\u2019s when I\u2019m the one that\u2019s suffering and it\u2019s not being taken seriously at all.

Such a powerful drug and stimulator, my guess is it would also wreak absolute havoc on the forebrain via some neurotransmitters injury to ADS or any period of hypoxia.\n\nRegarding blood pressure, when I had **very over-active** (i.e. psychopharmacological treatments) ADHD, my blood pressure was ALWAYS low and borderline.

It has been my presumption in the past that effortful concentration for extended periods in conjunction with various NE drugs, especially in elderly dementia populations, would be a lot more direct red flags for NO metabolites damaging the hippocampus.\n\nIt was also only a matter of time that people who took their NE up took themselves into extinction with prolonged NO synthesis for longer than they can support the amortization of NO to mononitric oxide to nitrite to nitrate converter.

The pinna is the visible part of the ear that is made up of cartilage and skin. The ear canal is the tube that connects the pinna to the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear. The middle ear is the space behind the eardrum that contains the three tiny bones of the ear (the hammer, anvil, and stirrup) and the eustachian tube. The inner ear is the part of the ear that contains the cochlea, which is the organ of hearing, and the vestibular system, which is the organ of balance.\n\nThe outer ear is the part of the ear that is most likely to be infected. Outer ear infections, also known as swimmer's ear, are caused by bacteria or fungi that enter the ear canal through the ear canal. The symptoms of an outer ear infection include pain, itching, redness, and swelling of the ear canal, as well as a discharge from the ear. The loss of hearing is a common symptom of an outer ear infection, as the infection can cause the eardrum to become inflamed and swollen, which can block the sound waves from reaching the inner ear.\n\nThe inner ear is less likely to be infected, as it is protected by the eardrum and the middle ear. Inner ear infections, also known as labyrinthitis, are caused by a viral or bacterial infection that affects the inner ear. The symptoms of an inner ear infection include dizziness, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, as well as a loss of balance and coordination. The loss of hearing is not a common symptom of an inner ear infection, as the infection does not usually affect the cochlea, which is the organ of hearing.\n\nIn conclusion, the loss of hearing is more consistent with an outer ear infection than an inner ear infection. If you are experiencing a loss of hearing, it is important to see a doctor to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.", "It can be ear canal infection or wax. on the other hand, it can be tinnitus also similar symptoms. phonetic-atus as u pullently put from outer ear part.

Unfortunately, you are experiencing the typical gastrointestinal side effects of the Lyrica. Millions of people suffer from the same, including myself. If your pharmacist suggested loratadine, he or she is mistaken. This medication is an antihistamine and does nothing for gastrointestinal distress. I guess s/he didn't take your last name seriously when advising you! Maybe the combination of the Lyrica and Adliant are causing you to feel so lousy. You may want to talk with your doctor about switching you to a different medication.

I also have suggested games from petition forums, when theirs weren't present.I really hope you're on the ball from now on.

Perhaps they got broken up according to some rule? Or were they taken from the queue - I don't remember queueing before.It might be, as said, that if some games got broken in halfway, some people have going or not going, but I sure as hell don't want some games removed from the list or that way i end up on the wrong day. I don't care if you do the work, but just because of this you are removing entire games from the list and merging lists? Err - I'm going to ask: Could you pretty please be consistent from here on? And when you're doing high state duty things that take so much time, do it only on that state game night. And as gifts go - seriously guys, don't make your own rules about minimum ranking. All ranks get gifts. What if you don't like the person ranking up, are you going to give them nothing? How do you plan on implementing a system that you're enforcing a minimum rank?

I know a person in reality a physicians assistant who gave herself prednisone for several weeks while looking for a real diagnosis and found that she had Hashimoto's when the prednisone was no longer of benefit. SO what I'm trying to understand now is what different hormones and when to give them after you are suffering from adrenal fatigue (after you finally figure out your disease and are treating the source whether it's sickle cell anemia, Hashimoto's, Sjorgrens, arthritis, chronic fatigue etc). SO should you and try to repair the adrenal glands first then go through this as an emergency measure in case there is a period where you need to recover fast before fixing the original disease? What I'm trying to understand is what is the one really look like. Do you wait a period of time and then you immediately start addressing both the underlying source and if needed hormones such as cortisol/pregnenolone. Because one question I've never seen in health literature is...say you were diagnosed with a disease for years that causes adrenal fatigue and leakage of cortisol/stress hormones into circulation. You then get the disease under control and want to have a child are you going to be tested to see if there is a phase you would need to go through of artificial hormone replacement or do you need to work on the original disease basically but not let yourself let it go and always take care of the original disease really to a higher degree than most people do. I don't know if we have to pick through the damage in a slow period-like a person diagnosed with arthritis suffers for decades or if their is a definite recovery strategy that can be done and then you are free of what is doomed to tail of with regular disease. I'll tell you of this person I know, after being on prednisone she says I slept better than I ever have, my hair is the best it's ever been, but he was in sky walking best shape of her life when she started the pre.

Ringworm is a fungal infection (and most exist on our hair, skin and nails).  It spreads easily from one location to another and from human to human. \nWith a fungal infection, depending on the type, you wont always feel it.  There is a type where there are no outward signs except for what looks to be a ghost image, usually felt when you touch that spot.\nRingworm on the arms most likely wont itch, but on the face and around head will itch terribly, but it can be shaved/cut without problem.  Ringworm will cut easier on the face than it would on the tops of the arms or other body parts because of the hair laydown in that area.\nTry some tea-tree oil (it comes in gel, cream with applicator) and rub that on each of you after doing the shower method.  Tea-tree oil can kill the fungus.  Sometimes, again depending on where you are getting an infection, the fungus is stronger than the oven and shower method.  And it can still grow even with the killing of the fungus.  Then a stronger medicine, sometimes given by your vet, will help you to get over the infection.  Also, I am not sure about your current one, but some types will not pass easily from one area back to another area once its been shaved off and cleaned.  It sounds as if you are talking about a type though that will come back throughout the month or so.\nHopefully, you havent come into contact with me and my doggy hair (non-shedding, so there must be a pile in your pool area!)

Typically, when referring to Flonase, people talk about the nasal spray containing the active ingredient Fluticasone.

It's for protecting the facial nerve, which is very small and passes under the bone. The jawbone itself takes about 4 months to heal properly. If there's a pool or a suture some of us might get lucky and walk away without a residual- others might need it seen to- it depends on the individual. I've had no residals and various circumstances to thank for this, nothing I could give a definitive reason for.\n\nI really did try and stay off the forum and not get anxious about the for 4 weeks, because I know from experience (and the needle biopsies) how much not moving around for 4-6 weeks can slow down the healing process, not just externally but internally. My nose is ridiculously red and inflamed, it needs the stain for cryosurgery and until it calms down is taking forever to heal.

If the child responds positively to the singulair I think you could perhaps reduce the number of doses depending on if it is causing increased sedation for the client, but the directions for singulair says to take once daily. I worked in a HEPA unit for a while and we would often AMA (short for only allowing what was medically necessary, a legally binding do not order concept) mostly allergic cleansers as well as sedatives like fentanyl until we were at least 72 hours post op. if this is a new issue for your client, ya it sucks, but I would say IME it would be healthier for her overall especiallyavaoid cleanings as a p\u900f\u660e\u514b\u54c9d long term patient. I completely understand every child/client being different., but our ward of 68 beds only allowed less than 10 patients at the complete opposite end of the spectrum of severe allergies to the point of the need of a metered dose inhaler! and even there, we still only allowed our harshest over the counter nasal and skin cleansers as part of the cleaning routine. HEPA rooms are filtered rooms with special ventilation cleanings so anyone who comes into the patient rooms including nurses and specialists ours are always alert and wearing three types of protective clothing to include an airtight sealed mask/breathing apparatus, full body hazburn suit foam protective clothing and shoe coverings. If your visitor wears a TRUE HEPA mask, there would be at least some sort of protection being provided. Not a lot, but at least some. The other comment I would note is sometimes if we had a confirmed case infection like whooping cough, even after lacto Exists antibiotic treatment ended, it would take up to 30 days post diagnosis to be considered officially \"free\" of it. What I would say here is to investigate how their treatment made sure to obtain clearance of this infection if that is the case. Especially if they have clear bilateral productive cough, sounds like excess mucus build up, along our a plethora of other symptoms. Hope that helps.", "Have you though of diprivan? The only thing you can do is keep trying to get your DH to weight. They should and probably will do the test at the doctors office and ideally give him a lipid lift up iv (administered at an outpatient center). Wish you luck and would love and update when you get the results.\n\nThis is a strategy that is clearly viewed as clutching at straws, but I'm going to suggest it as I did have some success with it a year ago:\n\nWhat if you blocked your nostrils with bandaids for the blood draw? (I'm not about to imply this is a sure thing, but I can attest to the experience of having those allergies push everything inside up to your nose and stuff it up so much you can't even budge it around to breath, let alone blood draw. soooo... bandaid block braided string snot straws were used and it worked - no ideh if the bandaids alone would've been enough.)\n\nSorry to hear your DH is struggling with being overweight. It's a tough situation given the health benefits of weight loss. I wish you the best and plenty of snot straws to borrow if they are needed for the liver function test.\n\nHi Cathy,\n\nMy DH's liver function test was borderline with his consultant saying he \"won't let him have ICSI unless they are within a certain level.\" Crohns UK have issued a 'new treatment guideline for adults with Crohn's Disease'. My DH was referred to an endocrinologist (hormone specialist) who agreed with the consultant I had previously only seen to say the test can cause stress. She stressed only insulin open mouth drinks over the testing time period.\n\nHope your DH can get with in the healthier range very soon for you.\n\nthanks guys. we're not bothered about the grade in and of itself because it is very likely that the problem is not effect weight (). not all weight is stored in the abdominal area... he's got a fairly athletic build and very very little around his mid-section. he has a very fair percentage of muscle on him and right now muscle density is the goal. we're also very aware of all the other problems caused by losing weight or bariatric surgery (sleep apnea amongst other things).\n\nis the other alternative i can i, as in ask for a different something or other?", "I have had the singulair for asthma and did not much relief from it. How long does it take to work and to what extent will it work. There are so many inhalers to choose from and nothing ever seems to work for me. I will see my doctor today and discuss some mpds with her without turning to advair as it is a steroid and with this diagnosis I am aiming at keeping steroid meds off. The pulmicort is great for what you want to use it for... you usually have to be on it continuously to \"get a good effect.\" But again, steroid-based. I have been on azmacort for years, and it works pretty well for me. Been on Advair a year because of my pulmonary function, and it is helping a lot. I have used albuterol pretty much every day, good for an immediate affect, if and when needed. My doctor today wants to try montelukast...not sure if it is a steroid based or not...i will start that tomorrow, tx4the info! I will be a fan/reader more often!\n\nHi Robin,\n\nSending you lots of positive thoughts and energy on Tuesday. My prognosis is mostly positive. At this point, the Resmed AirSense G and ResMed Air Touch Masks are my choice. ResMed is the leading company for OSA...they originated the CPAP methods. Once you decide what suits you, you*most* likely won't need to take the pills. I have been perfectly at ease sleeping with the mask. We even just got back from a two week trip to France and Italy...the machine is a bit bulky, but I brought it in the checked bag and then used it wherever we were...even with the crowds enjoying nights out in Venice and Florence.\n\nMy EPICPA Industries (based in Benicia, CA) is also a key OSA company for those who want a maskless, mouthpiece approach...with up to six mouth electrodes to monitor 36 parameters from nose, mouth, and tongue. Have a look, but first decide whether total mask avoidance or a CPAP method is for you:\n\nIf you need CPAP supplies, they have ACE sister website if I recall: (*I suggest the bi-interface air touch mask (a pillow to go under your nose):\n\nPlanning to travel to Nevada, Santa Barbara, or even Nevada? See demo sessions:\n\nWhen you contact the sales rep for EPICPA, tell them Verne sent you.\n\nAlso, note the many comments", "I know it is possible to use together but I'm not sure what you mean exactly.\n\nYes it's an oral tablet I was just talking about being able to use them in conjunction. I guess I'll return the trial of spiriva hopeful that I'll be able to get samera as I understand it to be.\n\nSadly acc to this:\n\nhttp://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/asthma/resources-asthma/clinical-recommendations/pre-treatments\n\nthere is a hierarchy of what 'works best' and it's very definitely Singulair then about a half dozen others\n\nMy wife was on Singular for a couple of decades prior to switching. I believe the newer Spironva inhaler is supposed to be a replacement ( krok.com - 11/18 was our first time using it, so I can't attest to it yet ) ;).\n\nDiane, I appreciate the link. Would you mind elaborating some on what you used to address the side effects and how bad was your asthma concomitant those side effects? I have currently have mild asthma and I'm trying to avoid an inhaler if I can.\n\nI'm not too keen on switching because I certainly do not want to be plagued with side effects that may equal, possibly worse, the avoidance of an inhaler.\n\nI'm trying the Spiriva myself. i've been on Singular for years with no side effects. It is for long term prevention and anti-inflammatory, not to prevent an asthma attack because it is really a reaction, not an inflammation. My allergist insisted on trying Spiriva as she said it offered more long term benefits and control over inflammatory vs antihistamine/short term benefit.\n\nI fear much of her suggestions is driven by sales commission so we shall see!\n\nI took Singulair for a few years as well. It is a great drug, but you get use to theooooooooooomicyswizardiryspeak you have to use when you are done with the pill from swallowing it impractical oral route to nose for following users/nurses.\n\nI started fantaziell on Spinair about a year ago\n\nno improvement noted\n\nWell this is what I have so far... Basically Spivirra had no effect on lung and chest response yet Singulair made things worse. I feel like near the next thing I try for asthma treatment will certainly be Flonase.", "Otc?\n\nThanx\nYes it works, i have used it for a little over 1 -2 years, dose now 4 pills a day for a little while, then i dropped down to just 2 for few months and now i am down to 1 pill a day and i feel thene almost no side effects, except when i start getting that feeling again, i start to itch all over my face( cheeks, jawline everywhere) then i know it is the sign of asthma i dont have to blow into a machine to find out..so this singular works for both, if i take vitamins that i wish not to take, singulair will xel out that ventomoelin or inhailer watever and wont let me breathe better.. Singulair clogs the muscles, not allowing our lungs to exhale for longer periods of time letting us breathes this way for a while, and then it will allow the lungs to breath expell the asthma medication and let it stop unless you do another inhaler (rescuue). I actually have not had any side effects at all w/ singulair,i have been off my rescuuing for a year now even my allergist agrees and my pcp doc, and my primary care.\nSingle is the best thing in the world for asthma. It is awesome. My daugher takes 1 every day and she has not had a respiratory critcal since.\nYes singulair slows down mucus production in the lung making them work. It does not shrink the lung. And no it does not shrink the size of the lung.\nanyone know any OTC alternatives to singulair?\nI tried just taking a breath when I had a panic attack and then I went to the doctor for a solution I went on singulair but just recently had a hysterectomy so I'm wondering if that could have any possible interaction; I have NOT noticed any problems with Singulair , can you take it with vitamins? vitamins like turmeric and fish o phosphorus could inhibit it or decrease the dosage?\n\nDobyo Please!\nI have recently been diagnosed with asthma (allergic asthma). My insurance does not cover the medicines docs prescribed. Have not had symptoms since mid 1990s. Any OTC medicines that I can take for the allergies or samples I can beg at the doc's office that you guys can recommend?

It is readily available for the growing feet.\n\nIt is for this reason that I recommend that you protect your feet from foul weather by keeping them dry. But if you insist that conditions such as diabetes, poor circulation, incontinence, and poor\n\n As a result of the bacteria are responsible for the development of athlete's foot like all infections, they are very similar to certain cancers in that they breed by means of spreading their DNA and eventually destroying the body's ability to heal itself.\n\nIt is therefore ironic that new technology and methods of treatment are currently working up to a revolutionary cure for such health-related causes and are just deaths away.\n\nThe most popular way to avoid these exposure to bacteria is to take your shoes off. That's a great way to get rid of athlete feet. For good. It takes a while but it will definitely work. If you continue to wear your shoes, they will inevitably come back. No method is 100% good at removing bacterial infections.

No, of course it is not possible to transmit a yeast infection. The yeast bacteria (the Lactobacillus and Candida) cannot be transmitted from one person to another. The current epidemic is simply the consequence of American and Western excesses. Women who go to extreme lengths to have a perfect belly with various diets, unhealthy food choices, medications, synthetic clothing, intimate hygiene without water, hormonal treatments, and so on\u2026it is likely to lead to an overgrowth of these bacteria (Candida) because a shift has occurred in the intestinal flora. These excess bacteria (called osteoporosis) when they proliferate can cause pathogenic manifestations in women (dermatosis, talar dermatitis, intimate maceration) which can cause itching, irritation, burning or redness. All of these overgrowths occur when the overgrowth is at their initial phase, there are clearly very minor manifestations by the patient that often do not recognize it. They experience mild symptoms and intimidate themselves by thinking that there\u2019s a complicated more serious disease. In reality this is the classic \u201cignorance of the yeast infection\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d that leads to unnecessary interventions. A person should never question their symptoms or be fearful when they are mild or when they are absent. This will create unnecessary proliferation and overgrowth. These uninhibited solutions often lead to very serious consequences which can become recurrent and then become chronic. Today it is necessary to understand how to avoid any risk of complication. It is essential to understand that medication is not automatically the best way to prevent the onset of complications or the multiplication of bacteria with the excessive use of \u201canti-fungal agents,\u201d parabens, steroids, and intolerance products on the skin. If we were to go through all of the misinformation and evaluations done by dermatologists on symptomatic patients, we would be surprised to learn that 90 percent of all the cases were actually caused by patients. They were victims of misinformation obtained from increasingly perfect through the use of the Internet websites and doctors who do not know how to put these patients at ease or give them the right advice. They would not have to be the product of fear. It is important to abide right now, with good practices. 6 SPECIFIC PRACTICES: \u2013 prefer cotton panties with a very large crock such as the thong \u2013 ensure proper hydration of the skin during any unwanted bathing \u2013 avoid the use of any soap or perfumed fabric and chemical products on the skin \u2013 do not subject yourself to synthetic clothing or synthetic sheets-sheets \u2013 start exercising \u2013 and", "I have the exact same thing.

I have 27-year-old twins \u2014 fraternal boys, 6\u20194\u2033, 220 pounds, great shape. To describe John: He absolutely had high-school hero syndrome; he excelled at drawing, physical fitness, playing Frisbee with his friends, academics, girls. He was extremely insane self-confident; he was great at focusing on one desire at a time. He\u2019s always had that mentality: He has a bargain, he executes it, that is. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s working on Chivas, his car, kicking in the workplace, or being involved in an activity, when he sets a vogue he\u2019s successful.\n\nJamie on the other hand is not extremely high-school hero; he is not a major focus man. He\u2019s very goal-oriented, but his goals are not extremely complex. He\u2019s never been that common-studious, but he\u2019s smart. He had a difficult time in high-school, attempting to match up to his twin but loved sports: band, on the third row, mostly a motormouth guy.\n\nThey have different temperaments, you always see them fighting when they\u2019re both in the same area, like milk off of the same straw; one does bother the other. Chadd became deeply involved when he\u2019d no little desire to, and Jamie\u2019d offer him a hard time.\n\nJamie never quit with a job although Chadd was extremely goal oriented. Now Jamie is 30 years old, getting his BS degree as a media arts. At 32 years old, Chadd finished BS in biology at E.C., and getting a Ph.D. in genetics @ Y.PLACE. Chadd had an extreme work ethic and is extremely intelligent. Unfortunately, Chadd is gone, effectively AND truly.\n\nTo try and put this drug drama into words; Chadd is trapped in the body of a kid: He couldn\u2019t reason his way out of such a pedal, yet Jamie could. Chadd got tired of being one-timed up by life, just getting all the Big picture\u2019and a kilo of cocaine and wrapper came with it\u2026a kilo of heroin instead. The Heroin really became the first drug I\u2019ve seen him wrap himself around. From time for that coke. But he couldn\u2019t break it.

Choose a clean, safe place, such as the coffee table in front of the TV that attracts flies. \n\n3. Hold the skewer steadily with your nose pliers and push it deep into the ear canal. \n\n4. Remove the ear wax deposit by applying pressure on the bottom of the skewer and twisting toward the top to break up the deposit.\n\n5. No matter how far the tube goes, you should find your ear buds touching the back of your ear; make sure that you are removing wax and not just debris in a blocked tube.\n\n6. At this point you may hear an awful clanging noise!  I would suggest setting your wooden skewer aside and getting out a brand new surgical glove. \n\n7.

With your nose pliers grip the bulb, inject the bulb into the canal to ensure you are not holding it too firmly. \n\n8.  Now, you can squeeze the bulb plug between your thumb and index finger. \n\nMY SUGGESTION:\n\nPlace the bulb at a slight angle, near the origin of the insertion point of the skin. \n\n push down on the bulb with one hand by placing your thumb and forefinger in opposite directions for maximum thrust. \n\n9.  The actual bulb infection is simple.  When squeezing the bulb, you should have a little plastic tornado moving in the center of the bulb.  The earwax is immediately cleaned out with a tiny digression of pure, clean air. \n\n10.  For instance, if you have a bright blue bulb, you want to insert the bulb blue side up.  Similarly, if you have a black bulb you want to insert the bulb perpendicular to the wall or whatever is blocking the pipe.  Remember that if you actually have a black bulb it will explode!\n\n11.  The bulb infection can be terrifying, since the infection is unbounded, meaning the infection is not discrete in the sense that it either does or does not exist.  Moreover, with a bulb infection you never know when the infection will rotate or blow out a sealed cavity.  But this is where proper training comes into play.\n\n12.

I guess that is important, but I know there are lots of changes and even just because he is a celebrity, doesn't mean he can't be classed as excellent and kind of, people.\n\nWhat should I do about it? I know the children have sold the car and these people have money. I was waiting to see it. If the family cares, Will they do a fountain and there for a friend and their birthday like a month ago? What about where is the family? I hope they don't give him a big dress, I know it will cost but I want him to have it- I am going to use my own money.\n\nMy family has made some changes.

HPV is a type of virus that infects the skin and mucous membranes. There are many strains of HPV, and some specific strains cause genital warts.\n\nGenital warts develop on the genitals and in the anal or mouth areas. Certain strains of HPV can also cause genital cancer.\n\nHPV is transmitted through sexual contact, so it is more common in people who are sexually active. However, HPV can be transmitted through oral or anal sex, as well as through douching and other personal hygiene activities.\n\nHPV can affect both men and women, but a majority of people will not know they have it, as they will not see any symptoms. It will typically go away on its own, but this only happens in about half of cases.\n\nFinding the wart using a mirror or in the shower can make it easier for your healthcare provider to see during your appointment.\n\nOther conditions that cause warts\n\nOther than HPV-associated genital warts, here are some questions to help determine whether the growth is a wart or something else:\n\n* Does the growth bleed under pressure? If so, it could be a polyp.\n* Is it shiny? If so, it could be a lipoma.\n* Can you see muscle underneath? If so, it could be a lipoma.\n* Does the bump disappear when put under extreme pressure? If so, it could be a sebaceous cyst.\n\nSymptoms of genital warts\n\nGenital warts usually appear as tiny skin growths or bumps that can grow in clusters. They tend to be soft and tag-like, and you can find them around the vagina, vulva, penis, or anus. They are most commonly red or yellowish.\n\n<blockquote><strong>Had a wart removed?</strong>\n\nDid you have warts removed in the past? Tell your doctor if you had the human papilloma virus (HPV), genital herpes, or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-I). A history of other warts can be indicators of the underlying cause of your genital warts.</blockquote>\n\nAs some strains of HPV that cause warts are linked to cervical cancer, it\u2019s best to have symptoms examined by a healthcare provider.\n\nWhy you shouldn\u2019t ignore genital warts\n\nAround 75 percent of people will develop mild or no symptoms from HPV. This means that many people may not notice that they have genital warts or know that they have an STD. Ignoring warts can cause other complications.\n\nFinding treatment can be difficult", "What areas of the body are typically affected?\n<b>Genital warts</b> is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Genital warts can spread throughout the body and organs, complicate pregnancy, and cause cancer. Genital warts (warts, molluscum contagiosum) \u2013 are usually small reddish growths on the genitals, anus, rectum, tongue.\nIf not removed on time, warts can deform the genitalia, bulge the genitals, deform the anus, appear on the genitals of both men and women. When warts grow and clump together, they can block the flow of urine and semen. So the similarity between genitourinary warts and sexually transmitted cancers and AIDS have a lot in common.\nThe average age of dermatological patients with syphilis ranges from 20 to 30 years old, in 15-30 years old the average age of patients with genital syphilis is from 20-25 years old.

Use a condom every time you have sex. If you don\u2019t, both HPV and genital warts can spread with skin-to-skin contact.\n* Get the HPV vaccination.

It\u2019s made up of seven vertebrae, which are the bones that make up the spine.\n\nThe cervical spine is responsible for supporting the head and neck and allowing for movement of the head and neck. It also protects the spinal cord, which is a bundle of nerves that runs from the brain to the rest of the body.\n\nThe spinal cord is surrounded by a protective layer of tissue called the meninges. The meninges are made up of three layers: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater.\n\nThe dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges and is made up of tough, fibrous tissue. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges and is made up of a thin, delicate membrane. The pia mater is the innermost layer of the meninges and is made up of a thin, delicate membrane that closely adheres to the spinal cord.\n\nThe spinal cord is also surrounded by a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF provides cushioning and protection for the spinal cord and helps to regulate the pressure within the spinal canal.\n\nThe cervical spine is also home to a number of nerves that branch off from the spinal cord and travel to different parts of the body. These nerves are responsible for transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\nWhen a nerve in the cervical spine is compressed or irritated, it can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the neck, shoulders, arms, and hands. This is known as cervical radiculopathy.\n\nThe most common cause of cervical radiculopathy is a herniated disc. A herniated disc occurs when the soft, gel-like center of a spinal disc pushes out through a tear in the outer, tougher layer of the disc. This can put pressure on the nearby nerves, causing pain and other symptoms.\n\nOther causes of cervical radiculopathy include:\n\n* degenerative disc disease\n* spinal stenosis\n* osteoarthritis\n* trauma, such as a car accident or fall\n* tumors\n* infections\n* inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis\n\nSymptoms of cervical radiculopathy\n\nThe symptoms of cervical radiculopathy can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the specific nerve that is affected.\n\nCommon symptoms of cervical radiculopathy include:\n\n* pain in", "Neck pain and injury, also called cervical radiculopathy, helps explain also what causes neck pain and symptoms, including shoulder pain and weakness.\n\nTL;DR here\u2019s what we talked about:\n\n* Causes of neck pain\n* Cervicogenic headaches can be painful\n* Regenerative nerve and spine procedures explained\n\nCervical radiculopathy is the certain pathway of nerve roots coming out of the spine. Radiculopathy is pinched or intermingled between the muscles and joints of the spine causing the signals to get jumbled up.\n\nAnd for a Long time cervical radiculopathy, it was thought that it was involved with neck pain from bulging discs, bone spur formation, facet arthropathy, and even arthritis.", "Cervical radiculopathy occurs when your spinal nerves in your neck are pinched or irritated. The condition can cause neck and arm pain or weakness and tingling all the way down to your fingertips. \n\nNeck pain alone is incredibly common, affecting more than 70% of people at least once in their lifetime.\n\nThere\u2019s no exact number for how many people are currently affected by cervical radiculopathy because the condition is often undiagnosed, according to the American College of Radiology. Many of those affected simple don\u2019t receive the proper diagnosis for their more severe symptoms (such as numbness or weakness in the limbs), or the condition gets mistaken for a herniated disc.\n\nMost cases of cervical radiculopathy are treatable; however, the real issue with the condition is the fact that it\u2019s a major risk factor for cervical spinal surgery.  Of the 41% of Americans who reported in the CDC\u2019s 2019 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report that they are getting treatments for their chronic pain, nearly 12% reported pre-op treatment for neck pain to prepare for surgery. If you have cervical radiculopathy and don\u2019t already have surgery scheduled for the condition, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be paying multiple visits to your doctor over the coming months or years in your search for relief.\n\nThe good news is that there are many innovative, effective treatments for cervical radiculopathy, and getting a specific diagnosis for your condition will allow you talk with your doctor about the best course of treatment.\n\nHow is cervical radiculopathy diagnosed?\n\nTo ensure you\u2019re receiving proper treatment, your doctor will need to give a definitive diagnosis.\n\nAt Cyaxares Medical Group (CLMA) our doctors utilize the most advanced imaging modality on the market today, CT-guided pectoromanipulation, also known as PMERC, as well as MRIs and X-rays.\n\nThis encourages the vertebrae to return to a more normal position in the spine. The goal of the injections is to reduce the pain and inflammation associated with the adhesions.\n\nOnce your diagnosis is established, the entire Cyaxares Medical Group medical staff is ready to assist you by going over all of your treatment options, from intravenous infusions and minimally-invasive surgical procedures to chiropractic care and reflexology.\n\nWe also offer Botox for the short-term treatment of biomechanical neck pain along with chronic headaches. Botox injections are intended to decrease muscle activity by blocking pain signals from the nerve endings", "Cervical radiculopathy is a condition characterized by a pinched nerve in the neck caused by wear and tear related with the spinal disc and prolonged sitting, like while driving and also underlying degenerative disc disease. It basically manifests with neck pain radiating to the shoulders, arm numbness and tingling.

Among these, cervical radiculopathies are generally disregarded. Neuropathy, when combined with cervical radiculopathy, can result in debilitating symptoms that are difficult to manage. A condition known as carpal tunnel syndrome is also linked to diabetic muscular dysfunctions linked with cervical radiculopathy. Nerve dysfunction is linked to poor vision and strong distal pulses.An unhealthy lifestyle is also a significant risk factor for cervical radiculopathy.\n\nHigh cholesterol and cervical radiculopathy: High cholesterol is linked to CVA. They are linked to increasing the threat of having cervical radiculopathy. Furthermore, smoking, an unhealthy diet that decreases good cholesterol (HDL) whilst increasing bad cholesterol (LDL), and an inactive lifestyle all increase the risk of cervical radiculopathy.\n\nObesity<strong><b> </b></strong>and cervical radiculopathy: The circulation of adipose tissue is several times greater than in submerged tissue, which is why scientists advocate a healthy diet and regular exercise. A good, healthy lifestyle can frequently rectify the issue, but for critical cases, weight loss surgery may be required.\n\nOver the age of 40: Over the age of 40, the risk of cervical radiculopathy grows dramatically. The body and its various components and functions might then begin to weaken.\n\nCorticosteroid use and cervical radiculopathy: Cervical radiculopathy is created by a genetic interaction spanning from development to adulthood. Corticosteroids have an impact on the formation of cervical radiculopathy symptoms, which continues till the tissues of cells become unable to function. This is known as property deterioration.", "Cervical radiculopathy is pain that stems from irritation to the nerve roots that come from the cervical spine. This can be the result of muscle pulling on the nerve of a herniated disc in the area, resulting in pain that radiates all the way to the lower limbs.\n\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>\n\nCervical radiculopathy is a common problem that has varying symptoms based on the level of damage. The weakness, numbness and pain typically stem from the neck, and may radiate to the arm, to the shoulder, or it may be limited to the neck itself.\n\n<h3>Common neck symptoms:</h3>\n\n* Stiffness\n\n* Tenderness\n\n* Pain when moving the neck or turning to the side\n\n\n<h3>Toes, feet or legs:</h3>\n\n* Sensations of pins and needles\n\n* Numbness\n\n* Burning\n\n* Weakness\n\n\n<h2>Causes/Conditions</h2>\n\nCervical radiculopathy is a common problem that has varying symptoms based on the level of damage. There are many common causes:\n\n* Herniated or Bulging Disc: Degeneration in the spine, can change the shape of the disc (herniated) or make the disc worn and lose some cushioning (bulging or degenerative disc). A herniated disc is a condition in which the soft inner material of the disc pushes out the tough outer wall. Thus pushing on the surrounding nerve roots.\n\n* Arthritis: On the Chiropractic side of things, a problem with the alignment or position of the bones of the spine can cause a pressure on the nerves or disc.\n\n<h2>Treatment for Cervical Radiculopathy</h2>\n\nConservative treatment: Chiropractic adjustments along with a rehabilitation program are the standard conservative treatment for disc problems. A program of stretching and strengthening can help improve spinal curvature, decreasing the chances of future damage and disc injury.\n\nOur soft tissue approach is often the most effective against nerve pain, through the use of Graston\u00ae technique, and other techniques such as Kinesiotaping, SWIHA and Doppler ultrasound.\n\nHeat therapy: Used to cause relaxation, induce vasodilation of the nerve and surrounding tissues. Heat is applied to the joint.\n\nCryotherapy: Used to decrease inflammation and reduce pain. Cold is applied to the joint.\n\nPain medications: may be used to treat the acute pain until injury can be repaired and rehabilitation can begin.", "The cervical spine is located in the neck. It contains many vertebrae, which support the head and protect the spinal cord.\n\nThe spinal cord makes up the central core of the entire spine. It has nerves that exit and enter at each respective vertebrae. There are 8 bones in the cervical spine: C1-C2, C3-C7 (C3 going into T1). Another nerve that exits from the cervical spine is the brachial plexus.\n\nThe brachial plexus is a distribution of nerves that enters the spinal cord at the neck into the arms, through the shoulders, to the hand.\n\nOutside of the spine, doctors refer to this as peripheral nerves.\n\nOne set of nerves is called cervical radiculopathy. These are located between each of the cervical vertebrae.\n\nIt affects only one side of the body. If you have both upper extremities involved with the radiculopathy, this usually indicates involvement from cervical canal narrowing.\n\nIf the cervical or lumbar spine is creating pressure on these nerves, as the peripheral nerves come out of the spine that leads to symptoms. If the peripheral nerve is under excessive pressure, it can possibly lead to a tender, painful sensation, affecting the nerves that lead to that muscle, putting the patient in a lot of pain.\n\nThe lower extremity radiculopathy is usually associated with the lumbar spine. That is because the lumbar spine becomes compressed due to lower back surgery. The lower back usually happens because of degenerative disc disease or slip degenerating, depending on your age and lifestyle.\n\nIf there is a narrowing anywhere in the spine, that will start to pinch the nerves, that will create a pressure effect. This mainly can be helped by chiropractic manipulation.\n\nIf it does not get men up by a chiropractor, then a patient will need to see an MD to get x-rays or an MRI.\n\nIn some cases, when it becomes more serious, a surgical opinion may be necessary.\n\nFor the lower extremities, radiculopathy is typically associated with a narrowing in the lumbar spine, which would involve leg pain, numbness, or tingling sensations on one side of the body.\n\nIf you have sciatica, meaning leg pain radiating in some degree through your leg or foot, then it is a lumbar problem that involves the nerves.\n\nIf the cause of discomfort has not been identified, stimulating the nerves can help with pain and affect the type of medicine used for pain.\n\nMedicines aren't the only treatment options \u2014 consider chiropractic care that focuses on your total recovery."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5847, "rouge1_r": 0.1675, "rouge1_f1": 0.2604, "rouge2_p": 0.2479, "rouge2_r": 0.0706, "rouge2_f1": 0.1098, "rougel_p": 0.3475, "rougel_r": 0.0995, "rougel_f1": 0.1547, "bleurt": 0.4059, "bert_score_p": 0.8125, "bert_score_r": 0.8511, "bert_score_f1": 0.8313, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3305, "rouge1_r": 0.3645, "rouge1_f1": 0.3467, "rouge2_p": 0.0769, "rouge2_r": 0.0849, "rouge2_f1": 0.0807, "rougel_p": 0.1695, "rougel_r": 0.1869, "rougel_f1": 0.1778, "bleurt": 0.2717, "bert_score_p": 0.8398, "bert_score_r": 0.8448, "bert_score_f1": 0.8423, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5932, "rouge1_r": 0.1724, "rouge1_f1": 0.2672, "rouge2_p": 0.1282, "rouge2_r": 0.037, "rouge2_f1": 0.0575, "rougel_p": 0.3136, "rougel_r": 0.0911, "rougel_f1": 0.1412, "bleurt": 0.2988, "bert_score_p": 0.8206, "bert_score_r": 0.8637, "bert_score_f1": 0.8416, "hallucination": 76.92307692307693, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5254, "rouge1_r": 0.1582, "rouge1_f1": 0.2431, "rouge2_p": 0.1197, "rouge2_r": 0.0358, "rouge2_f1": 0.0551, "rougel_p": 0.3136, "rougel_r": 0.0944, "rougel_f1": 0.1451, "bleurt": 0.2846, "bert_score_p": 0.8066, "bert_score_r": 0.8508, "bert_score_f1": 0.8281, "hallucination": 23.076923076923077, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6356, "rouge1_r": 0.2066, "rouge1_f1": 0.3119, "rouge2_p": 0.1966, "rouge2_r": 0.0635, "rouge2_f1": 0.096, "rougel_p": 0.3305, "rougel_r": 0.1074, "rougel_f1": 0.1622, "bleurt": 0.3264, "bert_score_p": 0.8042, "bert_score_r": 0.8598, "bert_score_f1": 0.831, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.6017, "rouge1_r": 0.1695, "rouge1_f1": 0.2644, "rouge2_p": 0.1795, "rouge2_r": 0.0502, "rouge2_f1": 0.0785, "rougel_p": 0.3051, "rougel_r": 0.0859, "rougel_f1": 0.1341, "bleurt": 0.3276, "bert_score_p": 0.8165, "bert_score_r": 0.8431, "bert_score_f1": 0.8296, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

EEG</h3>\n\nAn electroencephalogram measures the activity of electrical propagation across the brain. It traces the neuron's electrical activity but does not measure the physical brain or spinal cord. They are most useful looking at issues in timing, frequency, and rhythm.\n\n<h3>3. CT</h3>\n\nThis non-invasive, non-adverse X-ray can detect all kinds of problems with the brain and spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and the tissue and chemicals of the nervous system.\n\n<h3>4. Physical Exam</h3>\n\nFirst and foremost is the exam performed by a therapist. This must be a thorough functional examination to provide a starting point and baseline for comparison and to shape treatment.\n\n<h2>Rehabilitation inverted and redefined</h2>\n\nAs we grew up, rehabilitation had a very simple meaning. In those terms, rehab was \u201cre-habbing,\u201d as in repairing an athletic muscle injury or a broken bone.", "When one dictionary meaning of the word neurological is \u201cof or relating to the nervous system,\u201d it\u2019s easy to see that some issues stem from the communication between your brain and other parts of your body.\n\nThis type of issue can cause a range of different symptoms and medical issues, which is why treatment may include various treatments from various professionals.\n\n<h3>Causes of neurological issues</h3>\n\nAccording to the Lupus Foundation of American, your genetics, environmental factors, and autoimmune responses (when your body\u2019s immune system mistakenly targets its own cells) may all play a role in how your nervous system functions.\n\nIn general, the brain\u2019s neurons and your body\u2019s nerves usually coordinate and convince your body that there\u2019s no immediate danger.\n\nHowever, a neurological issue can reduce your brain\u2019s ability to communicate the difference between a light and a heavy touch.\n\nSimilarly, having had a neurological issue long enough can remove a part of your \u201cmuscle memory\u201d or ability to \u201cremember\u201d certain ways of doing things.\n\nFor example, a car accident might result in damage to the brain\u2019s movement pathways, which slows down your ability to drive.\n\nA study in the Journal of American Science details how learning constraints present after about 6 months following a brain injury can significantly reduce your performance in your daily life and without proper treatment.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to know that neurological issues aren\u2019t caused by the same triggers. A traumatic brain injury (TBI) can show up very differently from a stroke.\n\nSome of the factors that can cause a neurological issue include:\n\n* anxiety\n* an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or multiple sclerosis\n* attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or attention deficit disorder (ADD)\n* asthma\n* bacterial infections\n* cancer\n* chemical imbalance\n* recent brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system injury\n* toxins such as pesticides, certain drugs, and extremely high doses of iron\n\n<h3>Long-term neurological issues</h3>\n\nThe Mayo Clinic elaborates on how some complex diseases, like Parkinson\u2019s disease, which disproportionally affects the Lar Reaimi, a practicing neurologist who specializes in stroke and neurovascular disorders in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nA neurological issue that\u2019s been around long enough can cause widespread damage to the affected areas of your body. A loss of motor function, reduced communication, and even cognitive abilities are also possible.\n\nOf course, your recovery and how long you\u2019ll be dealing with the effects of your neurological condition largely", "Dr. Stanislav Velasco, head endocrinologist at Hotel Dieu de France Hospital \u2013 Verdun, highlights the dangers of a thyroid dysfunction affecting fetal development.\n\nWhen it comes to prescription of antibiotics, doctors are confronted with one question: antibiotics or not?

While this creates the fear of missing out for most of us, it is non-negotiable that everything has a limit.\n\nDear Professor Pola Lacroix from the Department of Accounting at the School of Business at the American University of Beirut (AUB),\n\nOn November 20, a conference on \u201cOccupational Health and Safety Prevention\u201d was convened at the Volkswagen University of Applied Sciences. Moderating the panel was Dany Khoury, Assistant General Manager of Industrial Clinic Consulting (ICC), who welcomed his guests.\n\n\"It all started with a desire to establish a center that offers a unique and innovative educational experience to attract Lebanese and foreign students in the Greater Beirut and surrounding areas\" \u2013", "It\u2019s when a body system problem is first and it\u2019s not recorded by the doctor or any other medical worker. Such problems like not being right with the help of having a negative effect on a child. Children that are considered to have this issue don\u2019t fit in with other children their age. They can not enjoy the unity of other kids and do things together.\n\nTo see clearly your child\u2019s neurological disorder you have to learn more about all health issues which may arise during these problems. It\u2019s when kids have to contribute a lot more psychiatric, medical, and neurological inputs. All of which is certainly affecting the development of children. It\u2019s when you hear children are not able to engage in their specific learning disorder. All of the down syndrome disorders or out in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the character of a neurological issue? It\u2019s when the habits associated with problems are very different when you compared other kids. Now you can view the child condition of different people which experience neurological issues as individual things that must be hidden. But in most cases, it tends to entail a lack of insight. Also, have a thirst for a good place to take action for your children.\n\nHow can the neurological problem change for your kids? Permanent changes occur with kids these days too. Your child can change in more than just a way that may benefit you in the present, but it can be very helpful in the long run. Take your child out to play, and have them do something that they enjoy.\n\nIt is not hard for you to find out how life-changing it is to start playing the right activities from the very beginning. Those children who aren\u2019t able to relax well and have a lot of trouble to integrate well with their environment. Try to find a way so this can happen. Hopefully, neurological issues waiting .\n\nThere\u2019s no need to prove anything to make the kids relax but in the normal world, they\u2019re not. So parents should do more to ensure the stability of their kids\u2019. Creating an opportunity doesn\u2019t happen by doing this but by being willing to collect.\n\nIn case you have any interest in the importance of providing your children with the better world then there are lots of great options. You\u2019ll find a variety of kid\u2019s toys on the marketplace and you will be able to find a kid\u2019s store in the area or even online. Start getting together with your children again.", "A neurological issue is something that affects the nerves and the brain. It may make it difficult for you to do everyday things like walk or talk and could also cause:\n\n* headaches\n* seizures\n* problems with your sense of smell, sight, or hearing\n* shrinking of your organs\n* loss of coordination\n* paralysis\n* drowsiness\n* sexual dysfunction\n\nMany neurological problems affect multiple parts of the body.\n\nWhat are some possible causes?\n\nA number of neurological problems can stem from heart disease. The most common is heart failure, which is a major risk factor for strokes. People with heart failure often tend to have elevated levels of fats and other proteins in their blood. Strokes are particularly common among people with these conditions:\n\n* hypertension, or high blood pressure\n* atherosclerosis, or the narrowing and hardening of the arteries\n* irregular heart beat\n* congenital heart defects\n* congenital heart defects\n\nNeurological problems can also affect the cardiovascular system. For example, a stroke is a common neurological problem that causes a specific type of heart attack when the blood supply to the heart is cut off. Other neurological conditions that can have a detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system include:\n\n* Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n* epilepsy\n* Parkinson\u2019s disease\n* multiple sclerosis\n\nWhen should I call a doctor?\n\nYou should call your doctor if you\u2019re having issues with your heart or your nerves. Schedule an annual check-up with your doctor even if you don\u2019t have any specific symptoms. A primary care physician can help you keep track of your health.\n\nIf you do notice problems, here are some general guidelines on when you may need to go to the emergency room or urgent care.\n\nThe general guidelines are only a starting point. Always see a doctor when you have concerns.\n\nIs there an at-home test for neurological problems?\n<h3>Cholesterol</h3>\n\nThe main purpose of a complete blood chemistry test is to measure your blood\u2019s cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These values tell your doctor about your risk of heart disease and stroke. You can have these tests done as part of your annual physical examination. Your doctor might also recommend them on their own if you have conditions that interfere with the metabolism of fats like obesity or diabetes.\n\nThese tests are inexpensive and readily available.\n\n<h3>Electrolyte imbalance</h3>\n\nElectrolyte balance testing is usually done as part of a standard lab panel that your doctor orders when you are sick or injured.

Most often, oily skin glands in these areas become blocked, disrupting the regular production of oil and triggering an inflammatory response. So, your eyelids may swell, become red, and itch, and your eyes may feel dry, gritty, or sensitive to light.\n\nSome people may also notice:\n\n* dandruff seeping out of their sebaceous glands\n* yellow or brown crusts on their eyelids, especially in the morning\n* difficulty opening their eyes in the morning from tight eyelids\n* eyelashes that grow outward or curl toward their surface (entropion)\n* a pimple-like pustule in the inner lid corner, a condition called a hordeolum (stye)\n* irritation in the corner of the eye\n* eye pain\n\n<h3>Types of blepharitis</h3>\n\nBlepharitis can be front-edge or back-edge. Front-edge refers to where the eyelashes are attached, and back refers to the part of your eye the eyelashes turn inward toward.\n\n<h4>Anterior Blepharitis</h4>\n\nIn anterior blepharitis, which affects the front edge of the eyelid, an oily substance called sebum becomes blocked in the sebaceous glands in your fr\u00f6hland and becomes clogged. These glands are responsible for providing oil and moisture to keep your lashes moisturized and keeps them from damaging your cornea with friction. Your immune system can also contribute to front-edge blepharitis when your white blood cells and antibodies get involved in the process.\n\n<h4>Posterior blepharitis</h4>\n\nPosterior blepharitis occurs at the combination edges of the lower and upper lids, where the eyelash attaches to your eye. The glands that are present at this junction are responsible for producing the oil, just like the franco-grease, but with a different quality, which allows your eyes and cornea to lubricate properly. They are located next to the inner corner of your eyes with the upper lid above and the lower lid below.\n\nAlthough not the most dominating, posterior blepharitis accounts for 50% of cases of the total cases of blepharitis. The other half is divided between anterior blepharitis and combined anterior-posterior blepharitis (25%).\n\nIf you have posterior blepharitis, you may experience movement or bulging of the lid at the lash line. Additionally, as the anterior pleuritis develops, its inflammation below can affect the surface of your eyes, WebDriver", "It\u2019s one of the most common issues patients struggle with, yet it\u2019s often overlooked or misunderstood.

Its most common forms are\n\n* anterior blepharitis, which affects tear glands on the outer surface of the eyelid\n* posterior blepharitis, which affects the inner surface of the eyelid\n\nIn anterior blepharitis, the tear glands become inflamed. It can be associated with other conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis.\n\nPosterior blepharitis is associated with dandruff on the scalp, or seborrheic dermatitis. Not everyone with seborrheic dermatitis develops posterior blepharitis, and not everyone with posterior blepharitis has seborrheic dermatitis.\n\nCauses of blepharitis\n\nThe two main causes of blepharitis are a buildup of debris on the lashes and oily skin around the eyelids.\n\nIn some cases, blepharitis can be a symptom of a underlying medical condition, such as:\n\n* contact dermatitis\n* diabetes\n* thyroid disorders\n* rosacea\n* vitamin A deficiency\n* lice\n* eyelash mites\n\nMost cases of blepharitis are the result of oily skin around the eye and excess skin oils in the lashes. Sebum, the skin\u2018s natural oil, is produced by glands in the eyelids and the eyelashes. When they become blocked, sebum builds up on the eyelids and lashes.\n\nDry eyes caused by vitamin A deficiency may result in recurrent blepharitis. For example, women are six times as likely as men to have dry eyes.\n\nDermatitis and blepharitis\n\nMost cases of blepharitis are the result of dermatitis. There are different types of dermatitis, including:\n\n* <strong>Seborrheic dermatitis.</strong> The type of dermatitis most closely linked to blepharitis. It is caused by a yeast that builds up on the body and skin surfaces.\n* <strong>Contact dermatitis.</strong> Caused by lotions, creams, and cosmetics and skin products on eyelids.\n* <strong>Atopic dermatitis.</strong> Commonly known as eczema. The cause is unknown.\n* <strong>Irritant dermatitis.</strong> Can be caused by coming in contact with an irritant such as an herbicide or pesticide or an allergen.\n\nDiagnosing blepharitis\n\nA person can be diagnosed with blepharitis when they:\n\n* have shortened eyelashes\n* have red eyes\n* have eyelid irritation\n* notice flakes on their lashes resulting in eyelashes that clump together or there is a cheesy white crusting\n\nA", "More than 80 million Americans experience dry eye syndrome at an increased rate as they age. However, more than two thirds of dry eye sufferers over 60 aren\u2019t properly diagnosed because misdiagnosis is common. Diagnostic tests are needed to properly rule out aging as a result of dry eye.\n\nMost dry eye syndrome has nothing to do with saliva at all \u2014 the typical burning, smarting sensation is caused by dryness at the level of the eye surface, from the tear film that coats the eyeball. The natural tear film consists of a top layer of lipids, produced by the oil glands along the top margin of the eyelid; beneath that layer is the middle layer, or aqueous layer, which is produced by the lacrimal gland; and below that is the mucin layer underneath which the vitreous humor of the eyeball resides.\n\nThe oil glands which produce the lipid layer occasionally become blocked, which leads to reduced lipid output and also means that the tears generated evaporate too quickly. For a small group of people, dry eye is caused by two different glands in the eye itself: Meibomian glands, which also produce the lipid layer are blocked; and the conjunctival lacrimal glands, located at the upper edge of the eyeball\u2019s white part, which fail to produce enough of the aqueous layer, leading to thin tears as well that fail to wash away irritants and foreign bodies.\n\nBoth of these conditions can generally be corrected by trimming back the upper eyelid edge \u2014 a process called \u201ctarsorrhaphy\u201d that tightens up the tear layer.\n\nSometimes dry eyes are due to certain factors that irritate the eye surface \u2014 color contact lenses, smoke or dust. If meibomian glands are blocked, hypofunctional or behaved, affected tears may fail to properly lubricate and moisturize the eye surface. Reduced tear volume often exacerbates the problem, as well.\n\nIn order to diagnose dry eye, you must first understand tear film production. Tear film is produced as a solution, typically made up of 84 percent water, 10 percent salts, 5 percent proteins, and 1 percent lipids and mucus. Along with the tears produced constantly by your tear glands, you blink about 10 times every minute, dispersing oil from your meibomian glands along the edges of your eyelids.\n\nThe perfect tears moisten, protect, keep you seeing clearly, signal the brain that there are no pathogens getting near your eyes, and serve as a barrier to particle incursion.", "Blepharitis refers to irritation and inflammation of your eyelids. It\u2019s characterized by scaly, itchy crusts and flakes at the root of your eyelashes.\n\nThis condition is not serious, but it can cause discomfort and flakey eyelashes, increasingly heavy crusts, and occasional ocular burning.\n\nIt\u2019s most prevalent among adults aged 20 to 40 years, with a slightly higher case rate in women than in men.\n\nThe cause of blepharitis is often unclear. Chronic blepharitis results from an earlier episode of acute blepharitis.\n\n<h3>What can cause it?</h3>\n\nThe internal secretions in your eyes are needed for long-term eye health. They lubricate the eyes and fight off pathogens. People with blepharitis have deficiency in their eyelid secretions. This restricts the natural flow of lipids and antimicrobial proteins.\n\nThe resulting dryness and irritation may cause sensation disturbances, like burning and itching. Infectious conditions are also linked with the onset of blepharitis. The most common sources are bacteria, viruses, and mites.\n\nOil gland dysfunction may also be associated with certain diseases, such as arthritis and rosacea. Other factors that may contribute to the onset of blepharitis include:\n\n* aging\n* allergic reactions from eye makeup products or shampoo\n* poor circulation in your eyelids\n* oily skin\n* pregnancy due to fluctuating hormones\n* poor hygiene\n* prolonged wearing of contact lenses\n\nHow is blepharitis treated?\n\nUse a warm compress to help unblock conjunctivitis along with a warm salt solution as a final step to decontaminate. On a regular schedule, apply the compress to the entire eyelid region to alleviate symptoms and keep chronic infection at bay.\n\nKeep in mind that instead of bedtime, applying a warm and wet damp cloth to the eyes may be more effective, particularly in the morning. That way, you\u2019ll get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nConsider seeing your eye doctor for:\n\n* eye drops to relieve the inflammation\n* antibiotics if your eyelids are infected\n* wearing glasses for a few months if a scar is mildly impairing vision\n\nIn some cases, blepharitis can become worse. Follow your eye doctor\u2019s advice on following practices to manage symptoms.\n\nDepending on the severity, blepharitis treatment options include:\n\n<strong>BlephEx</strong>: This is a non-invasive procedure that removes the crust as the sedative takes effect.

It can help disrupt the skin\u2019s excess production of sebum.2\n\nAdditionally, cefdinir may also be effective in acne treatment that is caused by methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.\n\n\u201cCommonly, why you see a lot of recurrence is because bacteria, particularly <em>Staphylococcus</em>, is becoming very resistant to antibiotics,\u201d Dr. Chen explains. <em>(More on that in a moment.)</em>\n\nAlong with its possible acne treatment applications, cefdinir is known to help fight off a broad range of bacterial infections.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s often recommended in secondary and tertiary care hospitals by doctors and pharmacists to treat bacterial infections caused by commonly occurring bacteria.\n\nInjectable cefdinir (Cedeldin 1-gram injection) is also used to treat meningitis that\u2019s caused by <em>Neisseria meningitides</em> amongst other similar diseases including septicemia.\n\nCheapest places to buy cefdinir\n\nCefdinir is an antibiotic that is available as a generic drug but there\u2019s also a brand version (Omnicef) available for those who can afford the brand prices.\n\nCefdinir is available in oral liquid form as well as a twice-daily orally", "Cefdinir is an antibiotic that helps to fight bacterial infections. It may be used to treat mild to moderate infections caused by bacteria.\n\nThe most commonly prescribed uses for cefdinir are urinary tract infections and ear infections. These bacteria are commonly thought to be the culprits behind these infections, including the following organisms:\n\n* <em>E. coli</em>\n* <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>\n* <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>\n* <em>Proteus</em>\n* <em>Klebsiella</em>\n* <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus </em>\n\nThe physician may prescribe cefdinir to be used on its own or in conjunction with other antibiotics for specific infections. Drug interaction should also be considered\n\nIt\u2019s very important to take the exact amount and dosage that a physician prescribes. Cefdinir must be taken regularly at evenly spaced times throughout the day. Missing a dose should be compensated for with the subsequent dose, but dosage should not be doubled.\n\nCefdinir is considered safe for consumption among healthy adults and as early as 2 weeks of age. Speak to a physician for an exact statement on dosage, safety, and side effects for any specific case of use and query.\n\nPossible side effects for cefdinir use\n\nThe following list is not conclusive, exhaustive, or intended to be used in the place of consulting a physician. Instead, these are verifications of evidence-based studies currently in progress.\n\n<h3>Primary side effects</h3>\n\nSome of the more frequent side effects that result from cefdinir use include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n* diarrhea\n* headache\n* rash\n* nausea\n* pain at the injection site (for an injection)\n\nDiarrhea usually occurs within the first few days of starting treatment with cefdinir. This usually means that the antibiotic is doing its job, meaning it must kill certain bacteria. Side effects that occur after 5 days may be signs of a stronger bacteria that has grown resistant to the antibiotic. Contact your doctor if diarrhea persists or if this side effect does not stop in 7\u20138 days.\n\nNausea and vomiting may also occur during the use of cefdinir. If this side effect persists, speak with a physician before further progressing with treatment dosage.\n\nHeadache is another side effect of cefdinir. The headache may develop due to a sudden blood pressure drop after the presence of antibiotics. If the headache persists, do not take other medications to alleviate the side effect. Speak to a physician about reducing", "When is cefdinir used?\n\nAnswer:\n\nCefdinir is a first-line antibiotic for treating bacterial infections.

{"Question": "What is sciatica", "Free_form_answer": "Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the sciatic nerve path due to sciatic nerve injury or irritation. The most common cause of sciatica is compression of the sciatic nerve root by a herniated disc in the spine. Classically, the pain affects one side of the body and radiates from the buttock down the back of the leg to below the knee. The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks. The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated.

There are several options when it comes to sciatica treatment Agoura Hills CA\u2014it just takes relief here at Natural Health Today. To prevent the pain from coming back, you can take measures to protect your spine, which includes maintaining an active lifestyle, not smoking, maintaining good posture, eating a balanced diet, and using proper lifting techniques when you need to. Sitting incorrectly puts the strain on the sciatic nerve and makes it more likely for sciatica to develop. There data indicate the main causes of sciatica include:\n\n* Disc herniation - which can cause pressure on the nerve and potentially trigger sciatica\n* Osteoarthritis - when lower back joints are sp saludable Hiena hurts\n* Osteoporosis - which affects the whole bone in the body and causes the bones to weaken\n* Spinal stenosis - a condition that comes with no cushion between the discs, making adjacent bones rub together and trigger the onset of sciatica\n\nHow does chiropractic treatment help?\n\nThe spine is very crucial to the health and functionality of people of all ages. We constantly make the mistake of not caring for it until the problem gets out of hand and we need emergency chiropractic treatment. We do not only treat because of the pain but also due to sudden death, and lifestyle damage that may occur with neglect or no treatment at all.\n\n<strong>Chiropractic Care for Your Spine</strong>\n\nOur spine serves as a support for acts, posture, and its main role is to provide protection for the nerves in the body. Any disturbance to the normal position or motion of the spine may adversely affect the proper function of the body as a whole.  In Agoura Hills CA, natural, non-invasive treatment of the body is our topmost priority using chiropractic techniques as the most economical and least invasive way to treat the body naturally. Our physicians are board-certified and trained to identify and treat most visual symptoms, and even use various diagnostic tools to help in the accurate pain analysis and diagnosis, providing relaxation through focused spinal manipulation. The procedure improves manual adjustments in the body, and stretches and strengthens the muscles as well.\n\n<strong>Causes of Spinal Injuries</strong>\n\n* Decrease in mobility, that is, you go years without exercising even if it\u2019s simple exercises that will be helpful to the body\n* Poor sleeping positions\n* Unbalanced diet or stress, such as sudden weight gain or loss\n* Excess consumption of alcohol\n*", "Sciatica is due to compression of the sciatic nerve, which normally receives its exit from the lumbosacral area below the L4 osteomedullary junction. The symptom of <u>radiating pain</u> as a result of sciatic nerve irritation is one of the fundamental symptoms of chronic lumbosacral pathology.\n\nIn medical terms, sciatica is caused by structural pathological processes at the L4-S1 proximal (subosteomedullary) segment, which cause compression of the sciatic nerve.\n\nThere is a syndrome that resembles sciatic nerve compression, which occurs in the absence of osteomedullary pathology. It is called \"low-grade radial pain\".\n\nPeople with chronic functional disorders (L4 and L5 lumber discs) and elderly people who suffered damage to low-back intervertebral discs and/or suffered fractures, especially secondary to weight lifting as a result of the professions or amateur sports (boxing, martial arts, judo, etc.), suffer from sciatica.\n\nSerious but common structural damages can be present in the bones and tubes of the lumbosacral spine. These findings include:\n\n-           Degenerative-sclerosing processes,\n\n-           L5 spill; I. e. L4-5 lumber disc displacement into the master intervertebral foramen,\n\n-           L4 and L5 disc herniation into the spinal cavity,\n\n-           Lower lumber vertebra fracture, especially in memory of sport. With that in mind, it should be said that reconstruction of the sciatic nerve often follows, in the absence of any therapy but surgery, traumatic actions and the subsequent use of crutches, and sometimes even bone formation. When the sciatic nerve regenerates, in 10% of people the pain disappears without any need of further medical intervention.\n\nSciatica causes more than pain \n\nIn addition to radiating pain, sciatica often causes other symptoms. These include: lower numbness, lower limb weakness (loss of strength) and, if severe, lower limbs paralysis, as well as transmitted complaints from the internally sensitive second order dorsal root ganglion cells that are located on the lateral walls of the vertebral canal. Those complaints include headache, facial nerve paralysis, sensitivity and autonomic disorders, i.e. problems with temperature sensitivity and sweat disorders.\n\nAny traumatic actions on the tendons and ligaments, and spinal canal narrowing often coexist with sciatica as well. Our clients often complain about the numbness, heavy lower limbs. As well as other sensations, such as feeling that", "Sciatica is an orthopedic or neurologic diagnosis that refers to a variety of conditions that cause pain running along the sciatic nerve.\n\nThe sciatic nerve starts in the lower back, just below the spinal cord. It varies in size before splitting into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. While the sciatic nerve is the largest and longest nerve in the body, the tibial and common peroneal nerves are medium-sized.\n\nThe sciatic nerve functions as the major motor and sensory nerve in the lower body. It innervates all the muscles in the lower body and provides sensory feedback to the brain from the lower limbs. Division of the sciatic nerve into the tibial and common peroneal nerves along with lesser posterior branch of the sciatic nerve result in spinal sensory and motor innervation to almost all areas of the lower limbs, along with the medial and distal area of the thigh.\n\nSciatica can be a sign of a variety of conditions that involve the sciatic nerve, including:\n\n* a herniated disk\n* a spinal stenosis\n* osteoarthritis\n* a tumor\n\nMost cases of sciatica are associated with discogenic sciatica, a condition that occurs as a result of a herniated disk. A person can also experience scoliotic sciatica if they have scoliosis.\n\nTreatment for sciatica depends on the underlying cause.

Research published in June 2019 shows that Apa meets this statement: a study of more than 25,000 people from 23 countries showed a range of up to 50% expressed that sleep apnea increases the risk of the disease by 71%. 6 data on sex (gender), race (skin color) and response to stress does not explain it all, but are also factors that increase the risk of high blood pressure.\n\nLearned means that short or long term rule is a humanistic approach (contribution of society and their own valuable experience) to reduce the risks of various health problems. For example, help each other at holiday hours, initial customer consultation and telephone call, counselling the community on risk factors, within lifetime reductionism theories, and also from work methods can be theories or methods applied to improve health. diabetes metabolic syndrome: classic study found that insulin resistance increased in an animal model (rats), when a high blood pressure was applied to them.\n\nSimilar in humans, meanwhile, an experimental study in 2016 found that individuals with hypertension had a higher fasting response to glucose compared to human. (Clinical syndrome is diabetes because of insulin resistance) More drug, certainly we are talking about a list of drugs to treat hypertension. Like many other diseases, hypertension can be controlled with medication, is known as the use of cilnidipine, azilsartan, eplerenone therapy, bendrofluazide. These medications are often present in the hospital, but also in the pharmacy.\n\nImpact of high blood pressure on erectile dysfunction, results, empowers previous conclusion,", "Many physicians believe diabetic patients with stage 1 hypertension (65-79 mm Hg) should be treated with low-dose diuretics and a low-salt diet, but research published in the <em>Longitudinal Investigation of Diabetes in Adults</em> (LENA) and the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> shows this to be ineffective. The study, comparing both low and high-doses of diuretics and ACE inhibitors in 282 hypertensive-diabetic men ages 25-85, found that ACEIs significantly lowered blood pressure, while diuretics did not.

Fevers are commonly associated with infectious diseases, but can also be a symptom of autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. Treating a fever can help alleviate accompanying symptoms like headaches, muscle and joint pain, or febrile seizures in children. Medications like acetaminophen (paracetamol) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can be used to lower fever. Acetaminophen is usually recommended first due to fewer side effects than NSAIDs, but short-term use of either drug is safe for healthy individuals without kidney or liver impairment.

The lining of the mouth is flushed red when it is cold and unflushed pink when warm.\n\nLittle swaying afferent contraction of your toes can cause minor nosebleeds, so don't exceed the vibrations when a mild fever is present.\n\nAs with many thermal sensations, there are two important interactions. First, there may be a strong interaction between your thermal sensation and the amount (say frequency) of stimulation. With heterogeneity in stimulus distribution, the sensation matches with the average of the individual stimuli. Second, individual differences in sensory threshold can be explained by displacement sensing, such as that associated with manual massage. When a sense (vision and hearing) is partially restricted during stimulation, it is sometimes easier to feel these stretches.\n\nAnother temperature measure is earbathing, similar to infrared scanning.

The main task is to strengthen the immune system of the patient. As immune system plays a vital role in producing white blood cells (WBC) so, preventing WBC\u2019s destruction is very crucial. A variety of microorganisms like viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites attack the body and cause various diseases.\n\nBlood stream infection also known as the Sepsis fever is a disease which is dangerous in nature.

We hear about this disease regularly from walk-in patients complaining of high fever. When the temperature is greater than 101oF (38.3oC) person is considered ill and in the higher range they develop fever. The children with 102oF (38.8oC) fever are obviously suffering from the more serious condition.\n\nFor any person, dehydration is highly common due to endless vomiting or diarrhoea. In such a condition, the body is robbed of important fluids, electrolytes and nutrients. For an example, chronic pancreatitis that causes vomiting for long time and the patient become undiagnosed dehydration. So, 108 mobile ambulance assistance is deployed for such patients for speedy recovery.\n\n<strong>Overview</strong>\n\nA point to note is that high fever can also be damaged for pets.

It\u2019s a headache that can cause you massive pain and misery and is often episodic and recurrent but never predictable. \n\nSome important facts about cluster headaches:  \n\n* One in 1000 of the population are affected by cluster headaches, or up to 5% in people over 65. \n\n* 3 times more common in men than in women. \n\n* 40 times more common in the left nostril rather than the right. \n\n* There is often a family history of the condition. \n\n* Very common to have bad vision in one eye and nose on the affected side. There is also often numbness to the tongue. \n\n* 80% of people affected experience complete relief of symptoms after 3 months \n\n\nSigns and Symptoms: \n\n\nThe most common symptoms of a cluster headache is severe facial pain that normally starts in the orbit but can start behind the eye but have been known to be felt in the side of the nose. Bowing down over an ice pack for 15 - 20 minutes will trigger the pain and not alleviate it. A cluster headache will reflect the 3 phases of a Migraine with the exception being that there is no aura before the headache.\n\nAnalyses of a cluster headache: \n\n\n* Pain is felt as stabbing, even if described as throbbing pain \n\n* Pain is usually behind one side of the eye \n\n* Eye watering and redness of the eye \n\n* Nasal congestion or frequent sneezing \n\n* Nasal discharge from the affected side of the nose \n\n* Eye tearing \n\n* Eye rubbing or squeezing of the eyes \n\n* Swelling of the face \n\n* A dull headache which lasts between 15 - 180minutes \n\n* One third of sufferers experience a cold sensation in the affected side of the nose a short time after the pain has stopped \n\n\nDiagnosing cluster headaches\n\n\nA cluster headache is usually diagnosed by a combination of your symptoms and a complete questionnaire on the episodes. It is important to know that cluster headaches tend to begin after 30 years of age and then can stop by age 50+ so most patients have a full life ahead of them e.g. after a few years of cure. \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nUltrasound treatment usually", "If you google zoltai cluster device, you will find that it pulsates/vibrates in rythm with your pulse.

And theres a zoltai cluster device for sale on the line\nIt all makes sense. The headaches are genuine, the health pros are genuine, the kms that they travel, the days and weeks or months of them experiencing them and case studies of individuals that get lengthy relief for periods of time for each case, not to mention the weaknesses in humanity of stress, war, excess amount of information that the mind can cope with, the box ticking exercise of a health journey, all of which a doctors first line of attack, in most cases, is \u2018attitude, vaccinations, asthma\u2019 When!!! You know you weren\u2019t raised with asthma and you know your never smoked. Thats a new diagnosis. Just tell the doctor whats wrong so he has the right pressure point to hit. All it takes is that million dollar pill that not even the drug lords manufacture. One cure for one type of headache and now you\u2019re all over that drug company for the next 10 years.\n\n\nBy the way this is NOT that kind of headache. This kind of headache is the one you have, thats killing your quality of life, takes over your mental endurance in a day and makes reducing it that important, because it continues over time.\n\n\nThat headache makes you seek out headaches, some level of analgesia, sometimes with success but always a fleeting one. Nothing beats the O.S. basal ganglia changing over to stem cell. I see it all the time with MS and CFS patients. It does happen! But that only takes place after suffering the headache for a while. You cant avoid having the headache in the first place by fedring Moreld like a swan departing. You just got to go for that mahhth attack, expect it to stay when you hit it and never give in again!!

He is a voice for research, alternative practices and changes in western medicine", "is a terrible episodic /periodic headache and it effects around 1 in 1000 people. The condition is generally unilateral, but it is actually the history and aggravating factors that provide the key to diagnosis. They usually occur in patients in the 4th to 5th decade. They are agonising headaches that involve the eye and are described as a 'knife like', sudden crippling or excruciating headache in that eye or sinus region.\n\nThere is often a feeling of tightness in the throat and a feeling of tension or pressure in the facial region. The inflammation affects the structures in the sinuses. Cluster headache is associated with symptoms of a runny nose, hypoaesthesia of the upper lip and nose and swelling. A tight painful jaw, tearing and redness are present along with a tearing sore eye. They may lose vision for up to 2-30 minutes. Increased pulsing in the carotid artery supplies the headache.\n\nThe headache is extremely intense however it is only unilateral. It may only last 15-20 minutes and may come once or twice a day. They also come on regularly- like cluster bombs- compared with the remaining time the patient may be headache-free for weeks or months. Typically, the patient will experience pain at the same time every evening , night or morning for 4-6 weeks! This gives the patient a fair chance to alter their lifestyle to avoid the trigger factors. The periodicity depends on the vasomotor or autonomic nervous system ( pattern ) of the patient. It differs from person- to -person.\n\nThe headaches are commonly treated with ergot derivatives just prior to onset of the attack and this may set the pattern against which he /she may relapse for a number of years. Often the attacks are triggered by alcohol, cheese, rich food, stress and barometric changes. As these trigger factors usually relate to lifestyle the attacks may be avoided by being aware of the triggers and changing lifestyles.\n\nThe traditional view holds that the brain's vascular is increased in mass causing the dural sheath or the lining of the brain to rupture in some way via reduced blood supply or increase in the volume or pressure - in short - over of the supplied blood. It seems that the nerves and blood vessels are very reactive and errors in their functioning direct the course of these periodic recurrent headaches. These may involve either the cranial nerves - cranial nerves V-VII -or the blood supply to the occipital infarction which lodge in the meninges and the metabolic demands place in the posterior fibres.\n\nIt seems that ergot", "Well, it\u2019s a pain in the ass. For some, yeah you\u2019ve got the cluster. In broad terms, a cluster headache is a single intense pain that affects one of your eyes. It lasts around a minute, but can happen repeatedly for up to 3 months. Yay, though? No. One minute is a lifetime. We define a cluster as being the feeling of death charging head-first into your frontalaina, then (metaphorically) colonising your head, sucking out it\u2019s seeds and leaving it empty? It usually feels warm, but can be sharp and cold and it\u2019s usually very regular. That one minute of agonising anguish can reoccur after a gap of 15-30 minutes for weeks, months or years. It doesn\u2019t really matter, it hurts you right now.\n\nI haven\u2019t had one for a couple of years, so I can\u2019t give you a photo, but someone with a cluster who saw my round of pints post probably thinks I\u2019ve got one now.

My light weight on 3rd day was 120 moderate weight on day e\u307e\u308b was 125.\nwow...i could not have said it better. I did everything right. On time with my meds. Even when I took an extra Clomid on e\u307e\u308b I had a gerghter period then normal. Yet I ended up not getting pregnant. for the second time... What price did you pay o pay for this test? Do you think it matters if you are overweight I am chunky and  really want a baby.... I have no idea what I need to do. I am tempted to get the dream machine but I know it is not as accurate as the Bio. Wish there was a way to know for sure.\n\nI guess we will have to take these results with a grain of salt but I always wonder how many false positives and fake Dinas words to be correct????"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3505, "rouge1_r": 0.0852, "rouge1_f1": 0.1371, "rouge2_p": 0.0521, "rouge2_r": 0.0126, "rouge2_f1": 0.0202, "rougel_p": 0.3093, "rougel_r": 0.0752, "rougel_f1": 0.121, "bleurt": 0.4232, "bert_score_p": 0.7847, "bert_score_r": 0.8124, "bert_score_f1": 0.7983, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.433, "rouge1_r": 0.1129, "rouge1_f1": 0.1791, "rouge2_p": 0.0208, "rouge2_r": 0.0054, "rouge2_f1": 0.0086, "rougel_p": 0.2165, "rougel_r": 0.0565, "rougel_f1": 0.0896, "bleurt": 0.2327, "bert_score_p": 0.7733, "bert_score_r": 0.8078, "bert_score_f1": 0.7901, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.1856, "rouge1_r": 0.1452, "rouge1_f1": 0.1629, "rouge2_p": 0.0417, "rouge2_r": 0.0325, "rouge2_f1": 0.0365, "rougel_p": 0.1134, "rougel_r": 0.0887, "rougel_f1": 0.0995, "bleurt": 0.2147, "bert_score_p": 0.784, "bert_score_r": 0.8198, "bert_score_f1": 0.8015, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.0928, "rouge1_r": 0.25, "rouge1_f1": 0.1353, "rouge2_p": 0.0104, "rouge2_r": 0.0286, "rouge2_f1": 0.0153, "rougel_p": 0.0619, "rougel_r": 0.1667, "rougel_f1": 0.0902, "bleurt": 0.1683, "bert_score_p": 0.8131, "bert_score_r": 0.8095, "bert_score_f1": 0.8113, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.567, "rouge1_r": 0.1407, "rouge1_f1": 0.2254, "rouge2_p": 0.125, "rouge2_r": 0.0308, "rouge2_f1": 0.0494, "rougel_p": 0.2784, "rougel_r": 0.0691, "rougel_f1": 0.1107, "bleurt": 0.2445, "bert_score_p": 0.7873, "bert_score_r": 0.831, "bert_score_f1": 0.8086, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3711, "rouge1_r": 0.1237, "rouge1_f1": 0.1856, "rouge2_p": 0.0312, "rouge2_r": 0.0103, "rouge2_f1": 0.0155, "rougel_p": 0.1959, "rougel_r": 0.0653, "rougel_f1": 0.0979, "bleurt": 0.2492, "bert_score_p": 0.7944, "bert_score_r": 0.8108, "bert_score_f1": 0.8025, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

It\u2019s called critical illness cover on your life insurance. It\u2019s only a handful of conditions such as cancer, heart attack etc. but they will pay up to a set amount directly to you.

You say part of your stomach was removed?? When I had the tumour removed, and it cleared the pathology came clear.\n\nWith regards to medical treatment, they will need proof before passing judgement - and as with anything like that - you need to get at it fast\n\nHave you been refused by everyone else?

By day 2 I woke up with a spring in my step and still have it - 6 months later, 1 once a day for 2 months is boosted to 2 once a day for 2 months 1 month and once weekly for 9 months I am still a patient but there is a hint of de-stressing.

Also, its affected the area at around the back of your jaws (not measured by the amount of dryness, just by where they are right?) and this is completely normal.\nI also suffer from this.\nIt mostly stays at the back, and rarely seems to affect the upper molars, although this is my weakest area. This area is covered by the gum tissue along the back and so stays protected. Recently, I sliced too deep with my gums (last night) and it did affect the upper molars for a little while. This is no real cause for concern though,\nive had a look at my mouth,\nits a really cold soddier in there.\nThe lesion is red and very distinct from the rest of the skin in the area, my teeth are exposed and im draping my tongue over the other bits and pieces, having a good sniff of the blood and realising how intimate an examination i ought to give to this thing.\nHaving a good chuckle to myself, really glad its not cancer, i lick the base of the tongue as the brush or in combination with my tongue cannot get into the crevasse created by my lips and the corner of my sore side of my its generally inside the corner of my \u2018upper lip\u2019 ( due to swelling) possibly affecting the upper molar. This is usually the site, although again I", "I know that oral herpes typically doesn't appear on the chin, but I've noticed this rash on my chin that I think might be a herpes breakout. But I can't tell for sure because it isn't leaving any blisters. It's just this network of red rashes intertwined with each other. I didn't feel a break out coming.\n\nI know that you can have both types of herpes. But the infection can ONLY appear on the lips for type 1 herpes.\nAnd it can only appear on the anus and genitals for type 2 herpes.\n\nCan any of you knowledgable people confirm whether this would be an ordinary cold sore, or herpes? Can it manifest anywhere else on the body but the mouth and genitals? I'd really like to know so I don't do anything stupid :\nThanks so much. Psst... I'm totally clean, so no worries there.\nWell, it's a network of overlapping red rashes. It's not like one big blob. Although the surface areas near the red rash are covered with very obvious individual raised blisters. I was wondering whether when I initially had the infection if the virus colonized on my chin and never left.\nBecause I've never had skin herpes on any part of my body - my anus or on my vaginal muscles. I've only had genital herpes in my vagina and upper inner thighs. So I was wondering if it were possible for it to manifest entirely on your chin.\nJust the same, hopefully the healing process is the same. And if I keep my oral intercourse habits, again, like I always have the past couple years, then I shouldn't need to worry about it reappearing on me again. I do the clench-technique every time I wear chapstick in school even though I know it's impossible for herpes to be anywhere in there, but I worry about a cold sore virus hiding under. But I'm pretty certain that's one thing that I won't get.\nYou think it's just a cold sore issue though? It's just a rash as is just. It has no flatamaran-looking blobs or clumps as cold sores would indeed have. But it's not like what I've normally seen/know from other cold sores.\nHmmm.

It is often referred to as the \"silent infection\" because it can be present in the body without causing any symptoms. However, if left untreated, chlamydia can cause permanent damage to the reproductive system, including infertility.\n\nStep 2/2\nIn some cases, chlamydia can clear up on its own without treatment. However, this is not recommended as it can lead to serious health complications. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have chlamydia, as early treatment can prevent long-term damage. Treatment for chlamydia typically involves antibiotics, which can effectively clear the infection and prevent further damage.

One of the men allegedly put a knife to the throat of the teacher, 64, before they tied her hands and legs. The trio forced her into a storeroom, taking her clothes, keys, bags and mobile phone. She was able to call for assistance, and the men fled the scene before officers arrived.

If the diagnosis is confirmed, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. The type of antibiotic and dosage will depend on the severity of the infection and any underlying health conditions.\n\nStep 3/6\n3. In some cases, the doctor may also recommend pain medication to help relieve the pain and discomfort associated with the infection.

It's important to follow the doctor's instructions carefully and complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if the symptoms improve before the medication is finished. Stopping the medication early can lead to the infection returning or becoming resistant to the antibiotics.\n\nStep 5/6\n5. In addition to medication, there are some home remedies that may help relieve symptoms of a middle ear infection. These include: - Resting and avoiding activities that put pressure on the ears, such as flying or diving. - Using a warm compress on the affected ear to help reduce pain and inflammation. - Using a humidifier to help keep the air moist and reduce congestion. - Avoiding smoking or being around secondhand smoke, as this can worsen the symptoms of a middle ear infection.\n\nStep 6/6\n6.

It is a common vaginal infection that is caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina.\n\nBV is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be passed from one person to another during sex.\n\nBV is not a serious infection, but it can cause unpleasant symptoms and increase the risk of other infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.\n\nBV is not a serious infection, but it can cause unpleasant symptoms and increase the risk of other infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of BV?\n\nThe symptoms of BV can vary from person to person, but they often include:\n\n* a thin, white or gray discharge from the vagina\n* a strong, fishy smell\n* itching or burning around the vagina\n* pain during sex\n* a burning sensation when urinating\n\nThese symptoms can be similar to those of other vaginal infections, so it is important to see a doctor if you have any concerns.\n\nHow is BV treated?\n\nBV is usually treated with antibiotics. The most common antibiotics used to treat BV are metronidazole and clindamycin.\n\nThese antibiotics can be taken as a pill or as a cream or gel that is inserted into the vagina.\n\nIt is important to finish the full course of antibiotics, even if the symptoms go away before the treatment is finished.\n\nIf you have BV, you should also avoid having sex until the infection has cleared up.\n\nWhat are the risks of BV?\n\nBV can increase the risk of other infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. It can also increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in pregnant women.\n\nIf you have BV, you should tell your doctor or midwife so that they can monitor your pregnancy and provide you with the best care.\n\nHow can I prevent BV?\n\nThere is no sure way to prevent BV, but there are some things that you can do to reduce your risk.\n\nThese include:\n\n* using condoms during sex\n* avoiding douching\n* wearing cotton underwear\n* avoiding scented products, such as tampons and pads\n* avoiding tight-fitting clothing\n\nIf you have BV, you should also avoid having sex until the infection has cleared up.\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of BV?\n\nBV is not a serious infection, but it can cause unpleasant symptoms and increase the risk of other infections.\n\nIf you have BV, you should see a doctor so that they can provide you", "One of the most common questions that I am asked by patients who have bacterial vaginosis (BV) is \u201cis BV an STD?\u201d Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there on this question, and patients tend to come in with some thinking it might be, and others are coming in with the expectation that it\u2019s not.\n\nBV is not an STD, but THAT DOES NOT MEAN that it is not related to STDs. These two diseases are intrinsically linked, and understanding the relationship between them is crucial.\n\nThe first aspect of the relationship is simpler to understand, and that\u2019s the fact that BV increases a person\u2019s risk for acquiring STDs. This is why many public health agencies are quick to say, \u201cNo, BV is not an STD\u201d\n\nHowever, the converse is not true: if you have an STD, you are not more likely to have BV. However, that does not mean that they are completely disassociated, and it is more accurate to say that your existing or recent infections may contribute to the development of BV at some point in the future.\n\nThis is unfortunate, but that\u2019s the way it is. The reason that I am bothered by the concept that diseases like chlamydia are more likely to cause the development of BV (as opposed to making an existing case of BV worse) is that arguments about the absence of multiple causality are pointless.\n\nAs a physician who sees these patients every day, it is self-evident to me that patients who are being treated for an STD have a more favorable clinical course of treatment for BV. I am not one of those physicians who believe that everything one does is a variable that impacts the outcome of their treatment. I am much more appreciative of the fact that we can save money by identifying multiple disease processes when they arise.\n\nSo, when someone asks me whether BV is an STD, my answer is: While it is not, it is extremely related to the acquisition of STDs, and when you have an STD, you are definitely at a higher risk of developing BV.", "Bacterial Vaginosis or BV is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria\n\nwhen these \u2018bad\u2019 bacteria (things like L.

One day when changing out his boxer briefs\n\nthere were a little bits of blood in the underwear.\n\nWe sort of freaked at that point and put a lot of pressure on him to get tested.\n\nHis doctor, however was not at all concerned by the symptoms he had described,\n\nwas convinced that he had it correctly diagnosed but that they were in fact due to some dry skin.\n\nOver the coming months, both of us swung into action to contact the various sexual partners\n\ntrying to get information about their own health,\n\nbut we could never really get a clear picture of if that ruled out the possibility completely.\n\nAnd his girlfriend\u2019s lack of the same symptoms has convinced that even if they weren\u2019t lying,\n\nwe that they just didn\u2019t have it themselves.\n\nHe was really feeling pressured and feeling from everyone that he thought he needed to go into getting tested.\n\nThey invited several of their friends to have an informal chat about it and we went to that.\n\nEverybody sort of downplayed it and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go ahead and get some other tests done to see get a complete dump of what\u2019s going on\n\nIncluding a Pelvic exam for the lady one.\u201d\n\nAnd this was very valuable because we were able to get some partners to step up and say, \u201cHey, Yeah, I would be willing to be tested.\u201d", "RE: are walking shoes covered by insurance\n\nANY advice or specific for EVERYTHING you want you'll need for walking the Camino?

However, the condition can occur as a complication of a sexually transmitted disease. If you begin experiencing very abnormal discharge after becoming sexually active, then consult the doctor immediately. Your doctor might administer a culture or microscopic test to detect the problem.\n\n<h2>Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Can Occur Because of Bacteria That In Your Vagina</h2>\n\n* it\u2019s not an STD\n* it\u2019s uncomfortable, but not dangerous\n* It doesn\u2019t cause infertility\n* It can cause odor\n* It can cause more odor\n\n<h2>But The Clever Part Of Bacterial Vaginosis is</h2>\n\nIt changes your vaginal bacteria and keeps it going for about a week longer than normal; it can cause vaginal bacterial to grow in tiny sections, also usually alone, but another type of bacteria, Trichomonas vaginalis, could be causing this issue as well. This change, however, is far from permanent. It can be treated with a topical antibiotic cream or ointment.\n\nThe symptoms can even mirror sexually transmitted diseases. For example, whitish vaginal discharge can look like the STD Chlamydia. But bacterial vaginosis is not an STD, and that means you can\u2019t catch it from another person. This condition happens when bacteria found naturally in your vagina reside together.\n\n<h3>Here are five things you ought to know about bacterial vaginosis:</h3>\n\n1. <strong>It\u2019s not an STD.</strong> And it can\u2019t pass on to anyone who isn\u2019t you. This condition happens because of several types of bacteria join together, but you\u2019re not projecting it to someone you have sex with, only to sexual frustration or even too much sex happens, particularly in the case of women who have had intercourse several times in a short time.\n2. <strong>Pregnancy.</strong> Women who have this situation are more susceptible to get a malfunction that can cause them to have a premature birth or a miscarriage.\n3. <strong>It can flush out the good bacteria.</strong> The lousy bacteria that are overrunning according to remove the awesome bacteria in your vagina, which keeps the pH level balanced and also permits you to have regular vaginal fluids.\n4. <strong>It can make your discharge odour worse.</strong> Your discharge is normal if you have no taste. But it could be a little bit more offensive. It\u2019s also natural in a way, and it can explain to you the way you feel.\n5. <strong>It gets far more unpleasant when you have sex.</strong> More mucous, yet"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5747, "rouge1_r": 0.1222, "rouge1_f1": 0.2016, "rouge2_p": 0.1628, "rouge2_r": 0.0343, "rouge2_f1": 0.0567, "rougel_p": 0.4253, "rougel_r": 0.0905, "rougel_f1": 0.1492, "bleurt": 0.3781, "bert_score_p": 0.7929, "bert_score_r": 0.8439, "bert_score_f1": 0.8176, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4483, "rouge1_r": 0.1086, "rouge1_f1": 0.1749, "rouge2_p": 0.1047, "rouge2_r": 0.0251, "rouge2_f1": 0.0405, "rougel_p": 0.3103, "rougel_r": 0.0752, "rougel_f1": 0.1211, "bleurt": 0.3038, "bert_score_p": 0.7977, "bert_score_r": 0.8136, "bert_score_f1": 0.8056, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5402, "rouge1_r": 0.1135, "rouge1_f1": 0.1876, "rouge2_p": 0.1047, "rouge2_r": 0.0218, "rouge2_f1": 0.0361, "rougel_p": 0.3448, "rougel_r": 0.0725, "rougel_f1": 0.1198, "bleurt": 0.2555, "bert_score_p": 0.7856, "bert_score_r": 0.8371, "bert_score_f1": 0.8105, "hallucination": 88.88888888888889, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4483, "rouge1_r": 0.0973, "rouge1_f1": 0.1598, "rouge2_p": 0.0581, "rouge2_r": 0.0125, "rouge2_f1": 0.0206, "rougel_p": 0.2414, "rougel_r": 0.0524, "rougel_f1": 0.0861, "bleurt": 0.214, "bert_score_p": 0.7695, "bert_score_r": 0.7933, "bert_score_f1": 0.7812, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3448, "rouge1_r": 0.082, "rouge1_f1": 0.1325, "rouge2_p": 0.0465, "rouge2_r": 0.011, "rouge2_f1": 0.0177, "rougel_p": 0.2299, "rougel_r": 0.0546, "rougel_f1": 0.0883, "bleurt": 0.2435, "bert_score_p": 0.7525, "bert_score_r": 0.7772, "bert_score_f1": 0.7646, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.6092, "rouge1_r": 0.1274, "rouge1_f1": 0.2107, "rouge2_p": 0.1279, "rouge2_r": 0.0265, "rouge2_f1": 0.0439, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.0697, "rougel_f1": 0.1153, "bleurt": 0.2885, "bert_score_p": 0.7922, "bert_score_r": 0.8323, "bert_score_f1": 0.8118, "hallucination": 55.55555555555556, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

They can be a sign of nerve or adrenal gland problems, or a kidney problem. They can also happen if you\u2019re dehydrated. See what your doctor says. If the reason your docs request you take quetiapine is linked with something that causes brain damage, such as Alzheimer\u2019s-it is worth suffering the hiccups and try to reduce or get off the drugs that are causing your hiccups. You can get prescription bordmein (permission from your doctor) or Meck 02 f\u00e6rdige, 1-2 tablets 3 times a day to keep your bowels moving and without side effect. This will stop the urgency to go all the time, and maybe reduce the hiccups.

It would be most likely found in the left kidney, but may also be present in the right kidney.", "if no, is there any test (fast/reliable) in detecting kidney stones?\n\nAnswer:  \n\nStep 1/2\n1] Kidney stones are formed in kidneys. If the stone is small in size, it may get dissolved in body fluids or may be passed out in urine without any symptoms. If the stone is big in size, it may not be passed out easily, and symptoms like pain, burning sensation during urination, and nausea may occur.\n\nStep 2/2\n2] To detect kidney stones, some tests are done, like : a) Urine routine examination : A routine urinalysis examines the physical, chemical, and microscopic characteristics of urine. It is used to detect any abnormalities in the urine, which can help diagnose various urinary tract problems like kidney stones. b) Imaging studies : Imaging studies like ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, and X-ray can be used to detect kidney stones. c) Blood tests : Blood tests can be used to check kidney function and detect any problems like infection or inflammation. So, to answer your question : standard urinalysis would not always detect kidney stones. If the stone is small in size and asymptomatic, it may not show up in urine routine examination. However, if the stone is big or causing symptoms, then urine routine examination and other tests mentioned above may be helpful in detecting it.
