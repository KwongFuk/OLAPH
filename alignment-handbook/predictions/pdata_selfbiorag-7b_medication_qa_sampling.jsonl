{"Question": "what is barbiturates", "Free_form_answer": "Barbiturates are sedative-hypnotic drugs that were once commonly used as sedatives or antianxiety medications. A physician must prescribe barbiturates; otherwise, their use is considered illicit. Among their limited uses, barbiturates are used to manage some seizure disorders as well as for pre-procedural sedation. In rarer instances, they are prescribed for the treatment of headache, anxiety and insomnia. However, their use in most areas of medicine has largely been supplanted by other safer medications. Barbiturates are controlled substances due to the potential they pose for abuse, physical dependence, and addiction. Some of the more common barbiturates include     Luminal (phenobarbital).

During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced.How insulin works\nDuring digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin.The insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals.||How glucagon works\nGlucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.About four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon.

Adams, an assistant professor of internal medicine at Wake Forest University.\nGabapentin works by targeting the central nervous system instead of the peripheral nervous system, where morphine and iodine exert their effects.\nAdams noted that gabapentin has some important advantages over morphine and iodine. \"It doesn't have the significant side effects and risks associated with these medications,\" he said.\nThe study was conducted on 25 patients with morphine or iodine allergies who had neuropathic pain. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group received gabapentin, and the other group received a placebo.\nThe researchers found that the patients who took gabapentin experienced a significant reduction in their neuropathic pain symptoms.\n\"This study suggests that gabapentin might be a viable alternative for treating neuropathic pain in patients who have morphine or iodine allergies,\" Adams added.\nThe findings are scheduled for publication in the April issue of the journal Pain Medicine.\n\"This is a promising alternative for patients with morphine or iodine allergies who need treatment for neuropathic pain,\" Adams concluded. \"Further studies are needed to see how long-term use of gabapentin compares with the use of morphine or iodine.\"", "# ANTAGONISTS: compounds that block the action of the agonist at a particular receptor. everybody is asking about the counter ion (free ion) in case of antagonist. remember that when an agonist binds to its receptor,their combined ionic (Charge) remain the same. so, if you are asking about the ionic (charge) of the combined agonist and antagonist, just add their individual charges. if you are asking about the net ionic (charge) of the agonist or antagonist, just subtract the individual charges.

{"Question": "is peppermint oil safe in mouthwash?", "Free_form_answer": "Peppermint oil appears to be safe when taken orally (by mouth) in the doses commonly used. Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.     Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.     Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.     Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation.

Several studies reviewing conversion of gabapentin to pregabalin predict that a rough ratio for conversion is about 6:1 gabapentin to pregabalin.

{"Question": "what antidepressants are best for someone with a heart arrhythmia", "Free_form_answer": "A research team at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital has verified that several antidepressants may increase the risk of a potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbance (arrhythmia). By examining the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 38,000 people taking 11 different antidepressants, they confirmed that higher doses of citalopram (Celexa), amitriptyline (Elavil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) were associated with a slight disruption of the electrical function of the heart. This delay as seen on an ECG is known as a prolonged Q-T interval, and it is a risk factor for an arrhythmia that causes sudden death. Although the majority of people with this ECG abnormality never develop an arrhythmia, the researchers cautioned that people taking these antidepressants should discuss the risk with their doctor. The researchers emphasized that no one with a history of arrhythmias should start taking these medications. Instead, such a patient might try one of the antidepressants that do not increase the Q-T interval: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), or buproprion (Wellbutrin).

{"Question": "how does it take phentermine to clear a drug screen?", "Free_form_answer": "Since phentermine has a similar structure to amphetamines, a urine drug screen can test positive for amphetamines. This will signal the need for a confirmatory test, which will then show that it was phentermine and not amphetamine or methamphetamine. The original result will then be ruled a false positive. If you have a prescription for phentermine, you should disclose that to the testing lab so your results can be appropriately interpreted. Phentermine is likely to be detected in the urine for one to four days after a dose, up to 24 hours in the blood, and up to one month in hair tests. The amount of phentermine detected in tests and how long it stays in your system is dependent on a number of factors. These include your age, the dose and how long you've been taking it, and your metabolism.

{"Question": "is peppermint oil safe in \"mouth wash?\"", "Free_form_answer": "Peppermint oil appears to be safe when taken orally (by mouth) in the doses commonly used. Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.     Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.     Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.     Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation.

{"Question": "amiodarone for afibwhat are side effects", "Free_form_answer": "Adverse reactions have been very common in virtually all series of patients treated with amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias with relatively large doses of drug (400 mg/day and above), occurring in about three-fourths of all patients and causing discontinuation in 7 to 18%. The most serious reactions are pulmonary toxicity, exacerbation of arrhythmia, and rare serious liver injury (see \u201cWARNINGS\u201d), but other adverse effects constitute important problems. They are often reversible with dose reduction or cessation of amiodarone treatment. Most of the adverse effects appear to become more frequent with continued treatment beyond six months, although rates appear to remain relatively constant beyond one year. The time and dose relationships of adverse effects are under continued study.Neurologic problems are extremely common, occurring in 20 to 40% of patients and including malaise and fatigue, tremor and involuntary movements, poor coordination and gait, and peripheral neuropathy; they are rarely a reason to stop therapy and may respond to dose reductions or discontinuation (see \u201cPRECAUTIONS\u201d). There have been spontaneous reports of demyelinating polyneuropathy.Gastrointestinal complaints, most commonly nausea, vomiting, constipation, and anorexia, occur in about 25% of patients but rarely require discontinuation of drug. These commonly occur during high-dose administration (i.e., loading dose) and usually respond to dose reduction or divided doses.Ophthalmic abnormalities including optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, in some cases progressing to permanent blindness, papilledema, corneal degeneration, photosensitivity, eye discomfort, scotoma, lens opacities, and macular degeneration have been reported (see \u201cWARNINGS\u201d).Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits are present in virtually all adult patients who have been on drug for more than 6 months. Some patients develop eye symptoms of halos, photophobia, and dry eyes. Vision is rarely affected and drug discontinuation is rarely needed.Dermatological adverse reactions occur in about 15% of patients, with photosensitivity being most common (about 10%).

{"Question": "how does cocaine i effect the nervous system", "Free_form_answer": "Cocaine is an illegal stimulant drug that affects your central nervous system. Cocaine comes from the coca plant. When used, cocaine causes the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some chemicals.

{"Question": "how is tocilizumab administered", "Free_form_answer": "Tocilizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) in your arm by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital outpatient clinic or as a prefilled syringe to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) by yourself at home. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given once every 2 weeks. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat cytokine release syndrome, it is usually given once, but up to 3 additional doses may be given at least 8 hours apart. It will take about 1 hour for you to receive your dose of tocilizumab injection intravenously. When tocilizumab is given subcutaneously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or giant cell arteritis, it is usually given once weekly or once every other week.You will receive your first subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab injection in your doctor's office. If you will be injecting tocilizumab injection subcutaneously by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, your doctor will show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should also read the written instructions for use that come with the medication.Thirty minutes before you are ready to inject tocilizumab injection, you will need to remove the medication from the refrigerator, take it out of its carton, and allow it to reach room temperature. When removing a prefilled syringe from the box, be careful not to touch the trigger fingers on the syringe. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in warm water, or through any other method.Do not remove the cap from the prefilled syringe while the medication is warming. You should remove the cap no more than 5 minutes before you inject the medication. Do not replace the cap after you remove it. Do not use the syringe if you drop it on the floor.Check the prefilled syringe to be sure that the expiration date printed on the package has not passed, Holding the syringe with the covered needle pointing down, look closely at the liquid in the syringe. The liquid should be clear or pale yellow and should not be cloudy or discolored or contain lumps or particles. Call your pharmacist if there are any problems with the package or the syringe and do not inject the medication.You may inject tocilizumab injection on the front of the thighs or anywhere on your stomach except your navel (belly button) and the area 2 inches around it. If another person is injecting your medication, the outer area of the upper arms also may be used. Do not inject the medication into skin that is tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact, or that has scars, moles, or bruises. Choose a different spot each time you inject the medication, at least 1 inch away from a spot that you have used before.

Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide. The increased mortality in women receiving oral steroid medication was found to be associated with an increased need of hospital care due to longer hospital stays during the terminal stage of the disease. When analysing effects and side-effects of steroid medication in COPD, the possibility of sex-related differences should be considered.", "Must_have": ["Oxygen therapy is associated with improved survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypoxaemia.", "Oral steroid medication has been linked to improved survival in men, increased mortality in women, and an increase in the rate of exacerbation.", "Increased need of hospital care was predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication."], "Nice_to_have": ["Fluticasone can be used alongside oxygen therapy, but it's essential for healthcare providers to monitor the patient's situation as there may be considerations particularly in female patients.", "Steroid medication, including fluticasone, may have differential effects depending on the sex of the patient.", "Inhaled steroid medication has been linked with a reduction in exacerbation rate in patients with COPD.", "Advanced age and poor performance status are predictors of increased need for hospital care in COPD patients.", "In women, oral steroid treatment has been associated with increased mortality during long-term oxygen therapy.", "Increased hospital stays in COPD patients, particularly women receiving oral steroid medication, can occur during the terminal stage of the disease."], "sample_predictions": ["Yes, you can use fluticasone while using oxygen. Oxygen is a good solution for getting rid of mucosal irritation caused by inhalation steroids. Oxygen also helps to prevent or treat any oral candidiasis that might result from inhalation steroids.
