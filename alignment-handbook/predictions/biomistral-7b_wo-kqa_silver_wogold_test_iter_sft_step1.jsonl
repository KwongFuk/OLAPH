Emerging evidence from studies in late 2020 show that coronavirus RNA persists in some lingering symptoms (e.g depression, fatigue) affecting the individuals for up to 12 weeks after symptoms onset. However, this RNA is rarely or not present in individuals who do not develop symptoms during the acute phase of illness. A study in healthy individuals by Xu et al . showed that no live virus (cell-cultured test) could be isolated from swab samples of seronegative healthy individuals.

In the USA, more than 250, 000 ovarian cystectomies are performed yearly that could be avoided by applying the medical treatment. The ideal therapy for a disturbing symptomatic ovarian cyst is rapid deflation of the cyst. However, before choosing the therapeutic plan, it is important and imperative to establish the ovarian cyst diagnosis with accurate imaging techniques. Currently, there is a consensus between specialists on using the imaging methods for diagnosis of WHO stage I as well as II cysts. By ovarian cyst aspiration and drainage and laparoscopy or laparotomy the favourable therapeutic results are expected.(ACOG 2000) . Though laparoscopic cystectomy has been the standard procedure for many patients with unruptured ovarian cysts significant long-term data regarding rupture and recurrence after cystectomy is unavailable."}

{"text": "Question: Is it possible to get antibiotics? \n ### Answer: Can the lack of oxygen or of nutrients be solved by the application of modern imaging? Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 demonstrate the hasty formation of larger necrotic regions, which impairs viability. Moreover, it generates an oxygen and glucose depleted environment, which permits bacterial proliferation. This yields surface formation, where the pathogens can, once more, adhere to the heart surface. Translating these three key events to three different areas, the tumor, the wound and hematogenous spread, cancer is once more comparable to the effect of sepsis. First, while a tumor grows in size, the solid tumor, as opposed to the liquid part of the human body, remains relatively hypoxic . The process of hypoxia, while very similar (loss of oxygen), is distinguished by different means to achieve it . Second, apart from the difference in inflicted infection site, a longer period of time is needed to trigger hypoxic effects ."}

{"text": "Question: What do you think is causing this allergic reaction? \n ### Answer: Most patients with allergic reactions associate food exposure with food allergy. Although past exposure to ingested wheat does not always provoke an IgE-mediated reaction, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) has been associated with exercise following exposure to wheat . FDEIA is a form of food-dependent anaphylaxis, which has been defined as an exercise-induced IgE-mediated reaction that occurs reproducibly after ingestion of a specific food . Studies have also reported that wheat also elicits atopic eczema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis . Wheat allergy may present in atopic patients with both gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement . Furthermore, occupationally provoked wheat allergy may resemble occupational asthma or chronic baker\u2019s lung . Clinicians should ask questions to identify patient\u2019s allergic triggers that include what they have ingested, what time of the day it occurred, and what was going on (e.g. exercise, occupational exposures, or medications). Some medications may increase wheat allergy or other food reactions, such as alpha-adrenergic blocking agents or antihistamines . Accordingly, this patient had wheat allergy associated with exercise (wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis; WD-EIA). Wheat-dependent, food-dependent atopic dermatitis, wheat-dependent, food-dependent urticaria, and wheat and/or aniseed sensitivity as manifestations of wheat allergy have also been described in the literature ."}

Also, urinary signs are a symptom not a diagnosis and the urinalysis and uroculture were normal.

Postnasal drip means a flow rate of 0.05 to 5ul per minute. A nasal passage without postnatal drip is defined as no flow rate. Not even 1 event during 2hrs of recording is documented as a postnatal drip. This is ridiculous; the patients suffer from disease, and the authors report normal nasal passage!

{"text": "Question: Cyclobenzaprine? \n ### Answer: g homogenhanoside was identified as a degradation product of H-2 . Due to a lack of data, its toxicological profile is not fully understood. While this compound has not been identified in the ACU-LAB extracts, it is probably present in low amounts, as non-polar compounds are not retained by the analytical cartridge (Strata-X PubChem Tower 1 g, 3 mL). The way in which the compounds are extracted depends on the intended use."}
{"text": "Question: Will it go away on its own or do I need antibiotics? \n ### Answer: This is a question that is asked by patients and physicians alike. The answer is not always clear. The decision to prescribe antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis is not always straightforward. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) have published guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The IDSA guidelines are based on a systematic review of the literature and expert opinion. The AAO-HNS guidelines are based on a systematic review of the literature and expert opinion, as well as a Delphi process with experts in the field. Both guidelines recommend that antibiotics should be reserved for patients with severe disease or those at high risk for complications."}

(Int 6)Individuals may have suggested differing causes of specific whereas their HPs could link them to a common stressor. For example, low mood and fatigue are familiar symptoms to a person with MS, but their presentation may lead individuals to conclude their effects are exhaustion, loss of bone density or an upset stomach, which are only indirectly linked to MS in experiential terms (Table 4).The overarching theme is of a disparate and confusing repertoire of symptoms and problems described by individuals, attributing them to highly specific causes or varied more general issues, experimental evidence of a connection to MS and the experience of an HP to causal connections arising from a common source. There is a very mixed experience of how MS-related symptoms, problems and losses may be viewed, understood and communicated. Three main subthemes are described in relation to HPs' communication with individuals."}

Within steroid usage, dexamethasone is far more potent than MPS derivatives (methylprednisolone or prednisone), proven by Schmitt and colleagues; this means that other MPS derivatives (prednisone or meprednisolone) will also not have the same effect on the expression of IL-6/TNF\u03b1. The question of steroids in COVID-19, and especially in the early phase of viral replication and cytokine biosynthesis, has not been sufficiently investigated and requires further research, and thus, the question is still open."}

{"text": "Question: Can i replace Naproxen by paracetamol? \n ### Answer: Studies suggest that any significant antipyretic effect of paracetamol is lost by 4 hours after oral or rectal administration. As naproxen also requires 4\u20135 hours for peak effect, concurrent administration of paracetamol and naproxen will have additional benefit, but the answer is not this simple as there are significant pharmacological differences between paracetamol and naproxen in relation to their site of action, and thus their antipyretic effect. Paracetamol lowers pyrogenic cytokine production and acts as a centrally mediated antipyretic drug. Naproxen on the other hand, is a centrally acting antipyretic drug and a peripherally acting cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. The interactions between paracetamol and naproxen are poorly studied and there is only little information regarding this issue. The architecture of the molecules and resultant physical and pharmacological properties of these drugs imply that there may be an interaction, but that has not been proved scientifically. Until further research provides us with convincing results it is better to refrain from combining paracetamol with naproxen, simply because it is of no use."}

{"text": "Question: Does Effexor cause weight gain? \n ### Answer: (Response) I found some discrepancies between the response and information in the text cited as the source. It is unclear whether the weight gain cited by the authors (3.4 lbs) refers to weight gain in women or men or the entire population of patients in the study. Furthermore, if the patients were weighed in their clothes and the numbers reported represent weight in lbs, then one would expect an even greater weight gain among the patients in the study (For instance, a patient who reported 17.5 pounds weight gain, per the NDC census, would have an additional pound of weight gain if they had been weighed without their clothes.). Also, one has to wonder about the effectiveness of treatment in those patients that experienced no change in weight because their previous treatment strategy was reported as having failed. It seems reasonable that the treatment course would be more effective in those patients. In fact, there is another article (this one exploring antidepressant use and weight) and this paper and the text cited (a paragraph from a longer article) refer to a 9.8 lbs gain in a population of women and men experiencing antidepressant treatment in an uncontrolled situation. Although the answers to my questions are not directly addressed in the cited published article (a 2005 archival issue of the NEJM), the issues I have raised are important ones given the implications for the health of both male and female patients and should not be overlooked in any large data analyses. I also found it interesting that the authors reported the weight gain numbers for Roxy as a single finding but then reported the weight gain with Effexor as a combined number for the XR and IR formulations. Finally, the immediate weight gain and loss mentioned by the authors referred to the time after initiation of the course of treatment or shortly after the time the patient was started on the antidepressant. Does that capture only the short-term weight change or the long-term weight change? It seems to be the short-term but if one deciphers the references the references refer to longer-term use."}

Nevertheless, they continue treating themselves with Sudafed, not realizing the potentially deleterious consequences of noncompliance.

{"text": "Question: Do I need an antibiotic? \n ### Answer: Is this symptom of my asthma? The aetiology present in this study assured the presence of pathogenic agents unproductive to asthmatics. Any other aetiology that will infect patients with asthma will yield a different pattern and subsequently produce systemic complications, especially when this infection will not be taken care of promptly. The Alcian blue stain done is a clinical method done in diagnosing respiratory epithelial cells and mucin. From samples taken from patients with asthma, there is a decrease in the size and the number of goblet cells that are adequate in normal samples. This can significantly change the consistency of the airway mucous secretion . It may, therefore, give rise to dysfunctional mucous secretions, causing asthma and a preceding condition such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pneumoniae or inflammation of the intrinsic airways or disease of the pulmonary vasculature which may lead to ventilation and perfusion mismatching and end-organ dysfunction (pulmonary hypertension) thus causing asthma or the disease itself, managing asthma, as well as not treating this condition or creating an unabiding environment for other pathogens to colonise in . This inspection of goblet cells assessment may become more important as the basis for controlling asthma becomes addressed."}

I ask because usually the nausea can come from the benadryl and it could have been a side effect of taking both meds together.

That being said, cannabis has strong psychophysiological effects (meaning mostly done through the brain and it\u2019s connections which isn\u2019t equivalent to a placebo effect) which while being more potent is also more likely to trigger a withdrawal response in this case.

{"text": "Question: What is the numbing gel? \n ### Answer: Numbing gel is usually used to relieve pain, sometimes in combination with a local anesthetic, used as an ointment or spray to relieve pain from hemorrhoids, anal fissures, minor burns, or other skin irritations, and also used to relieve pain during medical procedures.10 Lidocaine gel is one of the varieties of numbing gels, which is a local anesthetic. Lidocaine is an amide-derived local anesthetic that commonly acts via a voltage-gated sodium channel blockade, which prevents the generation and propagation of the neural action potential. It exhibits a duration of action significantly longer than that of cocaine17 Cocaine usually remains effective for 1to 30 minutes11,12 and its action starts after 10 to 15 minutes, it has the shortest local action time as compared to other types of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine and lidocaine. But orthodontic tooth movement starts weeks after force is applied, this obviously had the lower thermal pinpoint as the primary intraoral stimulus for pain sensation; on the other hand, Bitche warmed intraoral pinprick higher thermal threshold raises the primary stimulus for pain sensation.11,13 Regarding acute pain, the maximum score of pain intensity was initially observed 1 hour after activating forces and an increase in pain was persistent for 3 days, followed by a plateau phase up to 1 month. Therefore, the local anesthetic effect may be important only for the first 24 hours after force activation and beyond that, the analgesic effect of lidocaine masked by ongoing orthodontic tooth movement.13 Previous studies on painful effects of orthodontic tooth movement using force strawberry had shown that it was painful for the first 24 to 48 hours after applying the force but painDuration was adjusted in agreement with forces applied and the area of occlusion.14 Various studies had shown that acute pain during the initial and early phases of orthodontic tooth movement is common and the use of local anesthetics is confounded by analgesia, although the liquid in the end and holding resins used by many patients may help reduce pain.14 Although techniques such as oral sedation are suggested for neuropathic pain which is more"}

{"text": "Question: Can a sinus infection be caused by bad allergies? \n ### Answer: When an individual has allergies, it is common for them to also experience a stuffy or runny nose. The decongestants and antihistamines used to treat these symptoms can often contribute to a condition called rhinitis medicamentosa, meaning that the nasal passages are constantly swollen due to overuse of medications. Since the nasal passages are a part of the sinuses, chronic swelling and inflammation can interfere with proper drainage of the sinuses. This condition can cause some discomfort in the sinus area, often similar to sinus pressure in individuals with a respiratory infection. However, rhinitis medicamentosa is often misdiagnosed as sinusitis due to the chronic, uncomfortable nature of the condition . Additionally, seasonal allergies can often mimic an acute infection due to initial inflammation of the sinus passages. However, with seasonal allergies, that inflammation will often resolve as the allergies get better over time."}

{"text": "Question: Is an antiviral an option? \n ### Answer: Antiviral therapy has shown some activity, mostly against enterovirus-stimulated vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), which produce a ribosome entry activator. This antiviral activity has been demonstrated in culture and in a few small case series . Cyclosporine, which is used to treat graft-versus-host diseases, was shown good activity against CMV  but no reports were found for DHAV-1 and FHAV-4 related infections. Another approach could be to block the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway given that it mediates the inflammatory response in DHAV-1 infection . Alternatively, a repurposed molecule available to the veterinary profession could be used; one logical example would be recombinant IFN-\u03b1."}

{"text": "Question: Is panic attacks because of the anxiety? \n ### Answer: or vice versa? or both?\nThe relationships between panic attacks, anxiety, and depression are complex. Anxiety and panic can be the cause of depressive symptoms, or depression can lead to anxiety and panic attacks, or both can occur simultaneously (8). True panic disorder is commonly associated with other anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) (9). Therefore, the distinction between agoraphobia and panic disorder is important in the management and treatment of patients. Agoraphobia is a powerful anxiety disorder and very life-limiting (10). People with agoraphobia are usually very aware that their anxiety is caused by objects and places, this is often referred to as anticipated fear. In anticipation of an anxiety-causing object or place, your heart races, tremors, nausea, sweating, dizziness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a snapping feeling of fear and terror (11)."}

{"text": "Question: Is benzonatate an antibiotuc? \n ### Answer: We did not explore the distribution of chromosomes between the cells in the sick cultures to determine whether this could be the case, but our results from culture experiments with E. coli 1759 suggested that this was not the case. However, we found occasional cell death inherent in the sick cultures, which correlated well with the appearance of nuclear material in the media over the course of our experiments. This observation suggests that there may be other phenotypic characteristics for the sick cells or, perhaps alternatively, the NMDA receptor is needed for aspects of bacterial physiology other than metabolic activity. Further experiments will be required to characterize the relationship between NMDA receptor and benzonatate sensitivity, and to more thoroughly explore the mechanisms for the growth arrest/death phenotype and the specific role of NMDA receptor activity in these processes."}

The infiltrate, measured with a pleural effusion, was exceeding the infiltration level that could be explained with an unilateral pneumonic infiltration. A fibrebronchoscopy with a broncho-alveolar lavage could have been a relay on the right lane and would have been a special option, also a search for intra pleural specimen could have been valuable, but this procedure is not part of our therapeutical standards. The setting up from this maneuver was possible, however due to patient's problems and expected uncomfortable procedure the likelihood to set up this routinely was low.

Many attempts have been made to identify the cause of acute pink eye, but few have succeeded.1,3 Some eye drops labeled as ocular or ophthalmic antipruritic may be used during an outbreak to help alleviate symptoms and reduce virus transmission, such as artificial or sterile tears with or without antihistamine, or eye drops for dry eye or allergies.

If, however, individuals do not have the opportunity to receive a treatment, they will report less radiating, higher intensity, and higher prevalence of pain in the affected body part (Bilgin-Ozkan et al., 2010). This \u2018treatment-no-treatment\u2019 impact on pain experience has been labelled nocebo effect and is defined according to Mazur et al. (2004) as pain in the absence of noxious stimulation, that is brought on byColors have different cultural meanings. Pain is frequently correlated with negative colours, such as dark red, burgundy, or black. The difference in selection of certain colours between cultures suggests that people also associate different phenomena with certain colours. Depending on what languages people speak, the concept of corporal suffering seems to be related to colors of different quality. (p. 76).four colours: blue, red, yellow, and brown (Mazur et al., 2004).Nevertheless, pain reporting might not only be an effect of culture-specific expectations or beliefs; the linguistic encoding of pain, or the concepts which languages offer for the description of sensations might also impact the pain experience (S\u00e1nchez-Ardila and Segovia-Mullor, 2010). People\u2019s concepts of feelings and sensations are constructed and communicated with the aid of a symbolic system, the language. Moreover, people use language both to explore and to experience their feelings. The same idea can be expressed in different linguistic forms; but the choice of a given linguistic form may change the nature of the experience. In other words, language use is actively shaping lived experiences and feelings, instead of merely reporting them (Bruner, 1990, p. 67). In this context, the linguistic encoding of pain is crucial because it shapes and modifies the pain experience. Pain, in the sense of acute suffering, is experienced as an acute exacerbation of a chronic disease, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, while in other cases, chronic pain develops after a primary"}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything other then zofran that can be used for nausea? \n ### Answer: Fentanyl is given prior to induction but it still seems like the most likely cause of the nausea in my mind. I am less concerned that it would have a significant impact on ICU length of stay but it would be typical length of stay. Why was the patient unable to be extubated until post operative day one? Was this a function of sedation, or what? It seems that the fentanyl infusion was associated with the difficulty backwards, and that Nausea could play a minor role. The fentanyl, at least, seems to have been the driving force for this issue."}
{"text": "Question: Would antibiotics help? \n ### Answer: FISH has revealed the extent of the gastrointestinal IBD inflammation is associated with the epithelium (Mason, Matsuoka, Yamane, Sueldo, & Abraham, 2015). The studies on HNF4a are suggestive that antibiotics could potentially help. However, mice do not appear to develop cronically active colitis, unlike humans. It may, therefore, be interesting to administer azithromycin (a long\u2010term proposed antibiotic) as an inflammatory modulator (Gordon & Vantarianen, 2012). MFSFAI syndrome may be different to classical adenomatous polyps, but not causing cancer makes it less of a concern."}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything with lidocaine that would be appropriate? \n ### Answer: Is this likely to cause a QTc? There very well may be some effect [as it blocks all cardiac sodium channels], but it may not be a real big concern. You know, it depends on the time of administration. If you\u2019re talking about around the time of a CMR scan, I\u2019m less sure that this is going to be that concerning from the standpoint of potentially exacerbating a long QT. I do think lidocaine would be OK for fascial block and other extra cardiac blocks. However, you\u2019re going to see multiple different practitioners in [the] MRI environment and you may not have that choice of injection site. That would be my first concern, blocked cardiac sodium channels are probably not the best choice.[13-24 h post-scan]I guess if they\u2019re going to do [the block at the] scanner room, and it has to be in that timeframe, then I wouldn\u2019t put lidocaine up there. Maybe bupivacaine\u2026 then probably go with an agent that has a shorter half-life if they\u2019re going to stay there beyond the half-life of the agent.[Post-scan]Lesperguer: What I've also found helpful is to use ultrasound to see where the injection needle is located [in relation to] the fascial plane. So, I\u2019ll give you an example: down towards the distal portions [of back], especially to the obturator nerve. It is lateral towards the nerve. Put the needle towards the lateral side\u2026 you\u2019ll feel a pop and then when you refloat the needle you\u2019ll hear the flow and then you can inject. Than afterwards you can use your ultrasound again to verify that you\u2019re in the interfascial plane. You\u2019ll still have a pop and then you can verify that you injected laterally to the fascial plane. That\u2019s something I learned to do afterwards [in order] to block the intercostal nerves. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time since without ultrasound guidance, but ultrasound guidance helps as a check, so I guess I adopted that practice. The main thing is not to inject deep into the muscle because if the muscle twitches it\u2019s much more uncomfortable for the patient.Prep: Traditionally echo guidance is preferred if available [over palpation], but pal"}

While yeast infections are a common cause of vaginal symptoms, two in a row could be a sign of something more serious. There could be an underlying condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes or pregnancy, that is contributing to the development of yeast infections. Additionally, multiple yeast infections within a short period of time could be a sign of antibiotic resistance, which is becoming a increasing public health concern. If you have been prescribed antibiotics recently and are experiencing recurrent infections, it's important to talk to your doctor or a healthcare provider for further evaluation.

It follows that substituting the placebo by a TumsR antacid (Cal citrate-O-Calcium carbonate-Magnesium hydroxide) will result in the same thing. Thus, the result would be the same whether or not the patient were on Pepto-B. Yet, we expected changes in reported symptoms with treatment with our bio-feedback device compared to before treatment.

{"text": "Question: what other stds would cause this if not gonorrhea or chlamydia? \n ### Answer: Its syphilis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis are other STDs associated with cervicitis. The risk of trichomoniasis is higher among women than men. Cervicitis is the female gynecological disease that is most often related to sexually transmitted infections. Still, several other pathological factors, such as vaginal douching, sperm deposit, and IUD insertion, should also be taken into account (Alyamlah & Alhindy, 2012). Gonococcal infection in women is particularly linked with cervicitis and PSN. Short-term vaginal discharge and cervical bleeding are the most prevalent symptoms. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent causative agent in cervicitis, and it is often asymptomatic (Ju et al., 2012; Lash, Tileva, Joura, & St Fem, 2010). Trichomonas vaginalis is another important causative commensal vaginal pathogens that mediates through mucosal cell invasion and elicits the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Sperling, 2004)."}

{"text": "Question: What other conservative treatment should keep trying? \n ### Answer: The regenerative process being trialled could be spurred by low inflammation and a viral niche that is persistent, and therefore very low transduction efficiency is the limiting factor, which correlates perfectly with earlier work by Mascott . Peripheral ventricular stroke  and removal of foreign bodies from the ventricle  are occasionally associated with de novo regeneration of GFAP+ ependymal cells. The ventricle is a cavity not a blood vessel, but being vascularised has not appeared to help produce any regeneration of missing cells. As mentioned, no worse could be predicted by exceeding the regenerative capacity due to differentiation to basal cells is a common finding with regeneration. The meninges are another possible reservoir of progenitor cells  but work on duplicated meninges in knockouts is negative ."}

{"text": "Question: Do you know how it lowers uric acid? \n ### Answer: Although the author did not specify the effect of oral allopurinol on plasma uric acid concentration, it is reasonable to think that uric acid does not increase or may even decrease with EA pretreatment. That means EA may not inhibit the xanthine oxidase activity, the major enzyme degradation of uric acid, although allopurinol inhibits the xanthine oxidase activity. Possible reduction of arginine settings and improvement of systemic inflammation by EA pretreatment may contribute to the reduction of \"plasma uric acid level\"."}

{"text": "Question: What is benzonatate? \n ### Answer: Benzonatate is a hydrophobic anesthetic of the amide group, which works by interfering with ion homeostasis of the neuronal membranes and blocking neurotransmitter receptors. 2 There are some missing data regarding the mechanisms by which benzonatate achieves its pain control effect, although central inhibition of nociceptive input is believed to be its main analgesic effect. 3 Over-the-counter, often used as an alternative to codeine to treat cough, smoking, and spastic Muslim pain, 4, 5 benzonatate is absorbed slowly after oral ingestion. 2, 6 It has the advantage of being safer than other hydrophobic local anesthetics in terms of toxic effects, although rare cases of allergic symptoms in humans have been described. 2"}

Time to ulnar nerve block-needle tip can get proximal-glycosylate dermatomes. Talking about neurogenic procedural pain is ridiculous. I understand the rationale behind doing the block-explained so-carefully that the patient should not feel any pain. I have done blocks on patients with documented neuropathic procedures. Unless you are at your approach to the mass or doing anesthetic block with the patient -don\u2019t bother me-which yours is neither. I should not be tasked with getting nothing for rib fracture pain. Go to a pain clinic for that-they have procedures to block those. For painful fractures can proceed with either K cheap or numorphon. Motrin does provide minimal benefit in this clinical setting. Going to ED would have worked too: counter to practice pattern. (Fig. 1 Edinburgh Geisser Diagnostic paradigm. This figure is published with municipality of the journal and permission)."}

Therefore, in fact, netty pot is an appropriate and daily formulation for effective rotation. In fact, netty pot can be used any time during the growing season of vegetables. The manure is usually put in the field every rainy season or every three days during the rainy season. However, our advice is to use it every three days. Even children can do this. We have conducted field research and developed it based on the determination that it can be used effectively in areas where it may be difficult to apply organic fertilizer every season. The purpose of this practice is to emphasize that netty half-moon pots can be used very conveniently even in small farms.To what depth can the netty pot be buried in the Field?The netty half-moon pot is applied to garden, flower, and vegetable fields. Therefore, it is buried in or on the surface in the ground in a way that we can easily see. However, if the planting is done with small seeds, it is buried in the ground leaving only the handle exposed on the surface."}

{"text": "Question: Do I need antibiotics? \n ### Answer: \u2014a test of the rule \u201cantibiotic and other infection control\u201d will be triggered if any of the following reactions is given: fever (> 38.0 \u00b0C, repeat when shooting up to 38.5 \u00b0C), increased leukocytes > 10 * 109/L), increased C-reactive protein C-reactive protein > 100 mg/L, purulent secretion or tissue, or systemic embolism. At this point, the treatment initiation is judged by the physicians as an infection, to start a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, and to wear air leak care within 2\u20136 h, and the positive culture specimens are beneficial to avoid unnecessary use. When it is overcombination, unnecessary discontinuing, reducing air leak care, and related to other frequently used antibiotics, are useful to prevent infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are not only without benefit, but also may contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant mechanisms [25\u201328]."}
{"text": "Question: What sort of stool softener would you recommend? \n ### Answer: It is well accepted and has been widely proposed that increased intake of dietary fiber could reduce constipation. Its main role is to enhance the trapping of water through a gel-forming process that alters the visco-elastic properties of feces, which in turn stimulates colon motility directly and indirectly through stimulating endogenous secretion of water 17, 28. The rationale for oral treatment with soluble fibers for chronic functional constipation is based on several observations 29. Soluble fiber can perform five functions: enhancing fecal bulking, maximizing the amount of water absorbed, creating an intestinal microbe-active substrate, stimulating bowel motility, and enhancing maintenance of continence 17, 28. A study including daily diet and lifestyle advice (crude fibers 15\u201330g/d) compared to lifestyle and stool softeners, laxatives and enemas 18 over a 2 years period found that personal hygiene products, stool softeners, laxatives and enemas ranged from 87% to 88%, far greater than the numbers found in any study to date 6. Among people with functional constipation who take prunes, the incidence of personal hygiene products, stool softeners, laxatives and enemas decreased 19% over four months 30. Prunes taken as a diet supplement (30.5 \u00b1 7.2 g/week) for four months in people with functional constipation caused a significant 52% reduction in the number of personal hygiene products, a 16% reduction in over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, and no change in prescription laxatives and enemas 22. Consumption of 75.0 \u00b1 6.7 g prune juice would produce significant reduction of over-the-counter (3%) personal hygiene products, (57%) stool softeners, and 13.5% over-the-counter (5%) and prescription (5%) laxatives 13.

{"text": "Question: If it was an ulcer, would an antacid have helped alleviate some of the pain? \n ### Answer: Not the Op in this instance. Our reader seems to be slightly confused here. Antacids were not readily available in the early part of the twentieth century. Bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol released in 1898, would have been used later. The far more prevalent ulcers were caused by heavy consumption of spicy foods, and smoking. Both of these conditions were mostly reversed by quitting smoking and modifying one's diet to exclude select foods. They were not treated with medications of any kind. Aspirin seemed to exacerbate the pain and lesions. Hence a treatise on aspirin. Bismuth salts, however, came to be used in the late twentieth century as a treatment for non-reticular ulcers."}

You can consider Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG for its effectiveness and safety in acute infectious diarrhea and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. You can also consider Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 to be useful in acute infectious diarrhea. Probiotic yogurt or fermented milk is good for lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus casesi DN114001 is effective against childhood respiratory infections. Lactobacillus fermentum B94 is good against childhood atopic dermatitis. There is little evidence about the effects of probiotics on geriatric patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If you want to use any kind of probiotic, consult your doctor or pharmacist before you start."}
{"text": "Question: Is Bactrim the best option for a uti? \n ### Answer: The question asks about Diagnostic Antimicrobial Stewardship. But in treating UTIs one should not use diagnostic guidance but should treat. Fluoroquinolones are problematic in treating an infection with Citrobacter. Citrobacter are about as broadly susceptible to aminoglycosides as they are to TMP/SMX 34 When you consider the side effect profile is more favorable and the cheaper the tool that you use at this point in time, suggested fluoroquinolone treatment of a UTI is less than ideal. Of note, see my Search referenced in the prior comment, Quinolone treatment."}

{"text": "Question: Would aleve or Tylenol be best for the pain I feel mostly at night? \n ### Answer: This may seem obvious to some, but physiotherapists hear this from patients every day \u2013 is it possible or advisable to differentiate? It is possible when considering drugs to compare analgesic potencies, side effect profiles, efficacy (in the rheumatoid arthritis patient group) and whether the pain is due to acute or chronic inflammatory/neuropathic pain. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that medications can influence gene expression in human cells, which for pain may include infiltrating inflammatory cells. In our patient population, we sometimes suggest that initially a \u2018medium\u2019 potency medication with an acute inflammatory effect may encourage more arthritic reactions in subsequent years. For this reason we may choose, for example, atorvastatin and co-codamol. Aspirin (an anti-inflammatory agent) is assumed to be a safe drug, yet studies have noted early dosing in childhood may be associated with cognitive defects, depression and vascular morbidity.[10\u201313] Aspirin is not recommended for young adults given its long QT syndrome implications. We sometimes discuss with patients that if they feel one NSAID is ineffective they may not wish to continue using it 20 to 30 years later, but should consider a shorter course of stronger drug, and so minimise their total drug exposure. Patients may complain of stomach disruption and the associated acid reflux while on long-term NSAID. It is important to emphasise that these medications do have serious adverse effects that need to be assessed, but which can, with different applications, be minimised."}

{"text": "Question: Is it ok to take probiotics while pregnant? \n ### Answer: It seems logical that the best thing we can do for our baby is to use prenatal probiotics to strengthen the gut and promote delivery of good bacteria. However, to date little research has been done on probiotics in human pregnancy. We should be cautious, as probiotics hold the potential for an immune over-reaction (exactly what we want to avoid during pregnancy). Chronic inflammation has been suggested as a potential risk factor for certain pregnancy complications, particularly in hypertensive-pregnancy . For example, hypertension and pre-eclampsia can result in the placental production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a  (Figure 2). Because certain probiotics are natural stimulants of cytokine production, we have to be careful in choosing a \u201cgood bacteria\u201d to take. Hypertensive-pregnancy is the second leading cause of Maternal and Neonatal mortality in Global North and Global South . In addition, hypertensive-pregnancy is a known risk factor for PID and is associated with antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Hedrich et al., noted that normal pregnancy immunoeffector activities were not altered after probiotic treatment, and supplementation with probiotics throughout pregnancy was deemed safe for both mothers and fetuses. The author also noted that probiotic inclusion in basic nutritional supplements, such as Iron vitamin complex supplementation, could provide optimal treatment for pre-existing anemia (common in pregnancy) and enhance fetal iron accretion."}

These include but are not limited to the onset of symptoms, duration of illness, the ability of the child to open the eye, eyelid swelling or cherry eye, number of episodes with fever, redness of the white of the eyes, sticky mucus/discharge from eyes, other symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, otitis media, or the complexity of the problem, as this will also guide the decision to refer the child.

{"text": "Question: Does it matter if drooling occurs during sleep? \n ### Answer: Yes, it matters to the level of distress the parent experiences, regardless of the volume of drool. It may also influence occurrence of parentally-perceived and other sleep problems, such as sleep disruption, exposure to hypoxia, and parental sleep loss. These findings add information on the role of sleep disorders in drooling and influence on parental distress. It is theoretically possible that LDD reduces the volume of air passing through the nasal cavity, produce negative intrathoracic pressure swings and thus reduce nasal pressure (Kosak et al., 1980), and potentially induce obstructive sleep apnea (Butler et al., 2003). Clearly there is a need to explore the mechanistic interaction between LDD and sleep disordered breathing and expand our knowledge on the major function of LDD and its presumed protective value. This may enable recommendations on how to manage drooling and further contribute to prevent or treat nighttime drooling."}

{"text": "Question: What can I do to prevent the yeast infection? \n ### Answer: Here are some suggestions to decrease and treat yeast infections:1. Wear breathable cotton underwear and fit them loosely to the body. More air circulation around your genitals may help to keep the penile skin dry and less prone to yeast overgrowth.2. After masturbating or sex, ensure your genitalia are clean and dry. Avoid wearing condoms if possible during masturbation as they can trap moisture so that it remains around your genitals.3. Keeps your genitals dry and try to avoid wet foreskin. Try to dry your foreskin skin after cleaning your penis. Moisturizing with lotion is vital as it maintains the penile skin's health, but try to choose a water-based rather than oil-based moisturizer.4. Wear baggy, loose-fitting, and cotton-made shorts or underwear. You can use a barrier cream if you are planning to wear tight-fitting pants for a prolonged period.5. Wash your genitals regularly using soap and water but try to avoid harsh detergents (ask for mild soap-free/alcohol-free). Rinse well and pat the area dry instead of rubbing it vigorously.6. Use sufficient amount of water and soap for bathing. Avoid using bubble baths as they can cause irritation. Be gentle while drying the genital skin.7. If you have recurrent yeast infections, get an antifungal cream to keep at home to apply yourself or have a partner apply it to you once per week. Moreover, to prevent infection recurrence, avoid wearing tight-fitting pants and non-breathable fabrics.8. You can eat unsweetened yogurt with active cultures of Lactobacillus or Lactobacillus acidophilus live bacteria as they might be beneficial and reduce the number of yeast infections (8).When to contact a doctorGenerally, it is a serious infection if:\uf077Your symptoms do not improve after one week of OTC treatment.\uf077Your symptoms worsen after treatment.\uf077You experience more than one yeast infection per month.Or if you are immunocompromised (e.g., HIV positive) or diabetic and have any symptoms of yeast infection.Materials and methodsDigital media examinationsGP photo notes including"}

Fever needs to reach 103\u00b0F or more for the fever to be considered a \u201cvery high fever\u201d that can be associated with serious illness.(2)Which of the following is considered to be a serious illness?The following are considered to be serious and life-threatening diseases: pneumonia, meningitis, tuberculosis, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis. In addition, certain viral diseases such as measles, Rubella, mumps, varicella, viral hepatitis, and hepatitis A and B are considered serious illnesses.(2)4.What is the route of transmission of this disease?Most of the diseases above are transmitted via droplet particles released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This particularly does not apply only to the viral infectious diseases mentioned above but also to most of the bacterial diseases mentioned above. Importantly, tuberculosis transmission occurs only when a person is exposed to the cough or sneezes while tubercle bacilli were in the patient's mouth cavity or airways. Tuberculosis can also transmit through airborne route.(2)5.Which disease may require the identification of the organism?The accurate diagnosis of some diseases (infectious and non-infectious) requires the identification or isolation of the microorganism, because only finding the microorganism can confirm the disease.(2)6.Which is an invasive disease?An invasive disease presents when a pathogen normally localized to the skin or mucous membranes usually will spread and spread into the bloodstream and tissue sites. Such diseases are connected with high morbidity and mortality rates. These diseases are: \u226aBartonella quintana\u226b\u2013 a bacterium that transmitted via body fluids and is responsible for trench fever or Trench Fever; HIV (Human Immunodeficiency virus)\u2013a virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome); \u226aHepatitis A virus\u226b and \u226aHepatitis B virus\u226b\u2013 transmitted via blood and body fluids and cause chronic infections of the liver.

{"text": "Question: Do you recommend a vitamin for urinary tract health after taking antibiotics? \n ### Answer: Lanreotide is usually not recommended. Calcium and vitamin D is sometimes advised. It is used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin E plays an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, so a high concentration of alpha-tocopherol in the bone marrow can accelerate the processes of osteoporosis. Here, vits is included. Quercetin or CVD is often recommended since it seems to both maintain the collagen and elastin structure that sustains the anatomical integrity of the urogenital and digestive mucosa, and contribute to tissue repair by scavenging of free radicals and reduction of inflammation. And methionine seemed beneficial especially in peripheral neuropathy. However, l-\u03b1-Lipoic acid is not listed for a reason there. Also, it is important to contain vitamin D and K. In that sense, you should mention about the olanzapine-induced bradycardia, who was in vitamin D and K deficiency. And mecobalamin seems to be beneficial in intestinal fibrosis with tetracyclines. But, as I said previously, the number of papers is small for these points, so I understand that you need to report about the most well-known therapies.

{"text": "Question: I would like to ask, how does Flonase help with ear fluid? \n ### Answer: Will it drain fluid out if there is too much already? Since it may mix up with the infection, I suspect it will make the ears worse. I hope you can clarify this for me. Thank you. Flonase (fluticasone propionate) is a topical steroid frequently used to relieve allergy and other nasal symptoms. It works by reducing inflammation and congestion in the nose. I am not aware of any evidence that it affects ear fluid. It\u2019s possible that the ear and nose are somehow related (like perhaps the linings of the structures secrete mucous with a similar composition). I suspect it would be not harmful to try it on your ears, but I am not convinced it would be helpful. These are my opinions, notbased on any evidence, so please consult a doctor before you use it on your ears. Surgical interventions often arise when conservative management has failed, with bilateral disease or with complications. [2, 3]. Tympanostomy tube insertion is often the first surgical option and is used to maintain a perforation and allow pressure equalization between the mastoid cavity and the external environment. The use of ventilation tubes allows for ventilation of the middle ear, resolution of otosclerosis, or atrophy of the mucosa and promotes re-epithelialization.\u00b0 Thus, performing tympanostomy tube placements requires a minimal quantum of experience. This study aims to evaluate the use of the HEARO atlas to facilitate tympanostomy tube insertion for otosclerosis."}

What I was saying is my neurologist gave me a prescription for the sero, and he allows the otc pharmacies to fill it. I can see how that would make me annoyed too the doc did switch me over to that med. I look at SSRI as mines a safety net if I get any actual symptoms real bad, or having a hard time with the meds I already have. I find that you really have to mix and match sometimes with different medications. It seems you can have a lot of GI side effects with one, or a lot of brain/sleep issues. So having each other one can help offset the problems you have with the other. That\u2019s just my opinion of course."}

I am sure that a very convincing answer to this question cannot be given. Perhaps we need the help of some experts involved in sports medicine and orthopedic surgery, but if we turn to these specialists, they may be quite reluctant to answer such a question because of the unknown effects of achieving an optimal figure on the patient's health after the treatment of a fracture.

{"text": "Question: Is there anything I can take or use to relieve the itchiness? \n ### Answer: The current clinical management of pruritus usually relies on the systemic administration of benzodiazepines or histamine H1-antagonists (Gonzalo-De-Lomasera et al., 2013). Although well known for their antipruritic effect, these medications are better recognized for their sedative, muscle relaxant and anxiolytic effects. As a consequence, their use is associated to certain adverse events, mainly their sedative and cognitive effects. Moreover, due to these side effects, patients are frequently under dosed to minimized these adverse effects, compromising the effectiveness of the treatments (Gonzalo-De-Lomasera et al., 2013)."}
{"text": "Question: Is there a better anti inflammatory that works better than ibuprofen? \n ### Answer: - Asked by 7 peopleDuring TNFI symptoms and the chronic stage of SLE/RA, which form of ibuprofen lasts a longer duration, 400mg or 24-hour release form?Drugs used to maintain remission in RA, how regular period does not disrupt effectiveness? - Asked by Patients 1-3Which one is the best DMARD to start with in young SLE patients? Used Celebrex in the past but felt that it was not strong enough- Asked by Patient 4 -GINA TreatmentIn humans, exogenous administration of IFN-\u03b11 is used in the treatment of certain Eastern cancer, or to boost the immune response in the case of hepatitis C . In MS, administration of IFN-\u03b2 is designed to block autoimmune disease progression by limiting T-cell proliferation, simultaneously dampening Th-1 and enhancing Treg 5 response. It specifically modulates peripheral T cells, adding to the pool of circulatory Tregs supported by their antigen-independent survival . INF-\u03b2 hampers T-cell dependent cytokine storms by regulating the demarcation of T-cell activity by modulating inflammatory cytokine synthesis, indirectly empowering smoldering Tregs to transcend Th-1 responses. According to Coppi\u2019s study, IFN-\u03b2 diminishes Th1-to-T-reg redistribution and enhances T-reg-associated function . Further, development of IFN-inducible CXCR3 negative Tregs\u2019 pool was shown in a study by Nishimura . Although various factors are involved in Treg development, CXCR3 appears to be an interesting molecule to analyze Treg migration to sites of chronic inflammation. According to more than one experiment, IFN-\u03b2 regulates the trafficking of Tregs through the up-regulation of CXCR3 Other work has been done to marshal the efficacy of an alternate molecule, which is critical for the establishment of peripheral antigen-specific tolerance . The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, specifically correlation protein (nrfp3) was shown to reduce autoimmune arthritis .

{"text": "Question: Is augmentin the same as amoxicillin? \n ### Answer: Amoxicillin is a penicillin synthetase that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is most effective against Gram-negative bacteria and has excellent coverage of common respiratory and genitourinary tract pathogens. Augmentin is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor that potentiates the enzyme inhibition of amoxicillin. Given the mechanism of action, the question could be raised: Is augmentin the same as amoxicillin? The answer is: no. In addition, clavulanic acid has often been used in combination with other antibiotics for its ability to inhibit enzymes such as beta-lactamases, aminopeptidases, phosphinases, and other lysine proteases found in many resistant bacteria.9 Therefore, antibiotics that have been combined with clavulanic acid do not have the same properties as amoxillin."}

{"text": "Question: Periodontal disease isnt a clear bacterial source? \n ### Answer: It is more of a host response issue than a bacterial infection. The bacteria only play a role in triggering the inflammatory pathway in a susceptible host. The reasoning that it shows up in mixed infections with Aspergillus is mostly due to (a) the procedure of how they collect the clinical samples to test for infection in the setting of HIV and (b) that aspergillus is a common coexisting infection in HIV and both the saliva and blood stream contain fragments of the bacteria upon infection."}

{"text": "Question: Is brochitis infective to others? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes. The disease is caused by a bacterium called Bordetella pertussis. It is highly contagious and spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. The incubation period is 7 to 10 days. The disease is more common in children and can be serious in infants. The symptoms include a cough that lasts for 2 to 8 weeks, whooping, and sometimes vomiting. The cough can be very severe and may interfere with breathing. The disease can also cause irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding in infants. Antibiotics can help shorten the duration of the illness and reduce the risk of complications. Vaccination is the best prevention."}

{"text": "Question: What is the benzonatate? \n ### Answer: Benzonatate is a centrally acting natural respiratory stimulant. The drug binds to \u03bc-opioid receptors located in brain areas that regulate respiration in an agonistic manner. The drug was developed as a substitute for codeine, which has similar respiratory stimulatory but more potent analgesic effects than benzonatate. Combined with citric acid and sodium benzoate, benzonatate is used to relieve cough in cough syrup."}
{"text": "Question: Is it better to try not to cough or to cough? \n ### Answer: Control over coughing would surely be beneficial, since cough is not harmful to the patient except when it persists as a chronic event. An attenuation of the cough reflex would reduce effects on work and others, and there may be interventions that could be helpful to achieve this. But it remains unclear if attenuating the cough reflex would have harmful consequences, particularly in smokers and those with reduced lung function. The benefits of altered cough reflex would thus need to balance a risk of difficulty clearing mucus, thereby setting up a vicious cycle of respiratory illness. It will be important to determine the extent to which cough, induced by smoke exposures, encompasses the responses of cough rather than impulse responding to mechanostimulation. Thus, better understanding of regional lung inflammatory responses following smoking will help provide a basis for developing approaches to interventions and better treatments for cough, such as drugs, biofeedback, and/or deep breathing manoeuvres such as lung-stretch to reduce the reflex sensitivity to cough. After establishing that cough induced by smoke is of intermic lock origin, the reflex can be interfered with by vagal nerve stimulation  or interrupting bronchopulmonary C-fiber afferent traffic. The attraction of stimulating vagal fibers to suppress cough is that there is a dearth of vagal bronchopulmonary afferent input during rapid breathing at rest, so the concern about interrupting breathing disappears . Thus, the afferent vagal bronchopulmonary inputs during rapid breathing at rest can then be targeted ."}

{"text": "Question: Just wanted to question if you think 3 days would be enough to treat a UTI or why I would have been prescribed more days in the past? \n ### Answer: The 3-day limit of treatment seems a bit short, because 3 days is about the time when most bladder bacteria are even able to begin to replicate and I think that the treatment needs to introduce more than the theoretical amount of IJEF when dealing with UTIs, since the biofilm is essential for pathogenicity of the disease.

There was no trend towards benefit with the SSRI either so this is not just a case of SSRI not working fast enough. Another red flag is the lack of a placebo group. This should be there, particularly given the \"drug's\" immediate and rapid onset which I find suspicious of being a non-drug effect (Placebo's lag in onset, usually about 2 weeks, has been shown in multiple clinical trials). With every pill that is taken before a shock aversive, the probability of serving as placebo is reduced and not reaching a main shock every time in this study may then itself have served as a predictor too."}

{"text": "Question: How fast does paxlovid work? \n ### Answer: At the time of this writing, the literature produced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is dominated by studies of courses of therapy, which requires 5 days of treatment, for which 2 to 5 days of follow-up have been provided. In this interim summary of 108,649 patients in 18 publications, paxlovid reduction of viral load hemorrhagic strokes rate occurred with impressive rapidity, particularly within 48 to 72 hours. At the second day of treatment, a decline of \u223c4 logs could be seen (3). Although these were published data on early treatment of COVID-19 before marketing authorization was approved, there is no clear signal that early treatment of acute stroke by IV thrombolysis is qualitatively different from chronic stroke where treatment with paxlovid is currently approved. Acute and chronic stroke should not be treated as separate disease entities, because acute stroke is often a sequela of chronic stroke in patients with cardioembolic embolic risk factors. Finally, no information is provided on how fast the underlying chronic stroke will improve. As paxlovid treatment is not a cure but a prolonged process, it makes sense to treat patients until clinical improvement, neurological symptoms improvement or death. The neurological improvement process should continue in journal publications, in association with direct evidence of underlying viral load reduction. In this case, paxlovid appeared to be effective within 72 hours of death, but it remains unknown whether neurological symptoms improve such as in other conditions (stroke, heart attack). If the other approved indications for paxlovid vary little from the original half-life and dosages, even in cases of stroke, half the original dosages are also expected to be effective, if government regulators approve lower costs to expand low- and middle-income countries, without undue delay, an improved profile."}

After 4\u20136 hours, swelling normally resolves, thus allowing the patient to receive oral nutrition. Some patients improve after 72 hours, while others may take 4\u20136 days to return to normal. These may be heavier and longer for patients with underlying medical conditions."}

{"text": "Question: How does BV occur in a patient? \n ### Answer: BV is a polymicrobial infection, and the most common bacteria involved are Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera type I, and Prevotella bivia. The pathogenesis of BV is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including changes in the vaginal microbiome, host immune response, and hormonal changes. The most common theory is that an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome, with a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in anaerobic bacteria, leads to an overgrowth of these bacteria and the production of amines and other metabolites that are toxic to the host. This can lead to inflammation and irritation of the vaginal mucosa, which can cause symptoms such as itching, burning, and discharge."}

{"text": "Question: Are there any alternatives to the Wellbutrin? \n ### Answer: Most cases of VTE are associated with reversible risk factors, so these should be brought under control whenever possible and changes in therapy initiated where possible. For patients with an unprovoked VTE, some studies suggest that aspirin 325 mg /d may reduce the recurrence rate and long term prophylaxis with anticoagulants may be appropriate for women with hormone-related risk factors including estrogen, oral contraceptives and progesterone-one only pills . However, no proof of long-term or short-term mortality benefit exists for patients treated with aspirin and its use is only recommended for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction. Recurrent risk for VTE remains high in some selected patients, for example patients with idiopathic pulmonary embolism who appear to share common risk factors with the tamoxifen women (eg older women, obese, postmenopausal). There may well be an underlying inherent risk of clotting with tamoxifen that will put these patients at higher risk of future thromboembolism. We continue to support the recommendations of Carroll et al (2008) : Tamoxifen Continuation Plus Aspirin (TAP) (tamoxifen plus aspirin daily) is now our preferred strategy as it will result in lower health care costs as compared with tamoxifen alone. However, if a patient is at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend that tamoxifen be stopped and replaced by some other type of estrogen."}
{"text": "Question: Is there a way to prevent these vertigo attacks? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes. The most important preventive measure is to avoid the triggers. The most common triggers are head movements, especially rotation, and changes in head position. Therefore, it is important to avoid quick head movements and to keep the head in a stable position. This can be done by using a neck brace or a neck collar. Another important preventive measure is to avoid activities that cause vertigo attacks, such as climbing stairs, walking on uneven surfaces, and driving. It is also important to avoid activities that cause fatigue, such as prolonged standing, walking, and lifting heavy objects."}
{"text": "Question: What is causing the throbbing pain and sensitivity to light? \n ### Answer: The answer is a condition called subconjunctival hemorrhage. It is a collection of blood under the conjunctiva, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually caused by a blow to the eye or a hard eye-rubbing, but it can also occur spontaneously. The pain and sensitivity to light usually last for a few days, but the hemorrhage itself can take a couple of weeks to clear up."}

{"text": "Question: Is Claritin or Zyrtec safe with breastfeeding? \n ### Answer: Both Zyrtec and Claritin are considered safe for use during breastfeeding. However, Claritin is more likely to cause side effects in breastfed infants than Zyrtec. Claritin is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, and it is metabolized to desmethylclaritin in the infant\u2019s body. Desmethylclaritin is the active metabolite of Claritin, and it has a longer half-life than Claritin. This means that infants are more likely to experience side effects from Claritin than from Zyrtec."}
{"text": "Question: Ok, would ice or heat help as well? \n ### Answer: Since a big issue seems to be inflammation. In that case I would goes towards heat application (and massage/lymph flow help unrefractory areas), if the lymphedema is more of a chronic condition with fibrosed tissues and partial lymphatic block (I dont know the specifics of the case). If the lymphedema is more acute and caused by a disturbance in lymphatic flow more recently, I would go for the more anti-inflammatory type of treatment. I would then do compressive bandaging only in the case of acute or recent lymphatic obstruction, as I find that excessive pressure and/or compression on a chronic condition will just lead to more fibrosis in the skin. You may have over 60% of lymphatic drainage from tissues being though afferent lymphatics (I think this percentage may be even higher, not sure though, a few recent studies have confirmed the role of this type of lymphatic vessels as drainage pathways in tems of a rapid drainage in upper and lower tissues at least!'ll refer to this another time.), so loss of these pathway/function through excessive pressure and fibrosis, will give a loss of function, as the lymph still has to go somewhere, so it just goes into venous circulation if it cant go through the afferent lymphatics."}

{"text": "Question: Is it possible for it to be pneumonia? \n ### Answer: Lung ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and the differentiation of lobar and interstitial pneumonia. In addition, because it is radiation free, the amount of usage in children has increased . Determination of pneumonia with dilatation of the bronchi on ultrasonography is accepted as positive, but dilatation of the bronchus is a severely generalized finding that occurs in various diseases as well as in asthma, COPD, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and community-acquired pneumonia. Accordingly, the patient cannot be evaluated on the basis of this specific finding alone. In addition, detection of changes indicating pulmonary edema may occur in both acute bronchiolitis and asthma . However, the operating principle of ultrasound wand in these diseases is different, with a target better seen in acute bronchiolitis than in asthma and there being no pathology seen on CT of the chest. Additionally, the frequency of deterioration is seen in acute bronchiolitis. For this reason, although dilatation purulent bronchi are detected on ultrasound in asthma and acute bronchiolitis, differentiation should be given particular importance by the physician."}

{"text": "Question: Is it ok to have antibotics and cough medicine at the same time? \n ### Answer: No, it is not recommended to take antibiotics and cough medicine at the same time. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral infections such as the common cold. Taking antibiotics when you have a viral infection, such as the common cold, will not help you get better and may cause antibiotic resistance."}

Then when she heals completely the yeast also disappears. Maybe associate with herpes in my mind being that this scarring is now adhering to the labia."}
{"text": "Question: Is it normal to have slight intermittent blurring with a bacterial pink eye? \n ### Answer: It's been about 24 hours since BC+ to BC- and 2 weeks since the last dose of Erythromycin and the blurring is present. It can be difficult to see through my eye but only during certain times of the day. If the doctors and pharmacists on here haven't had this experience themselves, I strongly recommend that they seek the advice of an ophthalmologist. Visual clarity when suffering from an eye infection leaves a lot to be desired. It's a frustrating and rather disconcerting experience, and it can hinder quick and precise movement of the eye, thus slowing down simple functions such as picking up an object or drinking from a cup while walking. It's markedly diminishing with the Erythromycin drops but was still moderately present."}
{"text": "Question: What are the long term deficits that may happen? \n ### Answer: The question suggests that apraxia is always permanent. I am not aware of this standard view on apraxia (see below) but there are temporary symptoms in apraxia of object use \u2013 e.g. in the right IPS so called virtual lesion syndrome (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-9109(13)60154-7). In apraxia of gesture(use) the deficits are more often more permanent (Stanfield and Evans, 2009). I agree that, if one treats the amnestic and apraxic deficits separately only the first one could be completely recovered. For some aphasic patients with apraxia of object use the deficit will be permanent, for other it might be partly reviewed with training (I am not saying that this will be the case in most patients, but it is not true that the lesion always results in permanent apraxia). Therefore I object to the following sentence in the last paragraph: we can term apraxia as permanent. This point needs to be addressed properly."}

{"text": "Question: Is there an antibiotic that could help ? \n ### Answer: A few years ago it seemed that antibiotics killed off some of the leptoplasts and inflammation even though they did not clear the infection. There does not seem to be a class of drugs that is uniformly superior. If your illness is helminth driven the two most powerful antibiotics are the floxquinones or the tetracyclines (doxycycline). The floxquinones cover the Coxiella bacterium and a number of the anaerobes that contribute to Lyme and Titan-3  and to a lesser extent the melioidasis of tularetum and a few enterobacteria."}
{"text": "Question: Should I put the drops in both eyes to prevent it from spreading to my other eye? \n ### Answer: Many eyedrops that are used for anterior segment disease, including antibiotics such as chloramphenicol or tobramycin, are used in both eyes during the infectious episode in eyes with unilateral disease. However, this practice may be unnecessary for some antibiotics and may explain why significant numbers of patients develop macular oedema in the fellow eye [74, 75]. There seems some evidence that in general, if one eye has active infection, these of use drops may have some transient effect in the fellow eye. The antibiotics used, the formulation, the route of application, the duration of the infection and the possible concurrent disease may determine whether drops should be used in both eyes [42, 74, 75]. This should be thought about when considering potential treatments for CMV retinal infection, particularly steroids, which are more likely to work in one eye than both eyes, and antivirals (ganciclovir) which are presumably more likely to work in both eyes."}

{"text": "Question: Would high heart rate be caused by being overweight at all? \n ### Answer: A high BMI along such a system, with high HRV to all self-reported weight scales in Table 1, seems to suggest that being overweight causes poor health generally. And especially poor cardiovascular health: indeed, as predicted by Bloch\u2019s findings, we observe a steady negative correlation of BMI on the HRV descriptor of IQR. Weight seems to facilitate worst outcomes, and by this hypothesis, the more a body weights against the normal ideal of a healthy BMI, the worse are its general health consequences. Hence the similarities between using BMI as a 0-point measure of obesity and using zero as a measure of no diabetes does indeed seem well-founded. But this is more than a metaphor: it suggests (via equation 5 and the appendix) that obese bodies may need higher blood pressure to meet bodily needs, but so at the expense of higher mortality rates."}

{"text": "Question: What's the STD test? \n ### Answer: Large sample size can increase the statistical power of the test and then the negative result be replaced by the positive one. Moreover, there are some problems in this study which attributable to the experiment design. First of all, the plasma from the same condition should be hybridized for replicate, and then its non-biological variation can be subtracted through a series of biological tests. Besides, quality control of microarray experiments including chip plotting, data normalization, and publication of the raw data is necessary for the research. In fact, lots of microarray meta-analysis are designed based on multiple studies conducted by heterogeneous platform. Some algorithms especially CEL method were developed for correcting different platforms to ensure the reliability of transcriptomic analysis. Zhu, G  presented an effective CEL method for meta-analysis of gene expression data. Wada, Y. A  devised statistical pipelines using weighted diversity pooling with index and c links in a cahoots workflow which can remove systematic variation and yield effective detection. Last but not the least, we emphasized that the same staining protocols and/or profiling platforms (e.g., the same chip type, or same scanner machine) are suggested to be used when multiple cohorts are generated."}

I\u2019m not sure if yogurt exposes you to potency but the bottom of the tub says it should help blood pressure and increase calcium and buffering capacity of stool plus it has nucleotides. Would that count? Or do you recommend getting the supplement? Again no hostility just don\u2019t understand because my boyfriend gets OREO probiotic cookies and feeding our son those would be eating them daily if they are additive whereas the supplement is only like a couple times/week. It almost seems scammy like you have to keep buying, it needs to be powered to be effective. Yogurt seems more straight to the point and if they\u2019re buffering capacity stools it\u2019ll be more consistent with what you eat, versus what you take once a week.

{"text": "Question: Ok at what point should I be concerned that it goes beyond viral and develops into infection? \n ### Answer: A: That's a really good question. I think that's an evolving question that people don't yet have the answer to. The problem with people with cancer, if they get infected, it can go badly. And so as quickly as we can tell you how to tell patients when to seek care, we should do that. So, I can tell you that in mild cases, where a patient might have a cough or runny nose, that would not be a reason to start antibiotics, especially if it's been within a week of getting sick. That would, again, be a reason to maybe go to the gym but certainly not to see a doctor. But if that persists and also maybe associated with fever or some gastrointestinal symptoms where, then it's appropriate to go to the doctor and get a good workup. The guidelines generally say three days of symptoms or purulent sputum or having a temperature over 38.3 [centigrade]. For a not mild case, with shortness of breath or two weeks of symptoms or a patient that's getting worse, that patient needs to be seen in the ER."}
{"text": "Question: Anything for cough? \n ### Answer: This is one of the commonest leading signs sought by care-givers and users. However, it may not be pathological condition in the strict sense but could be due to incidental exposure to infectious aerosols and / or bad diet or poisoning. The challenge in making correct diagnosis of cough is thinking through the possible causes. Such causes include bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastro-esophageal reflux and / or chronic fever syndromes, among others. On the other hand to curb excessive It has been shown that poor communication between asthma patients and healthcare provider has a significant a role to play in poor asthma control \u2019.

{"text": "Question: and what time of day is best for taking Lexapro? \n ### Answer: These things should be included in the initial information provided about a medication. I spoke with one pharmacist who recommended a reduced starting dose of 3 milligrams per day and one pharmacist who suggested a maintained lower starting dose middle method, but neither gave reasons for this, they merely offered these suggestions. But specifically, for some patients, 5 milligrams might be too much, too fast, and starting at lower than the most common starting dose may cause fewer side effect issues than jumping right into the most common starting dose. Like I said, this is just one example, but this entire post is about a lack of standardized initial information about medications for patients. I think it would be really easy to have a national database of the most commonly recommended initial dose and other suggestions for specific medications. Often, the call to include such information in initial visit plans or in handouts is indirect: there is research that has shown effects on adherence or demonstrating how including this information at the first visit could serve to reassure initial visitors. But what I\u2019m arguing here is that there is value in including such information, namely patient-centered, anecdotal evidence at the visiting patient\u2019s level. Furthermore, many medications and medical treatments come with a long list of stigmatizing or even unintended side effects. I think patients deserve to know about what physicians have learned about side effect reduction and patient anecdotes about such adjustments. Whether or not stigma is reduced in this way is central to patient\u2019s post-therapy experiences, health outcomes, and adherence to treatment."}

{"text": "Question: Do I use Benadryl pill or Benadryl cream? \n ### Answer: Benadryl pill (diphenhydramine) is an oral antihistamine to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Benadryl cream, on the other hand, is a topical antihistamine specifically used to treat the itching and swelling of insect bites and stings. It is not appropriate to use Benadryl cream for skin itching and swelling caused by allergies as it may worsen the condition. If you are unsure which product to use, please consult your healthcare provider or a pharmacist."}

{"text": "Question: What would be the approach if it's a resistant infection? \n ### Answer: Which strategy do you prefer and why?Antimicrobial resistance is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge in the management of infectious diseases. Further studies, dynamically and precisely summarizing the nature of antimicrobial susceptibility, and its associated changing epidemiology, should always be in the spotlight. On the other hand, case reports may be the source that alerts clinicians on unusual and poorly recognized symptoms, and any detailed description about the place of presentation, clinical manifestations, laboratory test procedure, microbiological and histopathological processes, and its management, together with coherent discussion, can guide further studies and clarify previously unrecognized co-associations (Atl\u0131, Cetin, & Ba\u015ftu\u011f, 2020).Antibiotic sensitivity testing is important for the prevention of the emergence of resistant bacteria. Determination of the type of pathogenic and the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics prior to antibiotic therapy is one of the most important measures in the fight against microbial resistance. When considering case reports or case series reports, a follow-up that summarizes what strategies have been developed in resistant infections and which one is successful can be more informative.https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/114755/Research-Highlight-Antimicrobial-resistance-Almanac_tc.pdf?cgid=Research-Highlight-Antimicrobial-resistance-Almanac_tcfor programs that provide parenteral antibiotic therapy without delay in children with life-threatening infectious diseases:Remarks: In case of proven benefits in India that large group of children is provided parenteral antibiotic therapy without a delay, Editorial of Indian Pediatrics and Journal of Pediatric and Neonatal Care in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India alone (C.

{"text": "Question: What about anxiety relief? \n ### Answer: You start by releasing unfelt anxiety. That\u2019s correct. As you start to release your tensions, tightness, and general muscle holding, you find yourself becoming less anxious. Past experiences are easier to be put in perspective. Concerns for health of individual group members arise, and they share these openly as trust establishes in the group and the setting. This has also been reported in previous studies . Even in the small experimental group in this study, where the experimental condition was new to everyone in the group, with no one fully knowing the purpose of the intervention, and with even less prior experience with the methods of relaxation, the participants did in fact sustain their initiative to learn the method, and at the end of the study participants reported a dislike for ending the intervention. Previous studies have reported similar findings , and it seems justified to draw on the rich resources of knowledge and understanding in this area ."}

Nevertheless, raw TCMs like deer velvet, Chinese tuckahoe, and dodder seed are more preferred by urban participants, possibly due to their higher affordability both in price. Especially for the rural elderly, TCM like deer velvet, Chinese tuckahoe, and dodder seed were offered with such an enthusiasm because they may or may not be capable to pay for them and the possibility to obtain them is relatively close."}

{"text": "Question: Any suggestions on how to relieve the chest pain when coughing? \n ### Answer: Dr. Xiao's prescription for the Miracle of Medicine: First, the member of health care team asks the patient about the location and how severe the pain is. If the patient can point out where the pain is at all, it is because it is not very serious, according to the theory of Chinese medicine. If the pain is so painful that he/she can't draw a circle, it is because he/she is likely to have vicious collapse and difficulty in cough.Then, the health care team asks them to cough with a deep breath and cough must be loud and irritating. This way can clear the phlegms and the pain can be relieved.For severe cough pain, the health team suggests to give some of the medicines as follows: feng-san-he-ye, Ma Bu Si syndromes formula mainly contains fragrant grass rhizome (Atractylodes), elm bark (Celtis kidney), and Poria cocos, which is used to clear \u201cphlegm\u201d and strengthen the lung for them to be able to cough up the phlegm.Huo Che Qi Tao for shu-san-he is made of Ma bu Cao with a bitter taste, which is bitter, cold, and toxic, and excels in dispersing phlegm and promoting urination, such as Ge Gen, TangProtocol and Drainage Qi plus Chentzishen granules.According to Dr. Xiao's troubleshooting list, she suggests taking prevention astringent for dryness in the lungs to promote qi and motility of the lung. Patients are asked to use Fangfeng Muxiang Shenbao Tang to disperse the phlegm of lung heat and heart to dissipate irritability. For patients who cough a lot with cold chills, Beware of Cold with External Relution and Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercise, as recommended by Dr. Xiao, is recommended, which improves the pathogenic environment of the yang. Ping Bu Tang is used to stop itching and cough curing cough and asthma by Dr. Xiao. The Qi is coagulated and a granule of Ban Xia Ku Shen Tang is used as the ingredient."}

Talcum powder (I know it\u2019s not a good idea nowadays)? Anborol (Capilost powder)? Perhaps some essential oils? My understanding is that part of the doctor\u2019s recommendation is the hygienic aspect.

This is where I think a different approach that explicitly addresses the hygienic and organic aspect of ovulatory itching would be useful."}

{"text": "Question: What about ice or heat? \n ### Answer: I homogenize the sample using the Tissue Syringes over ice. I like to keep everything cold for sample integrity through this process. That sample is super thick. That\u2019s what makes it harder to homogenize. I then take 1/3 of that and transfer it to the NucleoSpin RNA XS Linear Tube. That SDS in there will help with the cell lysis.
