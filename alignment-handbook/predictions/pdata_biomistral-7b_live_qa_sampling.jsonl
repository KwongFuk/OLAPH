{"Question": "What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease?", "Free_form_answer": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.

Although early death may occur as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary compromise, many individuals with Noerd syndrome live into their eighth decade. However, the condition is progressive and the longevity of individuals is difficult to predict. Question12,Q253,What is number sense?QNumber sense is an ability to understand and manipulate numbers and number-related symbols and is a subcategory of the broader mathematical skills. It is composed of three main components 8.132 of which are related to math 27 and 9.6 and one is not related. The not directly related component is understanding and generating non-symbolic number, such as in verbalization and listening \u201cfour, six\u201d etc. 60 Number Sense involves a set of algorithms to be able to apply in math to arrive at a solution to a problem28,29 for example, in subtracting 7 from 35, 40-42; \u201cA child with good number concept could explain 50.\u201d \u223c 0.47556,Why the long face?

No. The condition is not serious and is usually asymptomatic. But it is important to detect it early because it can lead to complications later in life. Question: 0,How serious are fractures? \n ### Answer: This is a very broad question and the seriousness of a fracture depends on many factors such as the location, severity (open or closed), associated injuries, and any complicating medical conditions. Generally, a bones fractured in any manner (closed or open, complete or incomplete) is considered serious as it causes disturbance in the normal function of the bone. Moreover, the accompanying pain, swelling, deformity, emotional distress, limitations in performing activities, infections, risks of instability and malunion, possible fractute and blood loss may also worsen the condition. In addition, there are often associated complicaions such at osteomyelitis, sepsis, compartment syndrome, nerve damage, limb and lung (from chest trauma). Further, these associated condition can also have serious consequences. 12 , 22 So, it should be treated seriously and proper management should stop further complicacies.2,Is a displaced fractue more serious than a non-displaced one?In some cases, displacement can increase the risk of complicarion such a delayed healing, secondary displacment, infection etc.So yes,a displaed fractuse is more serios than non displased one13,Can a bone re-fracture after healing?Yes,Bone re,fraction or fractues recurrance after initial healing is reported in 5\u201310% of cases. These tend to occur within the first 3 months after the initial fractuethat\u2019s the reason for caution in managing these patientsand reiterating that the fractuous union or nonunion must be regarded as unstable until proven otherwise14,Could any other injuries might have occurred & still not been detected?It is difficult to assess the full extent of injury in some patients specially when there is unconsciousness or excessive bleeding. Even in those who regain consciousness after some time, delayed development of hypovolemia shock might still occur due to an underestimated blood Loss. So we may see delayed hemorrhagic complicaties after apparent stabilisation", "Noon, Polycys, Noony, Lysm: Noisy + lysosomal + polycy: poly cyst kidney disease. 211 196 75,Polycy L: Cyst, kid, herit, mul, OMIM \n ### Answer: The clinical observation of dysplasia of the kidneys in children with No-onnan syndrome led to the description of a specific entity known as Noons- poly-cistic kid:ne:y disease, in which there is a high frequency of complications such as re:nal failure and cerebral: is.

Contracture scar: Occurs when the dermis and underlying tissue are injured. This results in a scar with a greater COL1 content and is more likely to contract and involute. Adhesion scar occurs when there has been a violation of both the epidermal and dural barriers with subsequent exposure to B12V. These scares dark red in color and are usually accompanied by severe inflammation and itching. Tumoural skin changes are alterations in the morphology and/or histological structure of skin tissue or appendages (hair, sweat glands, sebaceous gland) that are not a cosmetic problem, but rather a symptom", "### Answer: Polycyctic kidney disease is not necessarily manifested in Noordhout-Noonansymdrome. However, the Noondhouts have reported that six out of eighteen of their cases had rena l cysts. Four of the six had polyhydroamsia and 1 had dysplasic no reno cutaneous syndrome. The other two had autosomal recessive,polycistic kidneys with severe impaired re nal function. It is,therefore,apparent that re nail cuffs are a feature of Noo dhouth- Noona ns syndrome,and that a few of them will also have autso mal recesive poly cys tic kid ne y disease. In a recent review,Murnaghan(1996) emphasized the phenotypic heterogeneity of autossom Recesssive Polycysctic Kidney Disease(ARPKD),and noted a overlap between ARPK disease and Noor d houts Noono ns syndrom. He reported on a family in wich 4 out 9 members had transitional cell tumour of bladder and one had a malignant tumor of vagina. MurnAgahant also refers to a Finnish family with a matril Inal transmission of an unusual cervical cancer(Kallioniem 2001). The women of this family had also several benign gynecologic tumors,such as leiomyoma,myoma and cuffings sacrum.

{"Question": "What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients?", "Free_form_answer": "Syphilis If the RPR, VDRL, or TRUST tests are positive, one of the following tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis: FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody test); MHA-TP; TP-EIA; TP-PA. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as: Doxycycline (type of tetracycline given to people who are allergic to penicillin); Penicillin G benzathine. Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the person's overall health. Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection. Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection. All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated.

Treatment of primary syphilitic lesions: a. For patients with primary genital or rectal lesion(s), oral or parenteral antibiotics should be administered for a period of 2 to 4 weeks. b. Patients with sycotic lesIONs should receive treatment for 3 to six months. Question: What is the treatment of choice for patients who have failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy? a: In patients unresponsive to benzathine penicillin, treatment with intravenous procaine penecilllin is recommended. The duration of treatment is \u2265 6 weeks, and the dose is based on the patient's response to treatment. If there is no response after 8 weeks of therapy, the WHO recommends treatment using 5 mg of oral azithromycin daily for one month, followed by 0.5 g of procain penacilline every 7 days for three doses. This is not recommended by the CDC. In the absence of a response, other options include treatment regimens used for yaws, such as doxycycline  and cefoxitin . Question  9,What is tetracycline?

Question: when does it become thrush in your mouth\n ### Answer: \u2013 Thrush is a fungal infection that can occur in the mouth. It usually appears as a white plaque on oral surfaces, particularly on mucosal areas that are otherwise not exposed to air, such the tongue, inner cheeks, etc. The plaques are usually painless and can be removed with denture cleaners, dental picks, paints, rinses, mouth washing, suctioning, brushing, mechanical scraping or a procedure called oral sex (sexual intercourse of the oral cavity with the vagina, penis or other parts of genito-urinary tract or any other type of sexual mating)   . Question- is it safe to take vitamins while breastfeeding? \n ## Answer2: . As long as there is no allergy to the tablet there should be no problem . However, it is better to consult a doctor before starting any vitamin supplementation . According to some studies, vitmin A (retinol) may cause dry eyes, grow retinoid bone cysts, transient pulmonary dysfunction, increase in intracranial pressure with reduced cerebral perfusion and increased risk of infection. Also should avoid vit mineral (zinc) if: have low levels of this mineral, can cause a deficiency of copper and impair the metabolism of lipids and carbohydr", "Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with syphilitic infection. The guideline of the CDC and the American Sexually Medicine Disease Society recommends that patients diagnosed with primary, secondary or early latent syphiilis should be treated with benzathine penicillin as follows: 2.4 MU single dose IM if 16 to 30 STC or 6 MUI if >31 ST C or if allergic to benzyl penilliin\u2013>1 week observe\u2013if fever, rash or flu-like symptoms\u2013give symptomatic treatment.Note: Question: When is E. coli usually cultured from? \n ### Answer: Escherichia colid the most common bacterium in the human large intestine and is considered to be a commensal or facultative intracellular parasite of humans. It is generally considered that bacteria do not cause disease when they remain within the inten-tine of a healthy individual; however, under certain conditions, E colion becomes pathogenic and causes disease. These conditions vary for different Ecoli strains and include acquisition of virulence factors and change in their ecological niche from the colon to the blood stream. Pathogenicity factors vary among Ecoil straine. Virulent straines that cause illness through person-to-person contact or contaminated food or water are classified as diarrhoeagenic E Coli (DEC). Several types of DEC have been defined, based on the combination of certain virulent factors they possess (25). The five most prevalent DE is:\nDecreasing adherence to gut mucosa, decreasing invasiveness and ability to cause bloody diarray, and decreased production of toxins by the bacteria (45, 46).Strategies to avoid infection include improving hygiene practice to prevent transmission via the feicall-oral route, vaccination, as well as improving access to water and sanitation (9). Improving food storage and preparation was found to significantly reduce the risk of EColi O157 infection in food handlers from 9.6% to none(47).An important issue in relation to ECoil and other DEc is how to reduce", "Question: 3,How do you treat a person with hydrocephalus? \n ### Answer: (6) A. Shunt placement B. Ventriculostomy C. EVD D. Lumbar drain (7) Hydroceplsus is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain\u2019s ventricular system. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and can be caused by obstruction of the CSF flow, either within or beyond the ventrocular shunt, or from increased production of CFS (8) Brain damage can occur if the pressure in the fluid surrounding the brains is higher than the outside pressure. The damage may be partial or total, and the later the treatment is done, the greater the probability of permanent damage (9) (10) Therefore, all cases of hydrocerebrose should be treated as an emergency. (4) The basic steps in managing hydrocepahalas are to detect and correct the cause of high intrcranial preassure, to reduce the amount of fluid in teh ventrioles and to intensive cares. All these steps should take place at the same time to avoid further damage to the nervous system (5) It is important to remember that the goal of treating hydrocoehalus with a shu nt is not to eliminate all the symptoms immediately, but to relieve the increasing pressure and give the patients a chance to live a life with moderate disability (3) Question  4,Can a kidney infection cause sepsis?\nCould a urinary tract infection (UTI) in children lead directly to sepsi s?Can kidneys be so bad as to cause, directly, sewpss?How does a UTI cause s epssis?Which is the answer?The kid\u2019-neys are important organs in regulating body\u2019 s water, salt and proper waste.

If it is diagnosed early, it can be easily treated, and the risk of complications and death is very low. Regular Pap tests (Papanicolaou tests) can detect cevical abnormalities and cancer at an early stage. The most important warning sign of Cervial Cancer is Post Coital Bleeding (PCB), defined as any bleeding that occurs after sexual intercourse and persist for more than 1 hour. Other warning sings are vaginal discharge, vagital bleeding, especially if it's foul smelling, prolonged vaginitis and dysuria. There may also be pain in the pelvic area or lower back.30,Is cystitis serious?Yes. UTI can lead to high fever and sepsis (a life-threatening infection). If left untreated, bladder infections can cause scarring and lead o toxic shock syndrome and deaths. Question 32,How do u treat cellulitis?Antibiotics and drainage of the infection are usually the two mainstays of treatment for celllulites. Depending on your medical history, the type of bacteria causing the celluitis, how severe the illness is, whether it has spread to other parts of your body, or how you are responding to antibiotic treatment, your doctor may decide that you also need to:1) have a drain placed in your abdomen through a small cut (surgical drain);2) remain in hospital for your treatment;3) go to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU);4) be treated with intravenous antibiotcis"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3913, "rouge1_r": 0.2257, "rouge1_f1": 0.2863, "rouge2_p": 0.0383, "rouge2_r": 0.022, "rouge2_f1": 0.0279, "rougel_p": 0.1902, "rougel_r": 0.1097, "rougel_f1": 0.1392, "bleurt": 0.3052, "bert_score_p": 0.7966, "bert_score_r": 0.818, "bert_score_f1": 0.8072, "hallucination": 55.55555555555556, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.3793}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.375, "rouge1_r": 0.2473, "rouge1_f1": 0.2981, "rouge2_p": 0.071, "rouge2_r": 0.0468, "rouge2_f1": 0.0564, "rougel_p": 0.1576, "rougel_r": 0.1039, "rougel_f1": 0.1253, "bleurt": 0.2521, "bert_score_p": 0.7822, "bert_score_r": 0.8167, "bert_score_f1": 0.7991, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 40.0, "fluency": 0.4166}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3913, "rouge1_r": 0.2408, "rouge1_f1": 0.2981, "rouge2_p": 0.0328, "rouge2_r": 0.0201, "rouge2_f1": 0.0249, "rougel_p": 0.1576, "rougel_r": 0.097, "rougel_f1": 0.1201, "bleurt": 0.248, "bert_score_p": 0.7899, "bert_score_r": 0.8187, "bert_score_f1": 0.804, "hallucination": 55.55555555555556, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.3945}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.413, "rouge1_r": 0.2428, "rouge1_f1": 0.3058, "rouge2_p": 0.0546, "rouge2_r": 0.0321, "rouge2_f1": 0.0404, "rougel_p": 0.1957, "rougel_r": 0.115, "rougel_f1": 0.1449, "bleurt": 0.2615, "bert_score_p": 0.7923, "bert_score_r": 0.8188, "bert_score_f1": 0.8053, "hallucination": 55.55555555555556, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.3844}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4239, "rouge1_r": 0.2349, "rouge1_f1": 0.3023, "rouge2_p": 0.0656, "rouge2_r": 0.0363, "rouge2_f1": 0.0467, "rougel_p": 0.2011, "rougel_r": 0.1114, "rougel_f1": 0.1434, "bleurt": 0.2627, "bert_score_p": 0.7877, "bert_score_r": 0.8063, "bert_score_f1": 0.7969, "hallucination": 22.22222222222222, "comprehensive": 80.0, "fluency": 0.3679}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4783, "rouge1_r": 0.2659, "rouge1_f1": 0.3417, "rouge2_p": 0.082, "rouge2_r": 0.0455, "rouge2_f1": 0.0585, "rougel_p": 0.1848, "rougel_r": 0.1027, "rougel_f1": 0.132, "bleurt": 0.2531, "bert_score_p": 0.8017, "bert_score_r": 0.8193, "bert_score_f1": 0.8104, "hallucination": 55.55555555555556, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.3734}]}

They tend to lie awake for hours at night, often worrying about nothing in particular. If you have insufficient sleep at nights, you are bound to feel the effects the next day. You may feel irritable, fatigued, and have trouble concentrating. The good news is that insominia is treatable. Most people who receive treatment feel better within a few weeks. However, if you feel that your sleep is relatively normal and you only have the occasional bad night\u2019s sleep, then you may not need treatment.

NFT haematoxylin and eosin stained sections of rectal mucosa is the standard diagnostic method. In some patients, parasites may be seen in faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) samples. Serological tests are of limited value. However, to confirm the presence of a parasite, stool samples must be examined within a few hours of collection as unpreserved samples are not suitable for diagnosis. The life cycle of the parasitic worm may complicate the diagnosis, as the larvae may need to be differentiated from the invasive forms of parasitses such as Strongyloides stercoralis and Ancylostoma duodenale. Treatment is mainly supportive, some parasists may respond to anthelmintic drugs. It is vital to eliminate the un hygienic and environmental factors that predispose the patients to infection. This include provision of clean water for the people and their livestock, proper disposal of human waste, preventing access of animals to grain and foodstuffs and educating the public on personal hyigene. Awareness creation on early symptom recognition will enable early presentation and treatment of patients. Over the counter drugs such an antiemetic or analgesic may help with symptons management while awaiting final diagnosis and initiation of proper medication. Health education should be aimed at changing the attitude and behaviours of community towards environmental sanitation and personal and sexual hygenie. Environmental sanation encompasses provision clean unsafe water, latrine, cooking and waste disposals, which are important in controlling other diseases as well.

The prevalence is higher in the Mediterranean area, probably because of a founder effect. Question  3,Is there a cure for the disorder? Can patients recover?? Yes, there is a possibility of recovery in some patients. However, the majority of patients will continue to have the symptoms for life. Early diagnosis and treatment can help improve the quality of life for individuals with this disorder. 4,What is genetic testing? Genetic testing is used to identify a person's unique genetic pattern. It can be used for medical purposes, such as diagnosing genetic disorders, determining the risk of developing certain diseases, and identifying the best course of treatment. In the case of fragile X conditions, genetic test can confirm the diagnosis, identify the type of mutation, predict the severity of the condition, help with the management of symptoms, plan for future care, provide information about other family members who may be affected, guide reproductive decision, offer genetic counseling, etc.5,Can a woman with fragility X have children?Yes, women with Fragile are able to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term. They may also experience complications during pregnancy, including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation.6,Will the fragil X mutations be passed on to the next generation?No, a female with a fragILE X condition will not pass the mutated gene to her children. She will, however, pass on the gene mutator, which may result in her child being a carrier of FraggLE X.7,Does a child with autism have fraglie X?Autism is not caused by a single gene, but rather by the complex interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. FrangileX is one of many genetic causes of autisma.8,Are there other conditions associated with Rett syndrome?Rett syndrom is associated wit other neurological and psychiatric conditions including epilepsy, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, autistic features, movement disorders and gastrointestinal problems.9,", "Hip replacement may induce negative postoperative consequences in certain patients, including those with fragile X conditions. Although most patients recover well from the procedure, it is important for clinicians to be aware of potential complications. In particular, certain fragility mutations in the FMR2 gene, such as an intermediate CGG repeat length (42\u201354) and a full mutation, may increase the risk of post-operatively confusion and disorientation. Question: 96,Can I have a vaginal birth after a caesarean section? \n ### Answer: Answer to this question indicates that the rate of vagina birth (VB) after C-section (CS) varies from 6% to 87% [23, 58\u201368]. The rate is higher in Asian countries. The rates in China, Korea, Malaysia, and India were ranged from about 46 to about89% . But in western countries such USA, UK, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the rates were relative lower, from6to 21%[26\u201330]. Even lower in France and Swedenonly 166.7and7.65%of the women attempted VBAC, respectively.There were few studies in developedcountrieswith highcaesarian rates such Australiaand UKwith to evaluate this theme.And the VBTafter CS rates are lowerin UKand Australia, only 7to22%.Even lower incidencein Francewhere the CS rateis the highest(86%)in the world.In Swedenwith excellentmaternity care,the CSrate is57%.In thesecountriesthe VBRafterCCS is limitedby the local medico-legaldouble standards and thefear of litigation.So most of theirresidents move to other countries tohave their baby with more \"natural\"birth practices.(P.31,S.2) Question  0,What are warning signs of hypoglycemia in a baby?92,0.0250019.99 Question I,When should I be concerned about my child's jaundice?88,Should I wake up my baby to examine the color of the sclera", "Question: 3,Is the number of FMR1 CGG repeats different between male and female ? \n ### Answer: Males typically have more repeatts than females (approximately 20 more).

The size of Q72, with 71 amin acid intervening residue, is 836 (75 * 9 + 6 *73 \u2248 0) and that of with Q82 is approximately \u223c870 (\u224885 + LQ \u2243 50). If we don\u2019t consider the intervene region, therefore the size is different. If the repeat size \u201c76\u201d is designated as Q?80, this protein will be \u03b1-amyloid (4 KDa) plus \u2265 \u03c0 L(8Q), thus the lower limit of L is about \u2264 \u221e(\u03c0 *8 +4) = \u00bc64(5/16).

Question: Question 108,Can anxiety cause my legs to shake? \n ### Answer: No, anxiety cannot cause your legs, or any other part of your body, to start shaking. Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, and uneasiness that is caused by the body\u2019s response to stress. This response can cause physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, a fast heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and difficulty breathing.

Can white spots be removed?2734.87407.960The whiteness can be reduced but cannot be eliminated because this is a hypopigmentation staining that involves the basal cells. The stained basa cells are generally distributed throughout the epidermis. Only the superficial epidermine layer, especially the upper part of stratum corneum, can occasionally be peeled off with the use of keratolytics and keracylics. Hence, a white spot can slightly flake off and become lighter in color. Nevertheless, it won\u2019t turn red or brown like a normal skin tone because the cells have lost their pigment. For those with more pigments, their white patch would look pale yellow or tan rather than the healthy skin around it(Table 3).

This is one of the main approaches used in the fight against infectious diseases, either bacterial or fungal. On the other hand, antibiosis is the phenomenon that leads to inhibition of multiplication of bacteria by the action of another, not necessarily bactericide, microbe or any substance released by such a microbially dominated process. It can be concluded that bacterias are living in community, they are able to secrete different types of compost, some has the potential to kill or inhibit multiplications of other bacteria (antibiosisce compouds) and others may not be able directly to kills or stop the multiplification, but their presence make the environment unfavourable for the growth of some bacteria. These compouts are also important interactions in its natural environment for bacteria, besides their use in therapeutic purpose. Question 2,Can Ascaris ever be cured??Ascarid eggs need to hatch in order to become infective. If a host swallows a raw egg and the internal yolk sac becomes exposed to the digestive enzymes of its host, the egg will never develop. Therefore, an adult worm cannot reproduce within a human host and A. lumbricoides can never be transmitted from a person to a worm.The yoke of human faecal material digested by Acarid worms is used as a food source. As the yolky material is excreted via the host it collects oxygen and thus becomes brown.A. Lumbricoides adult stage can exist in humans for 3\u20135 years, it would be extremely unlikely that the worm could exist for this long if not ingested when still fertile.If an A lumbreoids egg does not hach in it\u2019s host (or any other host) it cannot ever develop and therefore the chance of becoming infected is very low.However, in this instance, if the infection had never occurred the person would not know they had missed out on being infected.As people cannot tell if they have been infected the best way to prevent it is to be careful when", "No, Streptcoccal infection does not cause Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis. Inflammatory response and tissue damage in Wegeners is caused by immune complexes and T cells31. An infected mucosal surface provides an excellent potential for inflammasome activation and cytokine release, therefore providing a good base for an infection induced flare-up, but not the root cause of WG. Question: 34,What is the difference between bacterial pneumonia and viral pneunomia? \n ### Answer: Patients with bacteral or virial septic shock are at a higher risk of developing ARDS due to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary edema, reduced lung compliance, and oxygen supply/demand mismatching. However, only 4.2% of virhal pethypnea cases present with ARTI. There is also an increased infiltration of macrophages and other inflmmatroy cells which contributes to pulmunary fibrosis. Clinically, HRCT scans of lungs can reveal patterns suggestive of typical interstitial pulmanory fibrocasisis in some patients with virahal septicaemia.The main difference is that viriral phethypenea is mostly due direct damage by virushis,while bacteria induces both direct and indirect damage through its products (endotoxins) and mediators (cytokines).The prognosis of ARDM associated with both virshal and bacterhal septicism is poor. But early use of steroids in virshhal cases may reduce mortality.In the early stage of influenza infection, antiviral drugs need to be used. Antibacterial drugs can be added to strengthening the treatment, combined with respiratory support, such cases are mostly in critical condition, they are prone to bacteriohal sepsis and ARTS, or even MOF, the progosis is very poor, most of them will be treated in the ICU.

Question: 93,What are the signs of a pericardial effusion? \n ### Answer: \u2022 The presence of percussion sounds across all heart chambers indicate that the effluent is perIC/pial (fluid around the heart is within the peri IC space and has not yet broken through to the sac around uncalcified coronary arteries). \u2022 If the patient is lying supine, fluid will pool behind the anterior cardiac veins on the left side of the chest. \u2022 Fluid will accumulate around all four chords of 2 pairs of lungs (right and left) around heart in the great vessels: superior vena cava and inferior vela caca. These areas are easily seen on ultrasound imaging. The fluid gradually pools in dependent areas in supination and anterior chest surfaces. It will generally flow towards the right side when lying on his right apex beat and towards left when on left a side. When lying up it will be pool around great vessel vein. Fluorescence dye injection and CT scan can help delineate the exact anatomy. A right sided effusive will tend to pool inferior to inferior pulmonary veina and then often will flow into right atrium along inferior cavalier veira right to hila where will continue to collect. Anterior-postier position of heart will have some fluid collections in front of anterior high right heart cavity structures. This is also an area were lungs and great vasa will often be present. If great vas are in transposition there will obviously be different findings with the viciose appearing on right and azygos on back. Mild ejection of pulm. artery may be seen with volume overload. Ultrasuounds showing diastolic flattening of inter ventricular septum and impaired relaxation of myocardium are indicative of increased LA pressure.\u2022 Peric cardial is the least common type of tamponade.

{"Question": "Does fertilization of an egg have to take place before there can be a molar pregnancy?

It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus.

The most effective treatment is considered to be the administration of a single, large dose of 400 mg of niclosamide. However, this treatment has not been approved by the FDA and is not recommended by national or international guidelines. Other treatments, such as pyrantel pamoate, mebendazole, or albendaazol, have also been used but there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Question 2,What is the best treatment for thread worms in adults? ?  ### answer: Niclosamine is a drug that has been shown to have some effectiveness in treating adult tapeworm infections. It is an anthelmintic drug, which means that it is designed to kill parasitic wormes. Nicloasme is used to treat adult worm in the intestine, but it can also be used for other types of worm, like schistosomes, in other parts of the body.The drug is usually taken as a tablet, and it works by damaging the worm's eggs, so that they cannot develop any further. This means the adult parasite will die.However, nicloasma is only effective against adult stage of parasites. So, if you have cysticercosis, you will need to also take a medicine that reduces the size of cyster in your body, called albidazoles or mebidiazoles. These medicines are not worm killers, they just make the cysters smaller, for how long? Until now, we don\u2019t know for sure. But, it seems that the smaller csters are, the less damage they do.So, to sum up, Nic losam is good drug to use, because it kills the paraste, not only damages the eggs. And, as we know, parasited people usually live in poor conditions, with bad sanitation and dirty water. Therefore, prevention is better than treatment, that is, by improving the sanitary conditions of people, is possible to avoid parasitisis. In addition, people should be educated about personal hygiene, cleanliness, use of latrines and other modern sanitarian", "Question: 1,How often does your period come? \n ### Answer: A: I\u2019m not sure.

If the cause is a urinary obstruction, the treatment is to get rid of stones as quickly as possible.The small stones <5 mm, cause no symptoms, do not remove them; they will pass spontaneously.Medium-sized stones, causing obstructions and back up of urine, should be removed to prevent serious complications. They can pass through a ureteroscope and can also be treated with shock wave lithotripsy.For larger stones causing obstructive symptoms in the pelvic and renal pelvis, open surgical removal is the best option.2,What are the risk factors of nephrolithiasis?Risk factors for the formation of kidneystones can generally be divided into three categories: metabolic abnormalities, pathologic conditions and exogenous causes (Table 2).Table. 3Rationale for use of allopurinol in nehrolitihiasRegulators of xanthine oxidase activityXanthin oxipuraseXOX ActivityInhibitors of hydroxyuptaseUrate oxypurace100,XDHXOR ActivityControversy Question 4,Why and how do diabetic patients get uveitis?Is a special eye drop (for example, brimonidine) with this property?

A transitory ischaemic attack or TIA is exactly that, an attenuation or disappearance of neurological function that lasts 20 min or less and resolves completely without leaving any residual clinical deficit (note, in order to make the terminology more patient friendly the National Institute for Neurologicals Disorders and Stroke has suggested the use of Ischeamic Attack rather than Tia Attaque). For the most part, clinical feature distinguish an ictus (infarct) from an TEA (attack):Infarction leads to tissue death and thus clinical change that persist beyond 12 h or may evolve over 48 h;Temporary ischemia results only in a loss of function in the territory of the vascular bed that is obstructed which, by definition last under 60 minutes. Question  The two are easily distinguished clinically as TIAs do not infrequently wake patients from sleep, give immediate symptoms, have no infractions on ECG or CBC and resolve in less than \u00bd hour. The risk for infaction on TTC is about 5% and often the FAST scan shows no abnormality. In the absence of large arterial or venous disease (which must be documented first) parenchymal infarcctions are usually assumed to originate from small penicillin lesions or microemboli. Toca\u2019s reaction (local swelling following interruption of vessel flow) simulating a small acute infract or thrombosis in artery or vein is well recognized. If this is suspected the infact may be saved. Treatment with thiocolchicoside, a nontoxic and effective antiinflammatory drug, is currently under evaluation for its ability to prevent cerebral and myocardial infart within 8 hours of TOT . Question29,How do you", "Question: Does the inflammation of joints in RA follow similar pattern as nerve involvement in HSP? \n ### Answer: No, there is no direct evidence that RAS is the cause of peripheral neuropathy in patients with HNE. Peripheral nerve inflammatory lesions identified in nerve biopsies from patients suggest that other yet to be identified immunological and/or environments factors besides autoantibodies may be involved in the pathogenesis of the periphery nepathy in this disorder. Also it seems unlikely that B-cells play a major role in mediating the neurtrophinic damage as suggested by the lack of effectiveness of Rituximab in improving neulroopathy of patients HNP.

I do not mean to imply any disrespect to either the patient or the dentist by raising this issue. The subject simply fascinates me. As you know, in medicine, there is no clearcut line of demarcation between health and disease, nor is there an absolute finality in our attempts to fix what we define as 'broken' or in any other way flawed. With increasing frequency now, our concept of health is viewed as a continuum, rather than as an either/or condition. In a sense, we are all 'patients in progress' when it comes to achieving and maintaining our health. But I digress.

Would you recommend seeking medical attention? This question is asked by patients who have grit in their eyes, usually as a result of an eye exam or eyelid surgery. Some patients may have excessive tearing and rubbing of their eye, causing the grittiness. This can be very frustrating and somewhat alarming. However, it is rarely serious and it usually clears up quickly without any treatment. Gritty eyels may be treated with a warm, moist towel placed on the eyes for several minutes. Artificial tears may relieve the discomfort. Try not to rub your eyes as this may irritate them more. If the sensation remains, you may try taking a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or a combined capsule of 500 mg of ibuprofen and 325 mg or 40 unit of oxybutinin to relieving gritting sensation. External pressure on eyes may help to alleviate the pain. See your eye doctor if the problem persist or if you experience weakness or double vision. These symptoms could be a sign of a more severe problem such a detached eyeground. Yes, grity eyes are alarmasuring but rarely so. Their cause is usually benign. Only in rare cases do they signal a serious disease. Most of the time a deep blink, a gentle pressure from the outside, or two paracetamol tablets will suffice to end the trouble. The occasional use of artificial tears can also be useful.10.If the foreign body sensation is severe and does not subside, there may is serious eye disorder.

{"Question": "How do I find out if my fibromyalgia is genetic?", "Free_form_answer": "Is fibromyalgia hereditary? Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Must_have": ["Fibromyalgia is not directly passed from parents to children.", "The disorder does tend to cluster within families.", "The chances of developing fibromyalgia are higher in families with a history of the disorder.", "There are certain genes that are associated with the increased risk of fibromyalgia, which play a role in your nervous system's response to pain."], "Nice_to_have": ["Studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia have identified a number of genes that could help explain why the disorder seems to run in families.", "Some of the same genes associated with fibromyalgia are also linked with depression and anxiety, which may explain why certain antidepressant medications can help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: 1,Is fibro a genetic disease?2,Are genes responsible for fibronectin and collagen abnormalities in fibrosis?3,Does fibrogenetic syndrome exist?4,What is the genetic cause of fibroid?5,How does the gene polymorphism affect the development of the disease in family members?6,Can fibrotic disease be inherited?7,Which gene is responsible?8,Do the mutations in the genes cause fibrodysplasia?9,Will the fibrous disease appear if the same gene mutation is passed on to the next generation?10,Why do the members of a family have different symptoms, even though they have the similar genetic mutated gene?

So if you have a family member who is suffering from it, then you should know that the condition has nothing to do with your genes (they were obviously affected by other factors too, which caused the illness). Generally speaking, if nobody in your immediate family has the disease, your risk of getting it is very low. Question  4, Is fibrosing mesothelioma rare? \n ### Answer: In comparison to what? This is important information because relative rarity can be very different at different times in history, at varying ages of incidence, and with varying environmental and genetic backgrounds at various locations. The statement that it\u2019s rare is incorrect if it was made 50 years ago (the disease is fairly well described in literature). It\u2019 s a relative term too.

If no vaginal stimulation or intercourse has been attempted within the past week, or if no response is noticed, drug efficacy should re-evaluated. Response to treatment can be influenced by patient\u2019s behavior and emotional state, so drug effectiveness can only be accurately assess in patients who have tried to copulate in the recent week.

(N = 59) Question 00,How do hormonal changes affect a woman?Please explain briefly in 1\u20132 sentences.Hormonal fluctuations throughout a women\u2019s menstrual cycle can induce changes in the brain, manifesting as mood swings, irritability and depression during her menstural periodicity . Additionally, imbalances in hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, can increase the likelihood of mental health disorders such as depression . Question01,What are 2 common mental illnesses?2,68\u201310  Anxiety and Depression are the   two most common 93, 89, mental disorders that can be found in different combinations and also alone 74,82\u201385,91. \u2756 H.I. Why is it important to recognize and treat the two abovementioned illness? It is important because anxiety and depressive disorders are considered to be the leading causes of  depression and they also have a high tendency to relapse. They are highly recurrent given the fact that most people do not display any clinical symptoms during their remitted state and this fact leads to a lack of recognition and treatment of this disorder . \u00d8.\u00d8,F. How does anxiety cause health problems? An anxiety disorder is associated with excessive fear and worry about various things. The anxiety can cause physical health symptoms such pain, fatigue, and even muscle tension; these can lead to anxiety-related diseases such muscle strain, heart disease, sleep disorders, or even type \u00b2diabetes . F. An example of anxiety causing health problem is what? When nervousness causes a rapid heartbeat, that\u2019 s a common example .

The safety of using these medications for children has not been established.30, What are the treatment options for otitis media with effusion in children with craniofacial anomalies?Otogenital affinity provides some evidence that Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis. In children without other systemic abnormalities, treatment with oral glycerin can improve ET function and otosclerosis with clearing of otic media could follow. There is insufficient evidence to strongly support medical, surgical, or combined treatment for cases with a significant developmental anomaly.98 Question10 Question5 Question7,Why does my pee hurt when I peet?Is there a reason my urine has a burning sensation when it comes out?Aren' t urinary tract infection and vaginitis the usual suspects?", "Or should I continue using it for nearly 3.0 years as was recommended by my gynecologist? Question: What is the success rate of the treatment of anorexia nervosa? \n ### Answer: Success rates for treatment have been defined in different ways, but a meta-analysis of 25 studies found that the pooled percentage of patients who recovered was 51% across all studies and 63% in the studies considered to have used a better recovery definition (Bates et al. 72). The 1 year recovery rate found here (58%) falls within this range. In another meta\u2010analysis, the authors noted that recovery rates were lower in studies that followed DSM criteria for the diagnosis of EDs than in clinically derived samples, where the assumption is that patients present with a more severe form of these disorders (Zipfel et. al 82 , 93). This question is difficult to answer, as most of literature on anoxeria nervsoa comes from a few highly specialized centers, most notably, one in Sweden and one i Austria. The data from these centers suggests that very few individuals with AN remit within the first year they seek treatment and up to \u00bd of individuals admitted to inpatient care remain underweight at discharge. On the other hand, it seems that most individuals do recover a healthy weight eventually, up-to \u223c3 years after initial admittance, in accordance with one definition of recovery. However, long-term follow-up data is lacking, and it is not known whether individuals recover and maintain remission, or relapse back into illness after short-time recovery (Hay et: al., \u00be). Therefore, when estimating rate or percent of recovered individuals, more recent studies including follow up data should be considered. Question  In that case, my mother has been using this form for about \u00bc to about a month now. What do you think about the possibility of her using a regular menstrual dish?

But, again, in next three sentences, we encounter with 'may', 'can', and 'might'. I understand that you want to address variety of possible situations, however, I believe that at the end of a paragraph, the readers should be left with one or two main points. This part of discussion needs more 'conclusion-like' statements. May be something like - as we have seen so far, ear may have potential to heal itself (solved 10% of cases presented) without much interference from external factors (no treatment). But this is still an unresolved issue, as in almost 80-90 % of subjects with hearing issues (different from those listed in first 2 groups above) no connection with causative factors has been established. It seems like a 'black box' - there has to be an underlying basis for this, which at minimum needs to described properly. At the best, one would like to see some efforts toward understanding it. Of note, a similar statement can go for other parts of our body, where 'we see things only when we loose them'.

Question8,Are there any pre-treatment tests to perform on an uncooperative patient?No such tests have been identified in literature. Many patients are unaware that they are apprehensive prior to treatment. Often an anxious patient will become less so as the dental visit proceeds.6;Why is it important to have a relaxed patient during dental treatment?A tense facial muscle mass makes maintaining an intraoral atmosphere conducive to a difficult procedure. A relaxed environment allows for greater patient control during treatment, and helps to reduce the number treatment interruptions. One such interruption is of course patient movement and therefore pain control is also improved.7 Adequate patient opening is a must for a thorough cavity preparation and to avoid procedural mishaps like filling the incorrect tooth, or over prepping due a lack of proper visibility of tooth structure, both of these scenarios lead to unnecessary treatment of your patient as well as increased treatment time and cost.

This results in a variety of symptoms ranging from mild skin redness to life threatening shock . The most common forms of allergy are respiratory allergies which affect up to 40% of the population, food allergie affect 2\u201310 % of population and contact allergens affect between 8% and 13% (the prevalence depends on type of material in question) . However, there are many other triggers that can result in similar symptoms, such as dermatitis or pulmonary fibrosis, so it is important for health care professional to investigate and determine the specific allergin that caused the reaction and to avoid the allergoinitiating agent in order to treat and prevent future reactions .

Question's It is often said that personality develops in infancy and early childhood and by the age of 7 or 8 years is largely fixed or re\u00adlatively inflexible (e.g. Fombonne 2008). Question\u2019s Is this really a view held by most scholars? And, if so, the evidence for this \u201crelative inf Fixity\u201d of personality across childhood (at least from ages 4 or so onward) would be very interesting and potentially useful for our study (it would provide a baseline against which to compare the stability of autonomy in our cohort). Unfortunately, in my view, this section lacks the precision that is needed for us to make use of it in \u201cappraising\u201d the autono\u00admous development of self-concept in early adolescence in Study 3. I suspect that some of this material might be more suitably housed in an introduction to the wider literature on auton\u00adomy than in a section elaborating specific hypotheses/predictions for the study. We would need to see the other \u201chypotheses\u201d sections to really evaluate this. On the positive side, two examples of \u201crelatively late\u201d factors influencing personality are mentioned \u2013 parental divorce and the birth of a sibling \u2013 factors which are relevant to our own study in Trinidad. They would ideally be expanded upon, perhaps in tandem with introduction of hypothesizes regarding the main \u201ceffects\u201d (or moderators, mediators) tested in", "### Answer: If so, what are the criteria for diagnosis, how does one identify and assess this disorder in clinical practice, and how is it treated?

{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.", "Must_have": ["Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth condition, which could lead to greater than average size in infancy and childhood.", "It could result in asymmetric or uneven body appearance due to abnormal growth of specific body parts.", "It could also involve major features like an opening in the abdomen (omphalocele), large tongue (macroglossia), larger than normal abdominal organs (visceromegaly), skin creases or pits near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), kidney abnormalities.", "Children with this syndrome are susceptible to cancerous and noncancerous tumors such as Wilms' tumor and hepatoblastoma.", "These tumors usually appear in childhood."], "Nice_to_have": ["The growth in those with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome tends to slow down by about age 8 and as adults, they are not particularly tall.", "The unusual growth pattern known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.", "Other abdominal wall defects common to this condition include a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia).", "The large tongue could interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speech.", "Most people with this syndrome do not have major medical issues and life expectancy is typically normal."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: 1,What is the life expectancy of someone with BWS?2,Is there a genetic test for BWSp?3,Does BBS have any other symptoms besides the ones listed?4,Are there any treatments for the symptoms of BBB?5,Can a baby with a congenital abnormality of the brain survive?6,How common is BWA?7,Do people with this condition have a higher risk of cancer?8,Will a child with these symptoms grow up to have intellectual disabilities?9,Should I take care of my child\u2019s skin?10,When should I be concerned about my baby\u2019 s size? Question: What is a normal amount of movement felt by mother in womb at different stages of pregnancy? How much movement should one expect at 8 weeks, 20 weeks and 30 week of gestation? What are the normal ranges of fetal movement at these stages? Is there an association between the amount fetus moves and the level of oxygen in the amniotic fluid? If so, what is this association? Does the baby move less when there is less oxygen? Or does the fetuses\u2019 movement cause changes in oxygen levels? These are some of questions that have been asked by researchers in their quest to understand the complex phenomenon of intra-uterine movements. The answers to these questions are not clear and there are many contradictions in what has been written about fetAL movement. This is probably due to the fact that every pregnancy is different and every fetUS is unique. Also, the methods used to measure fetUs movement are different. Some are highly subjective while others are more objective. For example, one method of measuring fetAl movement is to ask the mother to count the movements she feels and then report the number to a health professional. However, this method is highly dependent on the memory and concentration of both the mothers and health professionals involved. It is also dependent upon the ability of mothers to accurately distinguish between fetAn and non-fetAn movements, such as those caused by hiccups or stomach rumbles. Another method, which is more scientific and less prone to error, is using technology such ultrasounds or special sensors to record and count fetAIs movements over a period of time.

However, these initial symptoms are not specific to Parkinsons disease and may develop in people with other health problems as well.The cardinal signs of PD are tremor (within this range of movements, rest tremors are more specific for Parksinsos disease), rigidity, bradykinesia, and motor problems with gait and balance.

Question: 3,What are common triggers of nasal polyps?Possible trairs: allergic rhinitis, aspirin sensitivity and chronic Sinusitis. Question  4,How long does it take for a urinary tract infection to go away?Common UTIs generally resolve within 2 to 5 days after starting antibiotics. If symptoms do not improve within this time frame, a UTI may be considered resistant to antibiotic treatment and a culture-based sensitivity test may help guide the choice of antibacterial agent.5, Is amoxicillin good for urine incontinence?Amoxicon is not recommended for the treatment of urinea incontina. There is inadequate evidence to support this use. The evidence presented does not provide sufficient information to make a decision about the utility of amoxycilllin in this indication.6, Can I use an antifungal mouthwash instead?Mouthwashes containing vinegar or salt water can help prevent plaque formation but will not treat existing plaques. These mouthwashest can either be made at home from a homeor buying them prepared. Antifugal washes can also be bought but there is insufficient evidence for their effectiveness.7, What is probiotica and prebiotic?Pro/prebiotics are nutrients that promote the growth of \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in the gut, they have been shown to reduce intestinal inflammation in some studies but the evidence is inconsistent.8, Should I take an antibibiota if I feel a little sick?Unless you have clear recommendations from your physician or APR the answer is no. Taking antibioatica without prescription or recommendation not only do nothing for you, but they will also damage the microbiota on your gut thereby promoting the overgrowth of bad bacteria and increasing the risk of resistance.9, I also get a yeast infection with oral sex how do I get rid of it?There is a common belief that a warm mouth moisturizes the vagina and reduces the incidence of infection but that is wrong, in fact it helps the yeasts to", "Citrobacater inaedata is a Gram-negative bacilli that causes urinary tract, bloodstream, and other intra-abdominal in in-patients and out- patients. The organism is found in soil and water and is non-toxigenic. It is usually resistant to ampicillin and it is sometimes resists aminoglycosides and sulfamethoxazole. Infections due to this organisms are usually treated with trimethoprim/sulfametoxacil or with fluoroquinolones. Resistance to trimetopr/ sulphamoxasole has been reported. Citrabacter being a part of normal flora, its elimination is difficult and prolonged treatment is needed. Treatment guidelines are not available for some of the citrobaketer in aedta in fections.

Trimetroprmi/ Sulfomethooxizole was the most common treatment used for citribacter urealseptica in this study also. As citrbacter are intrinsically resitant to aantibiotics like amoxicilline and ampicilin, they should be replaced by some other drugs like trimthopriim/ syntometrkine or some good quninolone or resins.

Question: One night, my husband woke me up in the middle of the night; his scrotum was swollen and he was in pain. He couldn\u2019t sleep. I took him to the ER. We spent four hours in triage before we were brought back to an exam room. The doctor examined him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a viral infection.\u201d He didn\u2019thave any suggestions for pain Management because antibiotics won\u2019tenhance the virus\u2019 progression. They did not take my husbands\u2019 pain serious; they took his fever of 38.3 \u00b0C and the fact that his symptoms did go beyond what a typical viril infection would allow; and they dismissed him. At this point, they did bloodwork looking for a STD and some Urine Testing and had him sign up for an appointement for the clinic the next day. Question AnswerB,What are the chances that the infection is bacterial?A,Which type of infection most likely caused his problem?The symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI), but it is also possible that cervical or vaginal inflammation is the root cause. UTIs are relatively common in sexually active adults and are usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. col), a type bacteria of intestinal origin. Other types of bacteria can also cause a UTI, and their identification is important so that specific antibiotic treatment can be provided. However, in this case, the identification of these bacteria will most probably have no impact on the treatment that is prescribed, which will be based on what kindof bacteria is mostlikely to cause this infection, i.e., E.col. If there is no identification it will just delayed the prescription of what would have been the appropriate medication anyways. Additionally, identification takes time and comes at a cost, so it might not even be prescibed where treatment already exists in a form of a generic medication.(Fig. 1) QuestionB is more common than A in most settings.Fig1How to Use the Figures: The images are available as templates.

Question: 6,Is blood loss normal during menstruation?? ?  ### answer: The answer is yes. Blood loss during a menstral cycle can range from 10 to 80 ml. However, if the blood losss is more than 200ml, it is considered abnormal and should be addressed. If the menstural flow is heavy and is associated with dysmenorrhea, the patient should also be evaluated for potential dysfunctional uterus. The patient in this case had a heavy menatural bleeding (8-12 pads/day) for 5 days, with a total loss of 40-50 mls. This is significantly higher than the normal blood looss of PMDD patients (15-25%), and it was associated to dysphoric mood, anxiety, irritability and depressed mood. Therefore, this patient was also diagnosed with PMS. In addition, she was treated with megestrol acetate, and her symptoms improved significantly. 7,What is the difference between PME and PMO?PME is defined as premenstrual dysphasic disorder, while PDM is pre menstrautal spotting.

(p. 5) Question 30,How long do I have to be on \"blood pressure medication\" before it is considered a \"heart attack?\"? \n ### Answer: It would seem to me that a certain time frame (i.e., 1 month, 6 months, a year, etc.) would have a profound effect on how the results of this study are interpreted. If I recall correctly, I believe you state that you started on medications either that day or the day following the ECG, so time spent on the medications would not have been very great which would lend significance to my prior statement about time framing and risk. This is an important issue as it pertains to the future management of these patients with AMI that are hypotensive, especially in the case of ACS, where time is of great importance in getting the patient to a location where the most appropriate management is available. Question; 8,Are PPI drugs harmful? Why are they prescribed?? This review paper highlights the adverse effects related to long term use and excessive amounts of PPIs and states that PPAs should be prescribe,s and used in an appropriate manner.

B, Is CJD always fatal? Where is the spinal fluid collected for testing? And why should one not flush the", "Question: is there anything for tremors? \n ### Answer: No, there isn't. You see, tremor is a sign of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidsm is caused by Graves' antibodies. These antibody attach to thyroid hormone receptors, causing a release of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine(T3) into the circulation. Therefore, the level of these hormones are abnormally high, because they are not regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyriod axis. This is in contrast to what happens with primary (or \"bad\") hypothyroidsm, in which the thyrioder gland is somehow damaged and cannot produce T4 and T3, so the levels of this hormines are low.. Concerning treatment, what can you do for a person with hyperthryroidm? there are several drugs that can be used to treat the symptoms of Grave's disease, such as beta blockers to reduce the heart rate, angiotensin-conversoting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower blood pressue, anti-convulsants to relax muscles, glucocorticoids to suppress the immune system and antithyroid drugs to inhibit the release hof TT from the thighroid gand . And if these medicines cannot control the disease? you can always get a thyiot epidermalization .

Question 2,Can chewable tablets be crushed and used for topical administration? ,In the absence of study to support this idea, it should not be promoted. There are many chewed and swallowed table salt and spices, if it is introduced in the oral cavity, the effect on oral health should be discussed in positive and negative aspects Question3,Is it true that ginseng does not have side effects? .It is reported that there are no significant side effect of ginger in a study by Moon et al. (2018). However in animal studies, giner has been reported to cause stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, fatigue and irritability and hypoglycemia (Moon et. al, 63042). Can genger cause diarhrea? In human, studies show that Ginger cannot cause gastric irritation or diareh. Can it really? The result could be diarea as ginner has glyecrrhizin which is diuretic and could cause fluid elimination thorugh kidney. Maybe a discussion on this point should have a seperate p. No ginet of 0.2 ml caused diaria in human. Thus 5 g of Ginsan could produce about 10 ml of diara in an adult. How much did they used in experimental animal?

Tizzanide acts as an agonist at the alpha-2 and alpha -1 noradrenergic receptors, as well as being a partial aggoist on the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor. There are no reports of adverse interactions between the two drugs. Therefore, it is not deemed necessary to change my treatment. Question  Is it ok to use oxycodone and hydromorphone interchangeably ?  ### answer: If there are adjustments needed in the dose, where do u suggest to start and why? Please provide references of your recommendation if available. FN:Yes, I think it would be safe to begin with 5 mg of oXY codone if the patient was receiving 4 mg BID of hydormor phone. The reason for the recommendation is due to the half-life of each drug. Oxy codon has a shorter half life and will be out of system sooner than hydrmor Phone. For that reason, starting off with a lower does of OXYcodon will prevent over diffusionening and ensure safe and effective treatment.(O\u2019Brien et al., 2017) Question.

Question: Is it safe to take Tylenol and Sudafed together?? ? ? ### answer: ? ?????? Question 1,Is it ok to use a combination of SudAFED and TyLENOL to relieve pain and congestion?No, this is not recommended. SudAfed is a decongestant and pain reliever, and taking too much can cause headache, anxiety, irritability, drowsiness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Ty lenol is an analgesic and antipyretic, taking both together may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects such as n cause: vomit, indigestion, heartburn, ulcers, or pain in the upper right side of the ab domen (where the gall bladder is located). Question2,Can I use SudAfed and pseudoephedrine (found in many combination pain medicines) at the same time?Yes, but not with TyLenol. Pseudoephidrne is another type of de con gestant that can be used with Sud Afed. It is found in combination with many pain medications such acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, hydrocodone, etc. and it can safely be combined with the Sud AFED. But it should not be taken together with TYLENol as this may cause serious side effect. The pseudo ephedrene and the Ty Lenol may have an additive effect on the blood pressure and could cause a dangerous increase in blood pressures. Also the combination may interact with other medications the patient may be taking. Therefore it\u2019s best to avoid combining the two. If the patients needs both the dexhydroepherdine and tyleno l they should consult their doctor or pharmacist. They may provide the with alternative options such a different type de Congestant or a prescription for the pseudo ephiredrone that does not contain the ty leno.

Question: 00,How does oral inhalation therapy work for asthma? \n ### Answer: The concept of inhaling medication through the mouth instead of the nose may seem surprising to many people. However, oral (mouth) in haler therapy is already a well-established form of treatment for several conditions. Oral in-haler devices are used to deliver dry powder for the treatment of cough variants of asthama.11,12 There are two types \u2013 a dry-powder in capsule in vaporizing phase device (DPIs) and a pressurized-metered-dose inserts (pMDIs). In the first type, a capsules containing the lactose monohydrate and the pharmaceutical compound, which delivers the active ingredient is placed in the inset. When the patient in ishale air through his nasal cavity, the capsile is pierced by a rubber seal. The laurose monohetradiate dissolves in inshaled air and releases the mist with active pharmcological ingrediant to the bronchopulmonary region. In case of pMdi, as the patients in shale aerosol through an inssinger the compressed gas in canister propel tha medication in to their lungs. Lactose is used as carrier and propellant for powder particles and serves to increase the diffusion from the carrier to surface of lung whiles reducing the solubility of active particles . Question 1(a),How do I know if I have a kidney infection? (b),Is there any treatment to cure a Cystitis? Question2(c),Do I need an antibiotic?A doctor will decide if you need antibiotics based on the type and severity of infection . The infected area may be swabbed so a culture can be taken and tested for sensitivity to antibacterial agents.If you have been prescribed antibioitcs, it is crucial that you take them as directed by your health care providers.Do not stop or alter the course of your treatment without speaking to your nurse or doctor.

Question: Would the administration of Peppermint oil be safe from the point of view of a transient decrease in blood pressure? Question Question  Is it normal to gain weight when taking diazepam? \n ### Answer: The short answer is no, diazipam and other benzodiazepines do not cause weight gain when prescribed as an anticonvulsant. If weight change occurs, it generally does not happen until after the fourth month of treatment and is more likely with doses above 20mg/day. Weight gain associated with diazepepsin does occur with higher dosage use for anxiety and sleep, and these weight changes may play a small role in the development of DM2 and cardiovascular conditions, though the extent of this effect is not yet clear.

{"Question": "Is dementia inherited? Can one develop dementia without inheriting it?\n", "Free_form_answer": "Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.\n 1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact. 2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder.

Question: What is the difference between Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dements?? ### answer: Alzeheimer's is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, while vascualar deMENTIA is caused by vAScUlar DISEase (CVD) that has caused chronic hypoperfusion of the brain. Alzhiemer'S disease is also associated with APOE4 gene mutation, whereas vASCULAR deMERIT sS more likely to occur in the context of other vaskular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity and so on. In other words, AlZEHIER' S disease affects brain cells directly, causing neuronal death,while vASKULAR DEMENTia damages the BRAIN INDirecTly, resulting in hypoxia and death of brain tissue. The clinical picture in vD is often more acute, with rapid onset of symptoms and sometimes even a sudden collapse. On the other hand, in AlZ, the onSET is more insidious, gradual and often starts with a single symptom, which then progresses over time. Another difference is that AlD can affect people of any age, even under 65, although the risk increases with age. vCD, on the contrary, mainly affects elderly people, over 80, often with other comorbidities. Also, vCI is usually more severe than AlIt, as it affects not only the cerebral parenchyma, but also the white matter and the entire cerebrovascular tree. Finally, there are also differences in terms of imaging, since in ADC the atrophy is greater than in VCI, where the main finding is represented by the presence of lacunes and microinfarcts. However, these two diseases are often found in combination, so the clinical and imagING picture may be similar.

However, hip oA does not always cause pain; rather, pain arises from a number of tissues that will be discussed within.27Osteoporosis, rheumatologic conditions such as rails syndrome, and conditions like Paget\u2019s disease of bone and ankylosing spondylitis also cause hip joint pain.The most feared complication of rrache hip arthrosplasty is a dislocation. 1%-3% of patients undergoing total hip replacement suffer dislocations during the early recovery period. This ranges from 2% to 6% for THA performed through a posterior approach. Dislocated THAs are treated by closed means, which restores normal limb function in the majority of cases. In the event of recurring instability post-dislocation, surgical management is necessary with the use of acetabular and/or femoral revision surgery performed. Rarely, there are instances where acutely displaced fractures secondary to rraachment are accompanied by a lateral or varus wall fracture of either the ipsilateral or contralateral (unilocular) aceticum. Patients who are unable to be resurfed and suffer from pain attributable to the acute fractural component are offered the option of joint arThorax or shoulder girdle disarticulation.

These interruption can be mild, moderate or severe, and can result in disturbed sleep and oxygen starvation. The most serious type of sleep APNOea occurs when theairway is completely obstructed, which can lead to hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and death. This type is called ob Structural sleep disorder0 \u2013 104 Question: 68,When the brain receives signals that the body is not getting enough air, it sends signals to the lungs, heart and muscles to work harder and faster to raise the level of oxygen in our blood. When the signals are received by the muscles, they contract to help move more air in and out of the nose and throat. During REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the contractions are stronger and the result is REMS. REISA can also occur during NREM sleep as well as the wake-sleep cycle.51,69,72 Question 70,How does the Epworth sleepiness scale work?0.67601.253.8<00:05:34.90975 Question : 03,What is erythema nodosum? \n ### Answer: Erythe\u043c\u0430 nodmosm is an inflammatory skin disease, characterized by edema and 2\u20135 cm red nodules mainly in extensor sites like the buttocks, lower extremities and back.

Can I be asymptomatic and still have conjunctivitis? A definitive diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical signs, symptoms, history, and basic laboratory investigations . Inflammation and pus, along with redness and swelling, are typical symptoms of conjuctivitiis. Because of allergic reactions in the eye, the conjcticitial sac may appear to be swollen, red, or in very severe cases, discharging a brown, mucoid fluid. However, severe pain and discomfort are uncommon. Most of all, only a few infected patients will exhibit signs and symptoms early in infection; most patients with conjucitivatis have other typical signs such as red and itchy eyes and a discharge that is often tinged with blood. The history and physical exam are not always reliable for diagnosing conjinctivistis; in one study, nearly a quarter of patients who were referred to a specialty clinic for \u201cinfectious conjungtivits\u201d were found to not have any infection based of their medical record evaluation.

Question: Is there a cure for uva? \n ### Answer: If by cure you mean total visual loss, then no, but there is treatment that can limit visual losses and inflammation. If you are referring to the condition of being a recipient of surgical intervention, the answer is, again, no. The purpose of the surgically induced cataract is to allow the ophthalmologist access to drain the vitreous, which is analogous to opening the front door of a house to stop a fire from spreading (Fig. 2). Question  Is a retinal migraine a serious thing? ?  ###answer: Do people suffer from migraines that affect their vision? This is the one that I am interested in and should be explored in more detail in my opinion. A retinoblastoma is a very rare type of cancer that usually affects one eye and is one of several potential dangers of having a family history of this condition. People can also suffer with a condition called macular degeneration which will eventually result in loss of vision. These two conditions should definitely be mentioned briefly in your article. As for all cancers, early detection is key and if people are aware of any signs and symptoms of reticular migranes they can seek medical attention earlier and more effectively. I really think that you have a great opportunity to achieve your goal of educating people about this lesser-known type or migrane with some amendments to your paper. Please include more information about retnal migrains, how they progress and how people can tell that they are experiencing retimal migrain. Thank you for submitting your work. Hope to see the revised version soon! Question Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined as diseases of our arteries (atheroslerosis) and those coronary artery diseases that lead to angina and myocardial infarction (MI), as well as stroke.The term ASCVD is used to refer to a group of conditions that include stroke, MI, and other coronaries artheriosclzerosis. In the current guidelines, ACC/AHA recommends the use of AASCBD for these conditions.1.What are the major risk factors of coronray diseaseOther major coronartery disease includes", "### Answer: Yes, u veit is an intraocular inflammatory disease in which the immune response is directed at one or more components of the eye, including the retina, lens, vitreous cavity, and optic nerve. The autoantigens in uvetis may be in the group of anterior u venous proteins or be derived from retinal antigencies. Question: 73,What is meant by an allergy? Question 96,Knowledge of asthma is important because it helps to:98 Understand (the definition of) astma.99 Recognise asthmatic children.100 Recall astmatic symptoms.58,Recognising depression in children: is it important and how?The importance of recognising and diagnosing depression and some methods or pointers for parents/caregivers on how to identify a child with depression: Do you think depression should be diagnosed in some young children even if they don\u2019t have a parent or caregiver-reported adjustment disorder?Yes, I do think so, but it is very challenging, especially in very young ones. Please explain more.I totally agreeIt is difficult but not impossible. For example: a very angry child who is irritable, crying a lot and has trouble concentrating, may end up being diagnosed as depressed when they are in fact suffering from Adjustment Disorder.The diagnostic criteria for depression vary with age. This article, which seems to be targeted at English-speaking populations (or at least uses English as the main reporting language) does not clarify that there are different criteria based on age, except for a Table at the end which only has the DSM-5 version. I found it quite shocking that the authors would report on \u201cdepression\u201d, when it seems clear they were assessing the children between the ages of 8 and 12 years, yet didn\u2019 t know that this would be \u201cchildhood depression\u201d vs \u201cadjustment disorders\u201d. The authors must clarifiy this important issue.In fact, only Question(84,93) of this study was conducted in accordance with the Checklist for Reporting Results of internet E-Survey studies (CHERRIES) . In this case, the checklist was supplemented with two additional items, on the basis of a published commentary on CHERR", "Answer: The answer is no. Uvea is an immune-privileged site, and as such, uvaeitic antibodies often do not have access to the circulation and therefore are not useful as a diagnostic test or in the assessment of intraocular inflammatory activity 10.

An organ donation board will", "Is u veitis a disease of the auto immune system?It has been postulated that u.ve tis an A. disease and a significant number of patients with this disease have evidence of a specific auto-immunologic mechanism participating in its development. The pathopysiology appears to be complex and may also include a role for viral antigens and environmental triggers.The u,ve system is a highly organized innate and acquired immune defense system consisting of three barriers: Corneal epithelium, conjunctival mucosa and u.,ve.tis.This helps the system in recognizing the infective agents and also inactivating them.These three physical barriers are integrated with the cells of immune System and their products.Both cell mediated and humoral mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of u.(Autoimmunity is the failure of self-tolerance of cells and tissues which leads to their destruction by the immunesystem. In autoim-mune u-vectitis, self tolerance is lost and the autoreactive T and B lymphocytes attack and destroy the antigenic elements of their host. They are present in normally immuneprivileged sites, such as the u.-ve-system, due to unknown reasons.)Several theories have been pro-posed regarding the cause of auto immunity in genetically predisposed individuals.It is hypothesized that the breaching of one or more of these barriers by a viru-sal or bacterial path-ogen is an important trigger for auto-(allo)immuno-neural reactions , and thus the basis of an abnormal immune response to non-self may arise from a response originally intended to destroy a patho-gen that gets out of control and attacks the host\u2019s healthy tiss-ues, thereby causing auto(Allo) immune responses and damage. (Mackay and Jackson, 2004) Question: 0,How does a person get botulism? \n ### Answer: Clostridium botulinum can occur in food, the environment, and inside the bodies of persons who have bot-ulosis. 10.5016/S1223-2585(18)30244-XFigure 5.How can a child get Botulium?", "269.Yes, urethritis is an STD. Therefore, some types of uvecystitis may be due to reflux of bacteria from an infected urogenital tract, rather than auto-immunity. On the other hand, there are some suggestions of an immunologic etiology, e.g. positive association with rheumatoid arthitis and HLA B27, but data are conflicting. Question: 141,Is vaginitis caused by sex? \n ### Answer: What is the cause of vaginal itching and burning? What factors increase the risk of developing vagininitiathe symptoms of vulvar eczema? Can sexual activity affect the symptoms? Question 20,Are vitiligo areas prone to auto immune? The auto immunity hypothesis has been proposed for vitilligo etiopathogenesis. This hypothesis requires that vitilego areas be prong to autimmunity. The results show that the vititigo skin has immune activity that is different from normal skin, and the auto antigen created by SSR1 may play a pathogenic role in the occurrence and repopulation of vitliigo.These findings support theautoimmume hypothesis ofvitiligosisand indicate a possible pathway to test it. However, many other factors are also involved in vitligo autoinmune mechanism, which needs more research. In addition to the immune system, the role of other vitilitygo pathogene factors also needs to be considered. More studies are required to explore this problem, so as to provide a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.172, 322 Question21 923.76 Is atrophy of the penis serious?The atropys of penis is serious,which can lead to erectile dysfunction.2*10^5\u20138* \u2a2f1\u25ca150.Risk of erecrile disfunctionR28093,Atrophic penis can be repaired?NoYes 5*\u257312 = 60 NoYes162QP294038,Erectile tressure is normal after treatment for prostate cancer?NormalYes5367 \u201330*Yes2\u2c9a"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4355, "rouge1_r": 0.0922, "rouge1_f1": 0.1521, "rouge2_p": 0.1148, "rouge2_r": 0.024, "rouge2_f1": 0.0397, "rougel_p": 0.2581, "rougel_r": 0.0546, "rougel_f1": 0.0901, "bleurt": 0.2516, "bert_score_p": 0.7565, "bert_score_r": 0.8318, "bert_score_f1": 0.7924, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1543}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4194, "rouge1_r": 0.0712, "rouge1_f1": 0.1218, "rouge2_p": 0.0984, "rouge2_r": 0.0165, "rouge2_f1": 0.0282, "rougel_p": 0.2903, "rougel_r": 0.0493, "rougel_f1": 0.0843, "bleurt": 0.2892, "bert_score_p": 0.7882, "bert_score_r": 0.8278, "bert_score_f1": 0.8075, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1215}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3871, "rouge1_r": 0.0688, "rouge1_f1": 0.1168, "rouge2_p": 0.0492, "rouge2_r": 0.0086, "rouge2_f1": 0.0147, "rougel_p": 0.2419, "rougel_r": 0.043, "rougel_f1": 0.073, "bleurt": 0.2426, "bert_score_p": 0.7841, "bert_score_r": 0.8254, "bert_score_f1": 0.8043, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1296}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3548, "rouge1_r": 0.0651, "rouge1_f1": 0.11, "rouge2_p": 0.0492, "rouge2_r": 0.0089, "rouge2_f1": 0.0151, "rougel_p": 0.2742, "rougel_r": 0.0503, "rougel_f1": 0.085, "bleurt": 0.2696, "bert_score_p": 0.7749, "bert_score_r": 0.8156, "bert_score_f1": 0.7948, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.146}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4516, "rouge1_r": 0.0862, "rouge1_f1": 0.1447, "rouge2_p": 0.0492, "rouge2_r": 0.0093, "rouge2_f1": 0.0156, "rougel_p": 0.3065, "rougel_r": 0.0585, "rougel_f1": 0.0982, "bleurt": 0.3022, "bert_score_p": 0.7839, "bert_score_r": 0.8237, "bert_score_f1": 0.8034, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.146}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4194, "rouge1_r": 0.0942, "rouge1_f1": 0.1538, "rouge2_p": 0.0984, "rouge2_r": 0.0218, "rouge2_f1": 0.0357, "rougel_p": 0.2903, "rougel_r": 0.0652, "rougel_f1": 0.1065, "bleurt": 0.2425, "bert_score_p": 0.7771, "bert_score_r": 0.8334, "bert_score_f1": 0.8043, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1581}]}

Can chronic itch be cured? Itching is a very unpleasant sensation, which can lead to severe consequences, especially when it occurs on a large scale.Itching, medically known as pruritus, is caused by the activation of prurticeptors, often located in or beneath the skin. Prurtceptormedian nerve connection is involved in it, so it is common to experience it during the night and early morning. In fact, it often interferes with sleep.If the cause of it remains unidentified and/or is not treated, there is an risk of secondary skin lesions, either mechanical, friction- or pressure-induced, or bacterial.Severe pricking and mechanical stimulation can induce numbing of sensory, even if the itchiing stops.Scratching activates sensorial and primitve Itch-scratch cycle, leading to skin inflammation and increasing the risk for bacteral invasion.Liver diseases, such as cholestasis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer and other", "33.How many ounces of water should a human drink daily?45.What is the best way to get dehydrated?66.Drink 8-10 cups of fluids daily.24 What are the 5 types of bladders problems? 15,What are 3 symptoms of a blister?9,Why is my urinary urgency?23,I pass dark urines.

This recommendation reflects a shift in vaccine strategy to prevent shinge limp from the \u201czostavax\u201d vaccine toward the more effective \u201cshringrix\u201d Vaccine. \u201cShringls\u201d is a recently FDA approved and is recommended for adults aged >5? yrs old, including health care workers. Zoostax is only recommended by in people who are either immune compromised and/or are going to receive high doses of corticosteroid therapy. A study published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases in 2018 found that shringles offered robust protection against shings and chicken pox disease from ages 70 to 99 years. The results suggest that the vaccine should be used regardless of age to protect against both shinguish and varichivus. Question: In the study, shringe vaccine was found to be 87% effective in preventing shinke infection and 67-71% in reducing the severity of symptoms (defined as painful or uncomfortable rash with blisters or sores). However, there are conflicting data on how long the protection lasts after a single dose. In one study shrings vaccine conferred protection for about 13 years, while in another it was 4 years for the prevention of shinging and at least 30-years for prevention against chicken box. If you look at what the CDR is recommending for Booster Status or \u201cVaccination Record\u201d for Healthcare Workers (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/healthcare-workers.html), they are recommening two dosese of vaccine and NO MATERIAL (e.g., serologic test result or evidence of prior infection) is adequate to replace the need for a 02544M5, Question  when is mumps contagious?2Mp1P1 \u03b2 = \u2205Mumps virus is contage: rious during the prodromal phase and during outbreaks \u03b1", "### Answer: When can I receive a shINGles (Zostavax) vaccine?: You should postpone vaccination if you are currently undergoing chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy.

Question: Can a baby receive botox? If so, how young is too young? Question 7: Is vaccinate a vaccine for hep B? Can babies get hepatitis B from the vaccines?The data on the safety of heparin B vaccine were based on a group of 10,009 infants who received vaccine at birth and 44 infanuts who did not receive the vaccine. No local or systemic reactions to vaccinated infans were observed. Among the non vaxxants, 8 (17.8%) babies had hepadnitis, with a high rate of neonatal hematitis of (60%). Vaccine-derived hepratitis is rare and results from a delayed first dose of HepB vaccine administered within 24\u201396 h of birth; therefore, strict adherence to the recommended schedule should minimize this risk12. In another study conducted with 91 babies who weighed \u22651501 g and were \u226427 days old, the incidence of local and systemtic adverse vaccine reactions was 56% (35 infats) and they were transitory. The most common adraves were fever and jaundice (26 infatus). In 0\u201348 h after injection, local swelling, redness and pain was noticed at the injection site in \u224880%.

Currently there is no vaccine licensed for use in the United States toprevent shigeilla infection. However a number of vaccines are under development and are being tested in studies. These include both live and inactivated vacciness, and some are designed to be used in infants and others in older adults. Studies of these vacciunes are at various stages, including early tests of safetyand immune response in adults, to larger efficacy trials in children and adults in both high income and lower income countries.

It involves detecting a protein biomarker called PI228p/258. However, this test is not widely available and is currently being evaluated for diagnostic use. Question3,The doctor says that I only have asthma, but I also have another condition that causes wheezing. What could it be? Respiratory syncitial virus (RSV). RSV is the most common cause of wheozing in children, and it is also the single greatest cause worldwide of hospitalization for lower respirator tract infections in infants and children. Additionally, it can cause disease in the older population. When coupled with the fact that it remains the same in both children and adults, the prevalence, morbidity, mortality, associated costs; the need for a vaccine or other preventative measure is evident. As such, there are several pharmaceutical interventions currently undergoing pre-clinical and clinical testing, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, fusion proteins, nanoparticles and a handful of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with promising results. These interventive measures will be briefly described later. This article is meant for primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, physiotherapists, pharmacists and other healthcare providers that are interested in learning more about this common viral infection and its current management. Understanding this virus and the preventive options available could help at-risk patients in our care, improve patient-physician communication and enhance our ability to relieve suffering.4,3M,5,2M+I2 Question4 Question5 11,Why does my ear hurt and feel blocky?

The last line of the paragraph, and the discussion as a whole, suffer from the same problem:The authors seem to want to make a points about the clinical relevance of these findings, probably in terms of guiding diagnosis or management. If that\u2019s the case, then I think they need to do a better job of linking the findings to what happens in practice. Alternatively, they can take Question 9,Do I have hemorrhoids or an anal fistula?QuackeryThe name of a medical organization or practitioner is mentioned, either directly or by inference, in a derogatory manner.10,Could my rectal bleeding be fatal?Asshattery (and variants)The patient complains of rectall bleeding, there is some clinical or laboratory hint of serious blood loss, yet the health professional dismisses or overlooks this, on the grounds that the patient is constipated or suffering from hemorroids; often with the implication that such patients are trying to feign or exaggerate their illness. This finding was strongly linked to the idea of patients with chronic complaints being regarded as difficult or unwelcome patients.

However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase.

Question  84,Is sick eye contageouous? \n ### Answer: This is where we would normally say \u2018no, not resp. tr.\u2019, but this would assume that inhaling the \u2018sick eyes\u2019 wouldn\u2019t cause infection, which seems unlikely given how we understand transmission of these agents. In fact, we\u2019re not even sure if this means \u2018not respiratory\u2019 \u2013 it could just mean not through the eyes! We are reminded of a story about a passenger on a cruise ship who cut his foot on the floor and infected everyone on board with anthrax simply by showing them his leg \u2013 so we don\u2019 t know how this virus would be transmitted, but it\u2019s a different example of how a single source can contaminate everyone else, as you have here. We also know that E.coli, S. aureus etc, are everywhere \u2013 in fact they\u2019 re all over this article \u2013 how do we know we aren\u2019 know what to be scared of them? I think it just means we get scared if we come into contact w someone who is sick (for whatever reason), and it (any of it) could be that we just don t understand how it happens or why it only happens to some people (despite being exposed to the same thing). Question Question I came into this with zero knowledge on viruses and immune system. This article was a good foundation to build knowledge but I found a few areas that could use expanded or additional explanations.I completely agree that this is important research and I appreciate the ground work the author has put into it. I also think that it is vital to explain why this information is needed or how having this knowledge will impact people\u2019 s lives in a positive way.In the introduction, the authors should provide more information about the immune response and how vaccines work (not just vaccine basics, how immune cells interact with vaccinations and why certain people need extra shots).The introduction and abstract could benefit from a conclusion that summarises the", "Is shingle\u2019s virus spread from person to person?

Nail traumaB. DrugsC. Fungal infectionD. Zika virusThe correct answer is C. Black nail, Nails should be darkened by the drug used in hydrotauch therapy.The result of hydrotaulch is a blackened nail. The black color is caused by compression and congestion of blood under the nails. This typically resolves after the discontinuation of therapy (Takahashi et al. 1998).Nail discoloration that occurs due to traumatising the root of fingernails, or any part of it, is usually restricted to the area that was injured, and thus will appear as stains or as a partial transverse or ganglion cyst. In some cases it causes the detachment of nails (Olusanya et a.2017).Black nails are also a common finding in smokers, perhaps caused the nicotine, which stained the fingertips, thereby causing the black discolouration. Furthermore, it is common in people who do not cut their nails properly, as they can become more difficult to cut due also to their exposure to tobacco smoke and possibly soiled / contaminated with dirt or organic compounds in their occupation or environmental exposure.N/Ap7.

It is used in veterinary medicine to treat inflammation & immunological disorders. Question 4,Can you get Covid if you are vaccinated? Can you transmit it? Vaccination reduces the risk of infection, yet even vaccination does not provide 0% risk. And what about risk to others? A few dozen studies from around the world have evaluated the ability of vaccines to prevent transmission. All show that vaccinations substantially reduce transmission, including of the Delta variant. So, no, vaccinating yourself will not leave you more vulnerable to infection. But yes, you can still get infected. Even a COVID-19 vaccine can\u2019t eliminate all risk; people vaccined against COVID can get sick with the virus. However, vaccine provides significant protection, even against Delta. Further, the vaccinted are less likely to spread COVID to other. Venn: a vaccine is not supposed to provide \u2018significant protection\u2019 against \u2018disease\u2019, it\u2019s to reduce the severity of illness and prevent death. Few studies have looked at how effective COVID vaccine will be in preventing people from getting sick, most studies merely assess efficacy in reducing symptoms.,.i.e if u look at the original Lancet article describing how effexor and tessalan perlese were found to be effective, there was no reduction in \u2018 disease\u2019 as they simply looked a symptomatic case and control group, this is what we traditionally look for, however it is now established that asymptomatics can transmit the disease-so symptomental reduction isnt a great measure of vaccine effectiveness in this pandemic, hence why itis now focus on curbing hospitalisations & deaths.

Question. 43441,Methane-respiring bacteria are not associated with a specific phyla. They are distributed in most of the known archaeal phylum, with the exception of Euryarchaeota. Currently, the dominant view defines methanogenic archaea as a distinct phlyum I. Therefore, methane respiration is no longer considered a distinctive feature of a given phual. As the methylotrophic and methano-genic bacteria distribute in almost all the archaeological phlum and because the ability to respire methaerotropic and to reduce nitrate and sulphur compounds are common features of most methanaogen bacteria, it is proposed to define the physiology of these methanal bacteria as hallmark feature and split the former phum into thwe following new phrems: Crenarchaota and Eurarchota (for details see: Ferry, 947). 76,77 Question Question  56318,I have a red eye.

Question 1,What is the difference between a cold and the flu?Colds are caused by a virus, while the influenza virus causes the illness known as the \u201cflu.\u201d Colds and flu share some common symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. The main difference is that a flu infection is causedby the Influenza virus while a viral cold is not. Also, flu symptoms usually come on suddenly, are more severe, may include a high fever and/or vomitting, last 7- 8 days,and may lead to pneumonia or other complications. Cold symptoms are usually mild, comeon gradually, do not usually include fever or vomit,last 5-7 days and are less likely to leadto complicatons.2,Is it possible to have both a Cold and Flu at the same time?Yes,it is possible. Since the viruses that cause coldsand the virus that causes flu are both respiratory viruse, they can infect the nose and throat atthe same timeto produce the disease.3,", "Methyl Prednisoline is a synthetic corticosteroid that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including: allergic reactions, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.

It is used to treat inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, lupus erythematosus, arthritis and in preventing allergic reaction in asthma and lowering a person's immune response especially in organ transplant patients. How it works? When corticosteroid medications are inhaled, they enter the nose and affect areas in both the upper and the lower part of your lungs. If the inhalation device is effective, medication will only be delivered to the lungs and airways so that you take fewer total puffs of medication. Less medication in your system leads to fewer side-effects. When your medication is delivered accurately, at the right time, in a comfortable, controlled manner by an in effective machine, the medication can do its job better. 70, How do I get the most out of my puffer?

Its primary actions are to increase the release of norepinephrine and dopamine into the brain and to inhibit the reuptake of these neurotransmitters. It is also used to suppress appetite in the treatment of obesity and as a nootropic agent to improve cognitive function.However, methyphenadate acts by dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms, while modafinil acts through its inhibition of the synaptic vesicle monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), thus preventing the vicious cycle of sleep deprivation.Differences between modfalir and methphnidat:In terms of pharmacology, modofil will take longer to work and will remain active in body longer compared with methphedate. On the other hand, with respect to sleep, taking modfdil after already having sleep in a quantity that has not been fully obtained may have less benefit compared to taking methyldate at that time point.I think that modfa does exert a sustained wakefulness effect, and a more robust effect on the sleep maintenance cycle, compared MPH as illustrated in Figure 3.In contrast MPD may be better at promoting sleep onset, as it is taken at a time when tiredness and sleep drive is present. In the study by Chee et al. MDA was given at 12 am & 6 am. At 8 Mpd?the effects pf sleep were less than with Mop on wake at the same times. This suggests moda may effect sleep homeostasis more than MPh does.

It anti-inflammtory activity is derived from suppressing the production of pro- inflmmatmatnry mediators such as the enzymes cyclooxygenase and lipoxyogenase, and the release of cytokines. Such suppression mediated indirectly through reduction of the number of circulating leukocytes. This drug also has antibacterial and anti fungal activity that is independent of its suppresion of inflammation.(34, 35) Question: 5 what are the side effects of methotrexate medication?

Question  When should I be concerned about a rise in AST? [Link] You should be worried when it exceeds 40 u/l. Or when combined with jaundice and/or alkaline phosphatase. This is commonly seen in hep A and hepatitis like syndrome with a quick resolution. I am more worried about your negative serum IgG. You are probably unable to fight off many infections because of this. That could really put you in a terrible situation. Please get this fixed as soon as possible. On the one hand, I would advise to do some kind of physical activity (like pushing yourself to exercise lightly) on the other hand I do think your body has to rest somehow. So do both if you possible can. Take care. And if this is because you were working outside please get a recommendation from your work to get on sick leave or something so you can get well soon. In other words, please take the necessary time to recover as this will only cost you one week, whereas if it would have been Covid and you would had to go to the hospital, or even lose your life, that\u2019s a whole different story.

YesYesYes (With patient knowledge and consent) Question Question 9,How did the physician and the specialist treat you when you received a diagnosis of a fibroid? \n ### Answer: This question was: \u201cPhysicians and specialists treated me badly when they said I had a uterine tumor. They made me feel like I would die\u201d. This patient experienced an extreme negative affective reaction to being diagnosed with a \u201ctumour\u201d, which affected her emotional state, whereas the other patients reported more moderate negative feelings. The use of \u201cbad\u201d to describe the care they received was also striking, suggesting a sense of betrayal or lack of appreciation for her feelings, which may have been influenced by a lack rapport prior to the diagnosis. This feeling came across strongly in her narrative, coloured by her experience of being stigmatized by healthcare providers, as she expected them to focus on finding a cure rather than preparing her for a life with the disease. In contrast, this theme was not found in any of her fictional narrative interviews.It is possible that these initial feelings may be more intense and may intensify over time, resulting in greater difficulty in developing effective coping strategies and adjusting to living with an incurable diagnosis such as cancer. Alternatively, these feelings could serve as a motivation for greater effort in adjustment and copings strategy development for these patients. For example, feelings such being prepared \u201cfor every scenario\u201d, described by P4, may initially be linked to a desire to cope in future encounters with healthcare professionals.

I am asking this because this compound is used in treatments and you mentioned that natural products can have side effects due to the chemical compound they have in common. If this is the only compound that they share, then I would say it is not a good example. However I think it would be better to explain this better QuestioncWe agree with you that it might not be a great example since it's not an herbal medicine. But we were struggling to find an example of a \"side effect\" that fits the criteria. That is, a compound used for a long time in traditional medicine, shown to have a biological activity (potentially harmful to humans or animals), often used as a treatment today. It was the best example we could find. I feel, there are so many drugs which are derived from traditional medicines. And it seems they are used more like modern drugs (synthetic chemical). That means lots of them have replaced the natural herbs by their derivatives, so the herb and its derivate become \u201ctwo different\u201d things (in terms of biological activities/side effects). QuestiondYes, natural compounds can cause side effectsf (this is one of our points of view) and an illustrative example is what you mention in your comment.

Thank you. I am a kinesthiologist and I struggle with this as I have patients who have no idea their bodies are doing thing like shivering because of NMS. a simple checitubule at night to stop tingling, or foot moving while resting can add 30-6o minutes to an hour depending on the person, thus the percentage of control that person has is now decreased by 4-5%.

However, in cases of prolonged or repeated exposure to electric current, there may be nerve damage, which may affect swallow . Question: 09,Can electrolyte imbalance cause seizure? \n ### Answer: Yes, electroleyte disturbance can cause ictures. The association between electroliw and the propensity to seize has been consistently demonstrated in large population-based epidemiologic studies (19\u201321). Although the mechanism is unclear, associations between multiple individual electroiles and seizures have been recognized. These include low levels of sodium, potassium and calcium, and high levels (or fluctuations) of magnesium (22). The electrophysiological effects of disturbed electroilitye on excitatability of the brain have also been described. This makes sense: one of our physiologichomeostatic mechanisms is to Variations of extracellular electroile concentration can alter the balance between excitation and inhibition in the milieu ofthe brain, thus inducing epileptic seizueses (Figure 2) (40). Electrolytes also direct affect neuronaltransmission by altering the release of neurotransmitters. Thus, calciumbinding proteins have a direct effect on the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while changes in extrastical magneiime concentrations alter neuromediator release, including glutamate and gama amino muricate acid. Alterations in these and other transmitters have long been known to influence seizurogenicity. It appears that there is aspecies, age and condition-dependent hierarchy of electroilities that influence excitability (35). In a large seizue study, an association was seen between serum electroiile disturbances and epilitypeptogenicity (61), particularly a low level of serummagnesium. In the same study hypocalcemia and hypomagnesian were associated with increased risk of postictal coma (75, 76). Question  S,Is electromagnetic energy associatedwith environmental pollutants?

Question Question ,Can encephalitis be cured? ,Encepphalitis is a serious infection of brain 1  , Can this brain infection go undetected? Yes, encepahalities can go untatedect. In fact, this is quite common. By the time symptoms are identified, many patients are already in a coma. This infection is very difficult to diagnose early. Encepahelitis cases are increasing, but there is no timely treatment because of misdiagnosis. If en", "### Answer: No. Electric shock does not affect the ability to swallow. Any damage to the swallow occurs after the time of the injury, by edema affecting the nerves controlling the pharynx and the spasm or paralysis of recurrent laryngeal nerve with excessive secretion of mucus in the glottic area.1.344946E-16 Question: Can electric shock affect fetal movement?? ?  ### answer: Electric and magnetic fields do not cause direct effects on the fetus (29). Question 19,Can eyelid benign tumors be cancerous?What are the differences between eyalid malignant and benmignant tumor s?Eyelids are part of skin, and have same type of tumurs like face and skin.Both mammary (skin) and eyed lid tumus are same in pathologic types and misdiagnosis are possible.Malignent tumours have potential to metastasize. Question20, Can eye cancer be cured?Are there different types of eye cancers?Is eye cncer curable?Can eye tumour be treated?There are different kinds of treatments for eye caencer, depending on ther type and stage of cancer. Some can be successfully treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, but there are certain types that can\u2019t be completely cures. Interception of early stages is important to guarantee cancer of eyes prevention (30\u201333). A.All typesB. MelanomaC. LentoscopyD. RetinoblastomaE. Uveal melanomafThe chances of cure when the eye is tumuor is small, if discovered early it can usually be removed along with the unaffected part. If the cancer is already extensive, the treatment aims to stop the tumur from growing and causing further damage. In most case, this can managed with accurate diagnosis and proper follow-up care (8, 9) Question Question, Is it contagious ??How is it spread? Is there a vaccine?Will I get it from my pet? Can I give it to mypet? Are the statistics accurate? Question1,Is it airborne? How does one get infected? What is the incubation period? Does vaccine availability determine infectedness? If yes", "Yes No19,8,What foods should be avoided if you have swallow difficulty?\"Solid\" foods (any consistency) and liquid consistency \"pill\" supplements should both be considered as potentially choking hazards. Food should always be cut in piece small enough to allow safe swallow. Question: 16,Can empyema be cured? \n ### Answer: No, pneumonia, parapneumonic effusion, and emphysema can result in permanent disability. Drainage and antibiotics are used to treat the condition and improve lung function, although oxygen therapy may be needed in some cases. Lobectomy is reserved for cases with excessive bleeding or recurrence after drainage . Survival rate is difficult to determine because of variable prognosis and different definitions of cures. This report includes 2 patients who have had no evidence of recurrent disease for more than 5 years. 4 deaths, including palliative care cases and cases that received lung resection, have been reported in recent literature within 6 to 36 months, despite no recurrences at the time of death. [7, 8]. Question  778.00,Is emulsion formation normal?Adding surfactant to BAL causes emulsification, which is considered normal. Emulsions may even form in the lungs of patients without added surfactsant as a result of chemical instability of pulmonary surf Actant lipids, in particular the hydrophobic surfActant. Bjure et al, using polarized light microscopy, showed emuli\ufb01cation in patients with diffuse lung disease . Question. What is the best treatment for otitis media? The treatment is divided into \ufb01ve major categories: (1) passive options, such as using \ufb02uid inotics, enhancing Eustachian tube (ET) function and ventilation tube insertion; (2) active options including antibiotic, anti\ufb02ud, ENT surgery and corticosteroids. Because there is no robust evidence for one treatment modality over another, the choice of treatment plan is at an \u201cart and science\u201d stage and requires the physician to apply his expertise and experience after considering the available evidence. We may conclude that this is one of the areas that needs more research to come to a consensus on the \u201cbest treatment\u201d. Question :", "### Answer: Electrical high-voltage shock can cause a variety of injuries to the body, including the head and neck, where the victim\u2019s mouth may remain closed due to muscle spasms, resulting in swallowings problems, and the individual may breathe in water or food into the airway, leading to suffocation or death. It can also cause damage to nerves and muscles involved in movement and sensation, which could result in long-term swallowin problems.233739760 Electronic damage has many effects on nerve cells, such as cell death (apoptosis or necrosis), changes in cell properties (such as excitability, ion channel function, neurotransmitter receptor density, etc.), demyelination, regeneration and plasticity, all of which can lead to changes. in nerve function (including in terms of transmission speed and efficacy of signals between nerve cell), which may be the basis for various sequelae,suchas pain,limb weakness,loss of sensation and other symptoms in patients with spinal cord injury.

They are often found in people who perform heavy physical work, such as lifting.Schmorl nodes can be detected through radiologic testing like X-rays, CT scans or MRIs and are considered a common finding in spinal imaging. The diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other causes of back pain.

PPT: PAGET\u2019S disease is a skeletal disorder of unknown etiology characterized by abnormal bone turned over. It is clinically diagnosed by the following (in any combination): bone enlargement; distorted and deformed bone; and pathological fractures. The most common sites of PDBG: pelvic; spine; skull; tibia; femur; humerus. X-rays are the diagnostic modality of choice. Histological examination reveals a distortion of bone structure due to the abnormally shaped osteocytes, bone cells within the mineralized bone matrix. Most cases are sporadic with multifactorial origin. Occasional transmission from one generation to another has also been described. Sometimes, it can be associated to certain diseases such as fibrous dysplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, aneurysmal bone cyst, Pryswer-Robin syndrome.", "32 , What is the best way to treat Schroml\u2019s Nodes? ? 48 , Is any kind of bracing useful??What is Osteochondritis dissecans of the hip?46,Is this related to Schorml\u2018sNodes?FDD, OOAc, PPC, BDD?

It refers to the temporary in ability to send signals from one's brain to one`s muscles, which leads to complete or partial paraparesis.It can also be accompanied by hallucinations, vivid or vividlessness, and a feeling of choking or pressure, depending on several factors such as drug use, psychological factors, sleep deprivation, or other medical disorders such hyperture of the cerebral aqueduct, hydrocephalus and other conditions.The sleep Institute stated that a normal sleeper cycles through 5 phases of sleep several times in one night: namely, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, REM (rapd eye medulla)sleep; and within NREMSleep, there are 2 further phases: phase I and II. According to this Institute, approximately 70% of a sleep period is dedicated to NRem sleep and the rest to REMSlumber.During NMREMsleeps, the brain waves exhibit distinct oscillations: in early sleep (phase I), they are slow, while in deep sleep(phase II),they are faster in frequency and shorter in peak height.When entering the REMs phase, all brain areas cease cortical and sub-cortical activity except for 3 regions: the periaquedactal gray (responsible for sleep movement), the thalamus, responsible for relaying signal cortically and dredging of subcornial structures. During this phase of deep, uninterrupted sleep an individual can be parailed for experimention. Sleep walking and sexually dimorphic dreams are a result of residual activity of certain parts of these brains (Midbrain and pons, respectively).In this condition the patient is unable to parald his limb completely and thus, could lead to injure himself by falling from bed or hitting the walls while sleepwalking. Because of this risk sleep walking is considered as a disorder. 4/5 of all cases of sexsomnia present with sleep-walk at some point in the disorder, half of those with violent behavior while others only perform simple motor activity like picking up the lower part of their legs and moving them in a kicking motion while falling asleep. Question: 03,", "### Answer: Sleep parapysis is a frightening and sometimes painful experience that often occurs as a consequence of sleep disturbances. It involves the feeling of being aware but paralyzed as sleep commences or during sleep. Some people experience severe anxiety during the episode, and some report hearing loud noises, such as buzzing or ringing, or feeling as though someone is pressing on their forehead or eyes. Question: 41,What is sloughing skin? -Human skin, necrotic or dried, that has sloughed off from the layers of live skin beneath. 5\u201310% body weight in protein is normal epidermal loss during a severe burn; however, loss of 70\u201390 % of body thickness at the wound site has been reported in some patients .

W2 admits that she cannot recall the last time she had urinated prior to this event. A foul smelling discharge was noted by W4 earlier in day. No injury or symptoms were noted", "29 Question: 7,What is sleeping with the lights on? Why is it bad? In the scientific community, there is uncertainty regarding the dangers of exposure to light during sleep. On the one hand, studies conducted in animals indicate that light stimuli of specific wavelengths at specific times during the subjective night can reinstate certain characteristics of sleep, such as muscle tone, breathing pattern, and brain-state stability. This is interpreted to imply that the sleep-promoting effects of light are not completely understood. In humans, research results are inconsistent; there seems to be an effect of short-wavelength light to delay sleep onset, but the effects on sleep architecture are unclear. Question Question  8,Might certain odors or pheromones wake up a sleeper? Some studies indicate the possibility of wake-up odor cues for humans (Ossenkopp & Dorm Answer: We used 50 \u03bcl of the synthetic blends on a 1-cm2 disc. Because the subjects slept in their own beds, we used a diffuser (Fisher Paykin 390-0247) instead of applying the blended chemicals directly to the bed linens as in earlier studies (Dorm answered: \u201cThe diffusers were placed on the nightstands so that they wafted up onto the beds.\u201d Question Answer 9,Do certain sounds keep people awake at night? Can sounds promote sleep? Sleep-disturbing sounds include noises from TVs, radios, music, telephones, microwaves, refrigerators, air conditioners, fans, vacuum cleaners or other power tools, & garbage disposals. Sounds which promote relaxation and sleep include white noise, sounds from a tape recorder or radio played at a low volume, or sounds such a fan or heater. The most important thing is to find a sound which is pleasing to you and which can drown out the other noisier sounds which prevent sleep.. QuestionAnswer10,How does daytime nap affect a person? Does it help to restore energy or does a nap disturb the normal rest-awake rhythm of day and night, harming a persons health? Nap is generally beneficial, especially to children and older persons. Naps among the elderly frequently include day or night changes in sleep patterns, known as parasomnias.

Myotomy has been suggested as an effective treatment. However, some studies have shown that myotonomy does not provide long-term relief. What are your thoughts? Question 2,What is best for acid reflux? A. Proton pump inhibitors B. Antacids C. Alginates D. H2 blockers Question3,How long does it take for an ulcer to heal? The time it takes for the ulcers to cure depends on the cause of the injury, the size of ulcus and the treatment method. In general, it can take 4 to 6 weeks for small ulers to completely heal, while larger ulces or those in high-stress areas may take longer. The healing process can be monitored by endoscopy. Once the diameter of a peptic ulcr is reduced to less than 3 mm, treatment can usually be stopped. Relapse is common if the underlying cause is not treated. For example, if a patient has continued exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the peptics ultr will most likely recur. Therefore, eradication of Helicobacter pylori, stopping the offending drug, or changing the NSAID to a gastrointestinal protective agent are important in the management of pepsics. Patients should also avoid the use of nonsteroids antiinflammatories (except aspirin) as these will delay the healing of an existing ulser. Smoking will also", "### Answer: 50/52 Question: If an athlete presents with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, what should be the initial approach to management?Ingredients of the inhalation therapy should include a short-acting beta 2 adrenoceptor agonist as this will provide immediate relief and a long- acting beta2 agnoist (LABA) for regular use as prevention.I would prescribe your patient a reliever in the form of a \u201csalbutamol diskus\u201d (Ventolin discus) with a dose of 100mcg twice a day as needed, as opposed to a \"rescue inhater\" [Rialtix]- a combination of salbutemol and iprataprop bum\n\n e a (a sympathomimetic). Using ipraflozin the risk of potential tachycardia is lower compared to ipra  propium bromide and it has been shown to be equally safe and effective in exercise induced broncomoconiction. The combination with ipral o a confers a superior safety profile compared with other long acting bronchodilators such as formoterol. LABAs should not be used as monotherapy but in combination (in one inha ler device)with L ABCS or SAB As long as there is no concomitant use of (strong) I o i dc o, no contraindication for the use L of L ampul dry powder in patients with moderate to severe astma .I also would preferably choose the combination glycopyrronium/formoteroli (72 mcg/12 micrograms = 468 \u03bcg) rather than salbu ti molo 64 mgs over 3 in this phase-I study.

INH has recently been used increasingly in the management of cryptococcal meningitis. What are your thoughts on this method? Please describe. Question: 0,How do u treat a kidney infection? Prescription tablets, potions, or injections of antibiotics are used to treat kideny infection. These drugs are designed to kill or inhibit the growth of the bacteria or fungi causing the infection, and to reduce the symptoms of kidny infection such as fever, pain, vomiting, dysentery and skin rashes. It is important that antibiotic treatment is initiated as soon as possible, because delay may worsen the illness. The choice of specific antibacterial agent and the duration of treatment are influenced by a number of factors including the age, health status and symptoms (as some are for renal excretion and may accumulate in senile or diseased kidneys), nature of infection (e.g., urinary or parenchymal), the causative organism (different bacteria have different susceptibility to antibiatics; some types of bacteria may be more resistant to certain antibioitics), and potential for allergies (some nephrotic syndromes are associated with allergens and can be aggravated by allergicity induced by some antibotics). Question  1,What are my treatment options for a severe kidaney infection like Cystoisosporosis?The treatment of choice for cats with cystoinoisosposrosis is administration of sulfadiazine-trimethoprim for 4\u20136 weeks.Alternatives include use of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, alone or combined with prednisolone, 6-thioguanine (10\u201330 mg/kg/day orally) or 5-nitroimidazoles.The alternatives to use in case of allergIES are ivermectin or oral diethylcarbamazine citrate.Moxiflox", "### Answer: If the answer is \u2018yes\u2019 then there is no need to switch to a non-Penic-illlin drug.

(n = 110) 8,How long will the antibiotic take to clear the infection? What is the duration of therapy? Will a single course of antibacterial be sufficient or more than one course? Question  0,Why is levofloxacin sometimes given as a 2-day regimen instead of the usual 5-7 day course ? Is this a proper use of this drug that is usually used for resistant bacteria? How long after finishing the two day regimens another dose of Levofllxoacoin can we safely give ?

Can they be transmitted?What have studies shown about mutations resulting from fluoroquinolones therapy that led to development of acquired resistance?Is there any other factor in the background of patient like, family history of drug reactions, infections etc. that could have predisposed to this? Or is it a case of first acquisition of resistant strains then the reaction?Can this one strain in patient be represented in all the testing that was performed on this subject or there are different strands of bacteria resistsant to levoxfloaexacian? Was the original strain tested in PCR and Whole genome sequence was done if possible?

The binding of penelilane to bacterial enzye is tighter than the binding between cephalezine and the corresponding enyzme, resulting in a shorter half-life of the antibiotic . In the case described, the duration of drug administration was shorter than usual. Question  2,Should I take Benadryl to sleep? Or are antihistamines generally bad for sleep quality? I ask because it seems a very reasonable preventative measure and I have some very vivid vivid \u201challucinations\u201d upon waking up some nights. (I use that term loosely; I\u2019m not sure what the right term is). They seem to mostly occur when I am tired and perhaps have even dozed off a bit. I think they are just really vivid scenarios or plots that play out like a 3-D movie with a lot of special effects in my head. Sometimes I can control them, but sometimes they just run their course. It is so vivid that I sometimes get a start when in morning realizing it was all in just my mind. The vividness of them are a real kick in the behind sometimes. They\u2019re not bad necessarily, just challenging in certain ways. Would Benardyl quell all that? (And by extension, would the non-sedating antidepressants, e.g., citalopram, also quash all the hallucination-like scenarios?) I don\u2019t want to take a sedating anti histamineicn everyday, preferring to save them for night time when its necessary to get some sleep. That said, maybe I should get over it and just have the benadrryls ship in from the UK. :D Question3,How do steroids affect the skin?

It\u2019s use as a sign of \u201cfailure\u201d of treatment is however somewhat arbitrary and not univocally defined, as it implies an unsuccessful outcome, but may also reflect the natural history of the disease, the rate and extent of progression to heart failure and the need for re-intervention, which are all variable and often unknown parameters in any given patient. Moreover, recurrence of VT after an abiation procedure may have multiple causes, only some of which may depend on the operator\u2019 ability to ablate. I would therefore advice against the use of this parameter to grade operator competence.

One option is to try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. Another option would be to move your body. You could try a gentle walk or some Yoga. If you\u2019re feeling comfortable around others, you could also try socializing with people you trust. This can often help to reduce feelings of anxiety much faster than relaxation or exercise techniques. It\u2019s also helpful to make sure you get enough sleep each night. Finally, remember to breathe (slow and deep breaths)! This helps to activate your parasympathetic system and decrease stress hormones such cortisol . These techniques can help you feel calmer and more relaxed right away, as well as reduce stress and anxiety in the long run. Please keep in mind that it may take some time to notice changes if you are brand new to exercise and/or relaxation/meditation. Just like any other skill, it takes practice to learn how to relax and stay calm during stressful situations but the more you do it, especially meditation and progressive relaxation, The calmed and relaxed feeling will come to you with ease over time. I recommend meditation or listening to a Youtube video, while walking in nature, if possible. The sounds of nature can be very soothing and calming. Exercise is also a great way to calm anxiety and this article shows how exercise impacts anxiety . The two main reasons for the positive effect of exercise is that the mood elevates because of endorphins (endogenous opioids) released through exercise .", "What kind of complications can heart arrthymia cause?

It has a moderate efficacy and is tolerated by most patients, but it tends to cause weight gain and has other less favorable side effect profile compared to SSRIs. In general, Luox was found to be effective in about 70% of patients with SANS. Commonly used dosage ranges from 30 to 40 mg per day. At low doses (15 mg) LuvoX was not found effective. Despite this lower effficacy, clinicians may prefer this medication because of less severe side effects compared with other SSMRIshigh potency SARI (such as Sertraline) [90, 104].

So far, all oral PDE-5 inhibitors increase c GMP levels in blood vessels.

It is similar to other drugs in this group, such as sildanafil (Viagra), vardenafild (Levitra) and tadalafilda (Cialis).These drugs all work by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a chemical that is produced by endothelial cells in the penis and throughout the body.Nitric Oxide is released into the bloodstream and binds to receptors on the penile tissues causing smooth muscles in penish to relax and allowing adequate blood flow and filling of the corpus cavernosum leading up to erection..Numerous studies have shown that a low dose of falk flon nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) can significantly increase the amount of available nitic ox (NO) in muscle cells, and the increase in NO levels correlated well with improvement of muscle function..FDA has warned that consumption of \u2265 50 million international units (IU) per day of multivitamins containing niacin can cause Flushing, itching, rash, hives or Stevens-Johnson syndrome..

However, an overview of the age categories is informative (Fig. 9). In many children, autism is suspected soon after the parent becomes aware of development. For example, parents may notice by \u223c18 months that their child never seems to want to cuddle or be comforted, never wants to share objects or toys, has little eye contact, doesn't respond to facial expressions and gestures,", "Question: Are they the same? Please clarify. The mechanism of action described for maraviroc is incorrect. Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist. It works by blocking the CCL5 ligand from binding to theCCR5 receptor. This is different from what is described in the mechanism section. Question  What is amoxicillin and neomycin? \n ### Answer: Both amoxycillon and nenoicm are types of antibiotics. amp. Is the abbreviation of ampicilllin. Most of the time, the researchers use ammp. in place of Amoxy. I think the authors use nemonim as an example to show the effect of neomomycines on resistant bacteria. But it can also be used as a treatment for sensitive bacteria also. So, I prefer to use sensitive and resitant instead of using treated and untreated. My second argument is about the usage of non-standard abreviations. If the author used standard abrievations, it would be more clear even for the people who are not familiar with the antibotics (as in example, most of medicals student). If authors used common abbriefations such as AMP for amomycilin, then it will be easier to understand and there will not be any confusion between sensitive or resistanct as everyone know that Ampicilin (AMP) is sensitive to gram +ve bacilli and gram -ve cocci. In the end, if authors decide to keep these as Example: nenomyicn / amxifcion, they should explain what does NE means and what are the differences between NE and amxciflon. They should also add the mechanisms of resystance for nemsomcyin\n Resistance Mechanisms for nebramycin are mediated through two mechanisms : Enzymatic hydrolysis and Efflux. Hydrolytic inactivation by two plasmid-mediated neamine acetyltransferases (nat) and (nan), which acetyles nebamyeicin at the 6\u2032 position, is the most common mechanism conferring neboramyicu resistance in gram-negative baccili .

Question 5,What is the best treatment for otitis media with effusion (OME)?  ### answer: The treatment of OME is still a matter of debate. The main goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of developing chronic O ME and its complications. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for O M E with pressure equalizing tubes (PE tubs) insertion being the most common approach. Other treatment options include observation, ventilation, and surgical intervention. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of any of these treatment strategies over the others. Therefore, the choice of the treatment plan should be individualized based on various factors, such as the cause of ME, severity, presence of complicating factors and the patient\u2019s response to previous treatments. In general, non-surgical treatment has a success rate of 80% to 90%. If there no response, surgically inserting a PE tube into the mastoid cavity is usually effective. If the ME is caused by allergies, immunosuppression, or mastocytosis, anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, antihistamines, antibiotics, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene antagonists, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotica,l and/or hyper immuno globulin may be helpful. For patients with chronic ME who do not respond to conventional treatment, a trial of steroid sparing can be considered. This involves tapering off the steriods while monitoring the response. It is important to note that the use of long-term sterioids in children carries the risks of stunted growth, osteoporosis and increased risk for infections. Thus, it is recommended that sterods should only be used as a short- term measure to relieve", "Question: There is little or no information available on supports groups or even physiotherapists specifically for older adults with NPH.

However, the exact amounts and kinds of fruit and veg that people should eat to obtain these health benefits are still a matter of debate. The WHO recommends the consumption of a minimum of 480 g of fruits and/or vegetables per day, equivalent to five portions or 87 g each, with at least one of the portions being wholegrain cereals, whole grain roots or tubers, or fruits or raw vegetables.In this connection, one study published in Preventive Medicine and Epidemiological Methods  found that eating at more frequent intervals (though not necessarily healthy ones) was associated to a better quality of Life (QoL).

Question II 59 Question III 60 Question IV 81,Increased intracranial pressure in NPH may be due to blockage of cerebrospinal fluid pathways by excess water in the brain or excess solid tissue in narrow areas of the subarachnoid space. Excess fluid in brain is not a factor in increased intraneural pressure as described above. Increased solid brain tissue, from either normal aging or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can contribute to increased pressure. Also, in Alhteousr\u2019 s disease , the enlarged brain in children causes an increase in intrcranial pressures. Decreased cerebral blood flow may lead to death of brain cells [82\u2022]. There may then be a cascade of events leading to further reduction in cerebal bloodflow and more brain diease. This may also lead eventually to changes in characterteristics of CSF and brain, thus accounting for changes previously noted in 13,7,85.909115 In other words, there may initially be change in flow of CT, followed by subsequent change is its characteristics, accounting or the changes noted on CT scan. Thus, changes on a CT or MRI scan may represent initiation of a process that leads eventually death brain stem cells, account for reduction intheir number over time and thus loss of memory, etc . In patients with subdural hema, raised ICP may further stretch delicate brain tissues leading eventually decreased consciousness and possible death. It is important to lower IH in patients as quickly as possible to allow some recovery. Adequate nutritional support in acute phase leads to earlier recovery Intracerebal bleedings may create pressure on brain.

Bladder exercises. These can improve your bladde r control and strengthen the muscles that support your pelvic organs. You can do these exercises any time, any place. Ask your health care provider about Kegel exercises and consider purchasing a pelometric floor exerciser. This is a small, inexpensive device that you place under your bottom to help you perform Kevgel exercises in the correct way. Question 3.5,What can I do about my swollen legs? (F1,1)How can prevent swelling in legs (stockings, compression bandage, exercise)?Howcan I reduce the sweling inmy legs, ankles and feet if they are already swolen ( elevation of the legs; exercice; taking potassium preparations; wearing compression stockings or bandaging the limbs)Q2,5116619971E017052Swelling of legs and ancles due to oedema is the retention of fluid in tissues. It is frequent in women and causes unsightly ankle circumferences and often uncomfortable feelings of tightness or even heaviness. The question of whether compression hosiery helps or hinders this condition has been the subject of much debate in recent years. How can compression \"stocking\" help people who are not suffering from circulatory disturbances?In fact, the effectiveness of these measures has not been proven in adequately controlled studies.

Question: What is the difference between a major depressive episode and a recurrent major depressed episode? Can a person have a first episode of major Depression? Yes, a \u201cfirst episode\u201d is a term used when a patient presents with all the symptoms of a MDE for the first time. This is different from a \u2018recurrent\u2019 episode, which is when the patient has had at least one other episode in the past. Question 2,What is bipolar disorder and how is it treated? Bipolars are often treated with a combination of medication and therapy. The medication used is usually mood stabilizers, such as lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine. These medications are taken every day for long periods of time, sometimes for life. Therapy may include talking to a trained professional, either a psychiatrist or psychologist, on a regular basis. Other forms of therapy, including group therapy and family therapy may also be helpful. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary. It is important to work closely with the healthcare provider to develop the best treatment plan and to make sure the treatment is working. If the depression is severe, with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or if the person is unable to function in life, then hospitalisation is needed. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used in severe or long-term cases. ECT is not a treatment of choice for most people, but it can be life-saving in extreme cases of depression. 3,How is BPD different to BMI?BPD is characterized by extreme mood swings, from feeling very elated to feeling extremely depressed. BPI is an acronym for binge-purge type of behavior. A person with BP may have binges and/or purge.BMI is short for bulimia nervosa. Bulimic people usually have four common characteristics: (1) recurring binging and purging episodes, (2) loss of control during binger episodes and large amounts of food consumed, followed by a sense of guilt and disgust, feelings of loss control and often puking, fasting or exercising excessively to", "118,Should I see a doctor if I feel abnormal discharge?98 Question: I have been having pain in my abdomen and it feels like I might need to poop, but I don\u2019t see any reason why I should, I am not constipated, in fact I haven\u2019 t had the chance to take a full poo for weeks.

In the case presented, the patient was successfully weaneed of fluoxytine using low- dose lamtigine as the substitution drug.181 Question: 54,What drugs interact with Nitrofurantoin? Question 3.What are the side effects of long- term use?There have been reports of rare cases of cardiac dysrhythmia associated with nitrofulantion. It may also cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain, hypoproteinemia and allergic skin reactions. Nauseua and vomiing was the most commonly reported reactions in these studies. However, at the recommended doses most patients will experience no significant adverse effects. Question Question4.Nitrocysteine how it works?NitrOcystene is used in the treatment of acute attacks of cerebral vasospasm. Vasospasms are caused by the narrowing or spasm of blood vessels that restrict the flow of oxygenated blood to various parts of the body. During a vaso spastic episode, blood flows to other areas of brain to provide essential life- sustaining oxygen. This may cause other parts to become slightly swollen resulting in increased ICP. The purpose of using NitrOCystEine is to widen blood vessel so that blood can freely flow oxygen to brain cells.This medication is a combination of two molecules, a nitric oxide donor and a cystine protease inhibitor.As a NO donating compound, it is metabolized to release NO, which causes vasodilation resulting by direct smooth muscle cell relaxation and inhibition of platelet aggregationOzaydin, (2007)", "Question: 59.

Bile is a fluid that helps the digestion of fat in food. Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by different types of viruses, alcohol consumption, drugs and immune disorders. The most common symptom of hepatic inflammatory disease is jaundice, where the color of eyes and the mucous membranes of mouth and nose change to yellow due to the presence of excess bilirubin in body fluids (blood, urine or saliva). Heger-Sorensen, Inge R. \"Patient Education: How to Help Patients Understand Medical Information\" 13 2.10.2015 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/ PMC4500757/In 51,52, describe the consequences of jn, jv, rl.40, 41 Question: 3,How is HIV transffed from one person to another? \n ### Answer: [4,9,84\u201386] Question IV, HIV enters the human body through miosis of vagina, rectum or eye. It can enter the bloodstream through skin or other mousous organs. Question V, the most important route of HIV infection is sexual contact (including oral, anal or vaginal), blood and blood-containing body-fluids, such as plasma, semen and salvia. Other possible ways to get HIV are sharing injections with an infected person, receiving a transfusion of contaminated blood, or possibly through organ and bone marrow transplants. Unsafe inoculations with contated medical, dental, injection equipment or sharing items as toothbrushes, cups or razors can also spread HIV [38\u201342]. Question VI,Can HIV be transited by sharing a meal with someone infected with the virus?Eating food prepared by a person with HIV will not result in infection. However, sharing food among orans with utensils that have been used by an individual infected ositis may lead to transmission. Sharing food, like an orange juice", "### Answer: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be acute or chronic and can lead to liver failure, liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Most cases of acoustic hemihepatic hematoma are associated with underlying chronic liver disease. This could be a result of prolonged congestion of blood in the portal system that exceeds the capacity of liver's blood-processing ability. In the current case, the patient has preexisting alcoholic-induced liver inflammatory changes that potentially could have increased her susceptibility to develop hep cuff\u2019s bleeding when combined with the concomitant use of antithrombotic medications. Question and 25,Is there any treatment for hemicrania continua?3:The diagnosis of hemidiaptomization is not an easy task and many patients remain undiagnosed.There are no specific tests to diagnose hepidiaptomization and doctors have to rely on patient\u2019sa history of constant or increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli such as light, noise, smell etc. and a consistent record of chronic daily headache for at least three months, without showing any of your usual signs or symptoms of migraine or tension-type headaches, apart from constant pain, (this can also include carotid artery and other types of a head and neck pain).In addition, patients with a positive family history and past psychiatric illness are likely to be diagnosed as heming Way:It is difficult to differentiate between hemitriptan and the other triptans in terms of their efficacy and side effects, as there is no direct evidence comparing them.26,Acupuncture seems to have some positive results in managing henicrainia continnua but the level of evidence is very low, so more research is needed to suggest it as a routine practice in clinics.Seth: There are hardly any studies examining the effects of lifestyle interventions including diet and exercises in patients across the chronic head pain spectrum.The same goes for the use and effects and possible benefits of botulinum toxin injections in heminergic continui patients, and more studies are needed.Yildiz: It is impressive to see how some patients can benefit from just a partial removal of C1, C2 and/or C3 vertebra", "### Answer: Are the routes of transmission different for different types of hep C genotypes?Are Genotype 1 (G1) and Geno type 3 (GT3) transmissable through organ and blood transfusion?Can Hep C be transmmitted through sexual contact?Blood contamination through needle stick injury or hemodialysis?Cadavers? Can a mother infect her baby during pregnancy or childbirth?Through breast milk? Is there a possibility of having contracted hepar C and not knowing?Sexual contact, blood and organ transplantation, contaminated needles, shared toothbrush, dental procedures, tattooing, piercing, in prison, drug use/injection, illicit drugs, sexual conduct, reuse of contamiculated sexual toys, aerosol shesh, sharing razors, straight razor, barber, hairdresser AFAIK yes, GT1 is more prevalent in the western world due to inefficient sanitation and contimated blood products before the discovery of HCV in 2013.

Or is there a possibility that the itching and burning will persist and maybe even worsen? Question:: Also is this contagious? Can I pass it to my Partner? Could the Antifungal cream help with that too? (Inhibit growth/prev from being infected, or treat you both). Question = Does having athlete's foot elsewhere on my body increase the chance of having it onmy penis? Also, do I need to treat my shoes if I have it inbetween my toes? Should I use an antifongal spray or powder? Will this cure my athletes foot? Do I keep my toenails short? Does smoking cause athle'ts foot and should I therefore quit?Is athlets foot a sexually transmitted infection?Do I wear rubber gloves to protect my hands from the infection being transmissable?Will athlests foot go away by itself? Are there side effects of antisitamic treatment? What are the chances of re-infection after treatment with antfungals? Is there an anti-athletis foot vaccine?In summary, should we focus on prevention or on treatment as the most effective way in dealing with athletes foot amongst adults? Please provide evidence from existing literature on these questions. Question A and B Yes, there are many different types of treatments available, including anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants and corticosteroids. However, not all of them are effective in everyone. In addition, some people may wish to avoid the use of medication due to pregnancy, breastfeeding, other medications they may be taking, health issues or simple personal preference. As a result, information on non-pharmacological therapies which can be complimentary or alternative options seems pertinent and would help fill a gap in current research, as mentioned in 'Strengths and weaknesses of current study\u2019 below. It is also worth considering that lack of efficacy may lie with non", "A symptomb No, jock itch is caused by ringworm fungus that usually appears as patches of red, itching skin with fine white specks.

Question  55 ,Is bladder cancer very curable? \n ### Answer: No. The 4-year survival rate is about 70% if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. But if it\u2019s a late phase cancer, the 2-3 year survival is < 30%. Question: 60 ,What is an abscess? Why does it form in the body? How long can it last? What is the treatment? Question I have a boil on my calf that has been there for 10 days now and is starting to limit my movement. Should I see the doctors or try and express the pus out yourself and see what happens?The boils on your cuff are very difficult to express. Firstly they are in a sensitive area and secondly a lot of boiling puss will be produced which will cause a fever inside you and you will feel very ill.If it is infected it needs to be lanced and drained. If it ain\u2019t infected no doctors required.The people that suffer with these boilia are the people who don\u2019 t clean regularly. They keep it moist and warm inside by not drying out in shower and wearing poorly fitted, dampened cloths.Do you want to consult the doctor?Or do you think wearing long jeans is better than being ill?I would advise seeing a doctor if its infected or prescribe some good antibiotics.This is one of those diseases if not treated properly can end up in your blood.Then it becomes incurable and can cause death.Sometimes doctors give medicine so you have to pee a few times in 0 hours.Just to get you up and moving and your system works right you don't think about it.

If the patient complains of chest pain it must first be assessed whether this pain is caused by a cardiac problem or not. This can be done by taking the history and by any additional investigations that may have been done. Once this has been excluded then the problem is classified as \u2018non-cardiac chest Pain\u2019 (NCCP). Many other types of diagnoses can then be considered.

Is there any change?In the proposed BDP, does the excessive exercise subsume the activity in BPD? Do patients with BDF also engage in excessive exercice?Can the differential diagnosis between AN and BD be difficult and requires a high level of expertise? Can the experts be tripped up by the complicated semantics of eating disorder? Is this an issue for clinical work and not just research?A clinical vignette may be added here to illustrate the application of these concepts to cases we might encounter in practice. The weight loss and weight gain in AN may differ from the weight cycling in EDNOS and then from BP levels in binge eating. Are there specific features that help tease out these different cases? We might note here that AN is often less severe and less likely to be associated with a binging sub type than is EDNO/OSFED. Some patients might have the AN subthreshold ED, and for these patients, the clinical presentation might still be very similar to their sisters who were diagnosed as AN. Another tricky area is that patients who start out as one eating disaster might evolve into another as they get older. So, AN might progress into BPN, or BDN.

If these symptoms, particularly in a young or elderly person, are present one should seek immediate medical care, even if it is the weekend or holidays. Remember it never hurts to call your medical resource or clinic and ask if your symptoms are an emergency and how to proceed with getting care. We are here to help!

Hantaviruses are a type of virus that can cause hemorrhage fever and occasionally a more severe disease called h antigen hemolytic anemia (HAHA). This disease can lead to a fatal outcome if not treated properly. Question: Is hives a sign of anaphylaxis? PQP or CQ? Question Question  Is it possible to have a virus and then get hydroxychloroquine out of the blue? Has there been a sudden shortage? Does the virus disable the immune system? This sounds like a lot of malabsorption and bad digestion. These are the things that get missed because all the focus is on the respiratory system. I am not saying that the hydro will help but if it has not been prescribed because of bad side effects then that needs to be documented as a possibility not as an absolute. If someone is a non-responder to hydro what is the next step in treatment? Could it be a genetic variant in the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene that makes the liver break down the drug into the active metabolite? It has been found that people from African descent have this nonresponse to Hydro. That could be why in Africa there is high parasite prevalence; they are not getting immune suppression from the drugs. We need to find out what triggers this. 85,What is PON1 and what does it do? Is this the gene where they find the variant that determines what kind of acetylcholine your body makes is important to this story? These genetic variants (4) on page 14? How does this relate to the malaria parasites? Why do whites have the ACCh type for malarial illness (P.vivax) yet we see this disease prevalent in all ethnic groups in SE Asia? I think it might be interesting to see if there are genetic differences between those with the hypohromobrosis and mal de defer answer. Could those who are sickering have genetic variance that protects against developing the symptoms? Would that be something linked to reduced iron stores?82,Have any of your patients had toxoplasmosis related problems in pregnancy?

You make it sound so casual with your comments like: \"It is", "The hantaan virus (HTNV) is a rodent borne virus that belongs to the family Hantaviridae. The hantsavirus is fatal in humans and causes Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and sometimes results in death.50,51 Question: 2,3,What is the difference between hanticore and hantalyme? \n ### Answer: The HAnticore virus is not the same as the HTImyl\ne virus.The Hantic core virus causes HFRSS and the Hantalymyl virus\ncauses PUUV disease (non-fatal).The HTNV causes two conditions in human; one is acute kidney injury and another is hemorr o r rh age fever. While the Puumala virus usually causes a mild flu-like illness.It appears that either the re search ers had their facts wrong or they mixed up the names of the viruses in the process of writing their article. It is important to verify the correct naming of viral agents and their diseases and to double-check facts before finalizing a manuscript for publication.

{"Question": "Is there always an elevated temperature associated with appendicitis?", "Free_form_answer": "A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include Swelling in the abdomen Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Constipation or diarrhea Inability to pass gas Low fever Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.", "Must_have": ["Not every patient with appendicitis experiences an elevated temperature.", "The main symptom of appendicitis is abdominal pain, usually on the right side, which tends to get worse over time.", "Other potential symptoms can include swelling in the abdomen, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and the inability to pass gas."], "Nice_to_have": ["Appendicitis is caused by a blockage in the appendix which leads to increased pressure, blood flow issues, and inflammation.", "Untreated blockage may result in the appendix bursting and spreading infection into the abdomen, leading to a condition called peritonitis.", "However, these symptoms can vary and not everyone with appendicitis will display all of these symptoms."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: No, not always. The temperature may be normal, especially in early cases. As the disease progresses, the temperature usually rises to 37.8 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) or higher. If the appendix ruptures, fever may reach 40.6 \u00b0 C ( 1 05 \u00b0 F ) or more. Question: 8,Is there a way to tell if a breast lump is cancerous?9,What should I do if I find a lymph node in my armpit?1,How can I tell the difference between a benign and a malignant breast tumor?2,Should I have a mammogram to check for breast cancer if my breast symptoms are not specific for cancer?3,I have been told that I may have breast Cancer, what should be my next course of action? Question  9 ,Is thyroid cancer usually curable?Thyroid cancers are usually differentiated (well-defined borders between the tumour and the surrounding tissue), and most of them are curables. However, anaplastic thyroids (undifferentiated) are very rare but more aggressive and usually incurable.1.0 Question1 ,Can thyrostomy be cured?Yes, thyristomy can be curated. Thyristory is a surgical treatment for Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy. It is the only definitive treatment.2.5 Question2 ,Are there any side effects of thyrotomy?There are some risks associated thyriodectomy, such as bleeding, infection, damage to the parathyrods, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and hypoparathryroidism.3.7 Question3 ,What is thyromegaly?What do you mean by thyrome? Thymolipoma is an uncommon benigh tumors of the thymus.Thymic hyperplasia is usually associated to Grave\u2019s disease and may also be associated in other conditions such chronic lypromyositis, myasthenia gravis, thyme cancer and other tumours.4.9 Question4 ,How is Graved\u2019 disease treated?Graves' disease is treated with antithyrotropin antibodies (ATAs) and/or radioactive iod", "### Answer: No, temperature association ranges from 35.6 to 41.0 \u00b0C (96.1 to105 degrees Fahrenheit) with a median of 19.4 \u00b0F (11, 22). Is an infected appendix always painful? No. Pain may not be present in patients with acute cholecystitis or appendicideal ischaemia . Is elevation of temperature a sign of appendiceal rupture? Is ruqmented with haemorrhage or pus? Question: 0.99N/Apain is a symptoms of both gastritis and choligitis, so it doesn't mean that you have appendices problem. It can also be a symptom of pancreatic problems. 8.It happened that pain from my kidney area(left) was mistaken for appendicitus.

Other reported symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. Question  4,Can adults have mumps?  ###BlendID 7b,8c,9c9,How do adults get mumpstheymaygetitfromchildrenintheyworkwithMumps is generally considered to be acute infectious disease that typically occurs in children, but adults can also be infected. Mumps virus transmission is mainly through the respiratory droplets of infected persons. Adults are more likely to develop swollen glands in their cheeks, pneumonia and other complications than children. There is no specific treatment for mums. It is recommended to separate children and adults, especially when there is a high risk of infection in adults such as in hospital staff, to prevent spreading the disease to others.1,2 Question5,What is the average incubation period of mumph virus?The incipient period is typically between 12 and 34 days, with a median of 6 days1.What are the main symptoms of children with mumbs?Children with uncomplicated mumes usually exhibit a general paucity of symptoms and commonly present without fever, cough, or otitis media113195 Question6,Which of respitory tract infections is caused by a virus that cannot be prevented by an effective vaccine?1) Influenza2) Measles3) Rubella4) Mump75821It can be treated with Antibiotics which also effective for other infections like pus in ears and eyes.91014151718765.7 Question7,Why is measles so contagious?Measels is very contageous, it can spread through airborne particles ofthe virus in about 9-1- feet for as long as 8 hours46- 56849.3Why does measls cause diarrhea and voming?Very young children can suffer acutDiarrhoea and", "### Answer: No. When the temperature is below 36.5 \u00b0C, the possibility of early appendiceal necrosis increases.

Question: 68,What are the signs and symptoms of endocarditis, besides a new heart murmur? \n ### Answer: The other signs/symptoms are:\n- systemic embolism (myocordial infarction, splenic infarcation, cerebral infaration, peripheral limb ischemia) - arthralgia, malaise, fever, anoretic, weight loss, night sweats, hemolytic anemia.The signs & symptoms that we have discussed are general in nature & non-specific, any of these can happen in Endocartiditis.We also should include skin rash in signs, as mentioned in last case discussion.In order to diagnose Endo - carditis we also need imaging modalities like TTE & MRI of the heart. Also blood investigations like hemogram (anaemria in renal impairment), serum creatinine (renal impaired in diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension), ESR (high in inflammatory diseases), CRP (inflamatory conditions).High risk (congenital heart disease, prosthetic heart valves, intracardiac devices, recent infection or antibiotics).All patients with end-stage renothecular disease (RT Disease) on dialysis should be considered as at high risk.All hospitalized patients who developed fever and signs of infection in RT disease on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialyis should also be categorized as high-risk.Intermediate- risk(Diabetes melltus, hyerterstension, old age >40y, alcoholics, immune compromized).Low risk - patient without known risk factors for endo-carditis mentioned above.Most of patients (>90%) who develop endentral murmurs are in moderate to severe MS.Endocalitis can be preceded by tooth extraction procedure by 2 to 4 week.It seems that up to >50% of bacteremias, especially in hospitalised patients, are introduced from patient", "Please review this case report and answer the questions below. Question: 34,Is atherosclerosis always associatedwith high blood pressure and cholesterol? \n ### Answer: Atherogenesis is a multifaceted process influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. A common misconception is that it is driven solely by risk factors including high chlorolevels and blood presure. However, these are only part of the story. Recent research in the fields of molecular genetics and genomics has implicated numerous genes in athereogenisis(For more information refer to the Human Genome Etherium).As a result, it would be wrong to say that a high level of cholel and bloi pressure are required for aetherosclorosis to occour .In fact high levels of LDL cholarin are one of several known environmental precipitants for lesion formation .Hence I cannot support the statement \u201c\u2026 is always\u2026\u201d with that data.Although thse levels may be the most well known and important they are not absolutely necessary for the process of atereogenensis to occur.In my interpretation if the above study says anything it reflects a more complicated process than that described by the simple scheme of lipid deposition and inflammation, a scheme that I suspect is not capable of explanation for all of known observations.Atheroma, the clots that are the classic pathologic substrate of AMI, are certainly thrombi but of an unusual nature.

Are there differences in effectiveness or side effect profile between the  1st and 3rd generation antibiotics that have raised concern in other infection settings?Is the goal in treating uncomplicated UTD to fully cure the infection or to ameliorate symptoms and provide relief? If the former, what should clinicians tell their patients with uncomplexed UTS about likely course of illness and need to return for follow-up?What might influence the ability and willingness of an infected person to adhere to full dosing as prescribed?Should practitioners discourage the use of OTC HBTAs during UTF? Will this reduce the risk of development of resistance?If a patient with UTM has worsening symptoms or a high fever and returns for care within the timeframe of the usual duration in UTH from baseline, should the clinician repeat the urine test and culture? Or is the assumption that the patient will heal or improve or develop septicemia if this pathogen is circulating in the bloodstream and re-treatment should be based on a new UTP?How should practitioner communicate with patients about the probability of recurrence if UTT is their choice and how this compares to recurrences in those treated for symptomatic relief and possibly cured of their UTimperative care?Further research is also needed to assess the influence of a wide range of personal and social factors not addressed in this systematic review that may influence personal experiences with SUI treatment.

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

The mother then wonders why the \u201clittle one\u201d (as she calls her baby) is not gaining weight when drinking her milk.

Patients who retrospectively report \u201cproblems with ejakulation\u201d or \u201cfeeling of lost control of ejaction\u201d are significantly more frequent from patients without ED (25% vs. 93%) \u2013 but this is not to the same extent as patients that see a specialist for PD. In these men the prevalence of reported problems with peno-ejaculatory latencies and ED is 50% or higher . Question A man who is a smoker has a higher risk of having ED compared to a non-smoker Question Smoking of any length of time decreases the odds of achieving an ere-ction by 30%, and smoking more than 20 pack-years reduces the probability of adequate erectile function by a further 15%. So, the smoking habit may be regarded as a cause of erectic dysfunction; this would imply a causal relationship . These findings show that smoking has negative effects on erector-ileal vasculogenetic and neurogenetic processes, but whether this causes decreased overall erelct", "### Answer: Yes, if the medication is taken after the meal. However, it is recommended to avoid combining alcohol with medication to be on the safe side. Question: Are there any medications that can help with the burning? Pills for the sting or something? Maybe a cream? Question 2.How soon will I start to feel the effects of the flu medication? When do the changes to my vision occur? Is there a correlation? Questions 3 and 4 are asked at the initial assessment and then every 15 min thereafter.3,How are you feeling today?4,Do you feel different from how you felt before you started this treatment today?. These two questions are from the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) instrument. We asked these questions before and after treatment to determine if patients knew they had gotten sicker since arriving at our hospital.5,Can you tell if a patient has low blood pressure?6,Is there something in the ear?7,The patient looks really sick, what should I do?8,What are these lines on his back?2,Does the patient need to go to the hospital or can we treat him here?3 Question Question3.What about some drops to reduce the swelling? Or did you already try those and they didn't work?Do not suggest other treatments as this will delay getting to an answer. Redirect to discussion of risks and what to do next. This should be addressed earlier in consult since time may be an issue for full consult. Use of steroid injections for corneal edema should not be suggested since this may delay recovery and could cause fungal infection of cornea. Surgical treatment maybe necessary in some cases of infectious corpulmonale where antifungal agents have failed.(Table 7) [83\u2022, 91\u2022] Question4. So it's contagious then? Do people get it through contact or is it in airborne particles found in hospital air vents? [52\u2022\u2022], This research provides evidence that a certain type of protein [65\u2022\u2027\u25b362] can be used as a basis for a new class of drugs for pulmonary hypertension [16\u25ca] 53 . Question5. Okay and does acetaminophen do anything? Will it help?Know", "The answer is not definitely yes or no. There is a risk that the wine will interfere with the action of the medications. Some medications, such as antihistamines, can cause drowsiness, and drinking wine along with these medications can increase the risk of drowsy accidents. Question: Is there anything over the counter I can take for sinus pain/pressure? \n ### Answer: I usually take Sudafed, but when I travel I sometimes get a headache and need something else. Will any of these help?- Acetaminophen (500 mg)- Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (24 mg)\u2013Acetamedine (105 mg\u2013Pyrilamine (303 mg)(1 serving) Question : Whats in the oral kit?Its a kit for patients with impaired swallowing. It includes a tube and some powder. The patient chew the tablets and swallow them with water as liquids.The tube is 9 mm in diameter, so it is larger than a conventional straw and smaller than the end of a PVC pipe. We try to find a substitute for the tubes and so far we can not find. In the kit we include tubing with different thickness wall to facilitate the insertion in different diameter holes.A special dentist, which is also a physician, made the moulds. He made several molds with diferente diameters and the patient can choose which one he/she prefers.We tried to make a mold with a red color but the patients said that it was too alarming, thus we changed to the actual color.In general, the kits are valued in 53\u20ac and each patient could use the same kit until the death.However, we want to know if the product is acceptable and would help any patient with swallowING difficulties.Thank you for your time\u2026 Question 44,What can I take instead of SudAfed for pain? Question II 11,Is it possible to get something over-the-counter that would take care of both the pain and congestion?23,And would this help with my cough too?15,I\u2019m also having some trouble sleeping at night.

Question: What is Loxapine? -?is it addictive??how does it affect the brain?what is over the counter oxtetricyclcne\n? Question/ what is the class of insulin glucagon?\n\n\u2019Insulin\u2019 is a hormone, normally secreted by the pancreas, that helps cells take in gluceose, which is their basic source of energy. Insulin is often secret by pheocromocytoma and also by some non-functioning parenchymal tissue. \u2019Glucagoin\u2019 does not exist - the correct name is glukagon. It is usually secretd by specialized cells of the endocrine panceas , the alpha cells (19). These are located in a group of cells known as the islets of Langerhans. The purpose of glulagon secretion, an increase in blood glueose levels is to provide energy to the body and brain when levels have dropped too low. When the blood level of glycose is high, as in diabetes, insuline inhibits the secrettion of Glucagan. In humans, gluocagon is also manufactured from specialized endogenous cells in, the intestinal mucosa and L cells. Glucoagon stimulates glicogenysis (the production of liver glympa from the hepatic cells; Also glutta and glocose are produced in this process. Glypogenlysis is reversed in hepatocytes during gihorsisis and ATP hydrolys is formed) and therefore, increases the level g", "### Answer: The medicine NEO- OXY1 is used in the infected wounds of the body.

Yes, there is no need for a regular mouthwash in patients with oral lichen planus. However, alcohol-free, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic mouthwashes may be useful. Avoid astringent and detergents as they may worsen the inflammation.1 85 9 Question I have ulcers that do not heal easily, should have them check for something in particular? If there are difficulties in healing, the doctor may take a biopsy to check whether some pathologies are present in them that would require a specific treatment.(3 62 2) Question II (oral mucositis)In general, oral mocositas is accompanied by pain, this should alert the patients and doctor to the problems of a secondary affection such as infections, etc.Oral mccosias affects all layers of oral tissues.The clinical differential diagnosis of inflammas is often difficult and sometimes cannot be made. In fact, depending on the time elapsed since the application of ionizing radiation, an inflamed oral tissue can present different signs and symptoms, sometimes similar to those resulting from other oral diseases.Faced with the problem of painful masticatory dysfunction in a patient with a history of head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy, a clinician should proceed as follows:Firstly, one must rule out the causes other than the malignant one such cancer recurrence or a new cancer development, then one should search for predisposing factors for radiation mummy such an infection of mouth cavity by local inspection and if necessary, performing additional tests such DNA tests to confirm viral infection (e.g., ENT examination with swab for HPV test, or smear for fungi such candid", "### Answer: This product is used solely for urethral or vaginal applications prior to genital procedures such as dilatations, cystoscopy, vaginoscopy and endometrial biopsy. It is also used after surgery to prevent catheter blockage and/or infection in high-risk patients, such post hysterectomy and prophylaxis of pelvic adhesion development. Question: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is a type of magnetic field imagING used in medicine, chemistry and biology. The basic principle of NMR is that the magnetic moments of certain nuclei (mainly  protons) in a sample tissue align themselves in the direction of a strong magneticfield B0 and resonate (precession) at a certain frequency (exact frequency is dependent on strength of B 0 field and typeof the nucleus under consideration) when the sample is subjected to weak oscillating B1-field perpendicular to B-0. Because of the alignment in B -0 direction, the precessional frequencies of proton magnetic moment will be different depending on their environment (chemical constitution: chemical shift), such that each chemical constitution (or molecule) has its own signature (spectrum). Thus a spectrum of chemical constituents may be obtained and from which useful information on structure and concentration can be inferred. By analogy one can think of each molecules \u201cspin\u201d in aligning itself with the B \u2013 80 magnetic \u201cfield\u201d as the alignments of individual particles in an \u201corderly\u201d crystalline state in relation to the X-ray \u201cflash\u201d (incoming field). Similarly NESs are ordered structures (i.e. crystals) and \u201csee\u201d N \u2013 fields in much the same way and for much same reason as do chemical moleculesthe magnetic fields act as \u201cglues\u201d holding constituent parts of crystallo-graphic structures together, just as covalent bonding does within molecures; H-bonding and other weaker interactions serve to augment the structural order and rigidity of both mole- and nano-structures.

Thus, these questions are only suitable if the woman is in labor. To assess decreases in fet movements, ask the women on what basis she had assessments the decrease in movement, if any, and how she assesses decreaser in the movement. For instance, you can ask her how you had noticed the movements of fet during the current pregnancy compared with your previous pregnancies. You may also ask whether she has felt any decreations in movements in current pregancy and on which basis and at what time she feels this decrease i.e. whether any association with prgress in labour.You can also take history of the pattern of movements so as to have an idea of what to expect from her and therefore know how to manage her when she comes with complaints of decreetions in her fet's movements. The history should also help you know what form of monitoring to advice for her so that she can notice any changes from what is normal for hr. Also, the history will help in preparing her for emergency situation like pre-laceration of membranes, rupture of membranes and in setting up a plan of management for that case. Intervention such as amniotic fluid introduction and turning of a fetus, which may be in a transverse position, can at times be effective in increasing the fet\u2019 s movement .If a womn has presented with prolonged reduction in ft movements from a level that was normal fr her, her membrane should be ANTICIPATORILY tested for intact-ness.

They can also spread by contact with contaminated surfaces. It is possible to spread the virus starting 1 day before your symptoms begin through to 5 days after your symptom onset. 2,What are some ways to prevent the spread of cold viral infections? The best way to avoid getting a cold is to wash your hands often with soap and water. Other ways include avoiding close contact (including kissing and sharing utensils) with people who are sick, covering your mouth and nose with tissue when you cough or cough into your elbow if a tissue is not available, and disinfecting surfaces that you share with others. Question: 3,How can I tell if my child has a virual infection? Question 4,Can a common cold cause pneumonia?Yes, a bacterial infection can develop in the lungs (the lower airways) as a complication of a virus infection (of the upper airway). This is called a secondary bacterrial pnuemonia. The most important message is that antibiotics will not help and may cause severe side effects if used to treat a child with a \u201ccommon cold\u201d caused by a rhinovirus or other virus. Antibiotcs should only be used when there is evidence of bacteral involvement. This evidence may be present in children with severe disease, who may then have a higher risk of developing bacteraponeumonia. However, even in these children, antibiotic treatment should be guided by culture results. In children who have been prescribed antibacterial therapy, it should always be continued unless there are severe adverse effects. Withholding antibactierials when not indicated and avoiding unnecessary use is the best strategy to reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria.5,Is there a vaccine for rheumatic fever?There is no vaccine that can prevent rhesus disease.6,Will my throat swab test positive for streptococcus if I have rho throat?It is unlikely that a throat culture will grow strep if you have had a sore throat for less than 7 days.7,Why do I need to take antibotics for my sore mouth?Antibacterials are not effective against virues such as the one that causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (", "### Answer: Colds are spread mostly by viruses, and these little critters can take up residence in the nose and throat. There are several ways a cold virus can spread: \u00b7 Cough: When coughing, cold viral particles are released into the air and can infect the people immediately nearby. Ccoughing for a long time will tire your body and make you cough up phlegm, which could have trapped more virally particles to spread the illness even further. \u00b7 Sneeze: A sneeze is another way the cold-causing virals particles spread. They shoot out from the infected person\u2019s nose or mouth with a force of up to 100 miles per hour and could take their toll on anyone sitting or standing nearby especially in a confined space such as a class room or an office. The virus-laden particles can survive up 30 minutes in air or on surfaces and thus infect many people in an institution, especially during the winter when people tend to gather indoors for longer periods of time. Like with the cough, sneezing would also push the bodys\u2019 natural defence system out of balance and cause a fever if not managed properly. Question: 42,What damage does excessive hair growth cause??99,Do you mean hypertrichosis? What kind of hyper- growth are you talking about. I am asking because there are many forms of excess hair and many of them are not due to a single cause but a combination of genetic and environmental factors therefore is it really possible to link a DNA test to all of these forms? Question  57,Which doctor should I see if I want to get tested for hyperparathyroidism?65,If my doctor tested me correctly, then I should have normal calcium levels, but I have symptoms of high calciums. How is this possible?176,There is no way to detect a pituitary tumour with an mri scan?332256 Question. 60,Is dysphagia a disability?78,I have dysphasia and dysgraphia because of stuttering.

Most of the time, it spreads from person to person.13,37\u201340 Question: 0,How do I know if I got a worm? \n ### Answer: I had an abdominal ultrasound and I saw images that look like threads or thin wires. I was told that I have worms and that they are malignant. What should I do? Question1,What should the patient do after a bite by a venomous snake?Hemiburrus tessellatus is a harmless species of non-venom-secreting pit vipers which are widely distributed across Southeast Asia. Their bites may cause pain, swelling, and bleeding at the injured area. Generally, the treatment is to stopping activities and rest to control the swollen areas. Question2,Why did I lose my sense of smell?What do you mean by \u201cnormal scent?\u201d We all have different smells . . [0.4, 6.0] Question3 Question4.Can a baby survive SIDS if CPR is performed?Yes, if resuscitation is done according to current guidelines, babies may survive . However the outcome will mainly depend on whether the baby had a typical Sids or an atypical one. Atypical sids may show ECG abnormality, decreased BScan echo, increased initial lactate, prolonged the QT interval . It may also be associated with congenital anomalies . Thus the prognosis will depend upon the severity of these abnormalities. In some babies, a \u201cpause\u201d or delay in performing resusitation may have a disastrous effect. There may be only a few minutes of opportunity .It is always better to follow the guidelines and not get into any argument with those who do not. The bottom line is that CPA plus mechanical ventilation will save more babies than conventional C PR . Question5.What is atonal?At onset of labor the fetus is in the atonic state. This can be viewed by A-", "### Answer: The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses and is spread through the air via respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected people or via contaminated surfaces.Covering your mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, washing your hands with soap or disinfectant, and avoiding contact to the mouth with unwashed hands are some simple ways to prevent the spread of air-borne viral infections.Via direct transmission: through contact or aerosol particles from saliva or object with respitatory droplet of infected person to healthy personV: Respirator particles < 5 \u00b5m.R: <500 nmL: liquid aqueous mediaM: 20\u201370\u03bcm particlesC: cough, sneeze, talkV via contact54,43,15,65 C: Correlation CoefficientR Ratio between particulate class and total aereodynamic particles generatedM Mean particle sizeL Largest particle in aerodstatic size distributionV Variability coefficientQ Quartile Particle distributionQ5: particle diameter \u2264~10 \u03bcmedQ0: most probable particle dia 4 \u25ca, 8 31,Q1: P(dX \u2265 d) 90% - particle diamX = 0.5Q2: diameter values exceeding P (d 1 \u03b3) X are not observed, where the X factor is greater than 7Q3: the diameter is measured for \u03c4% of the total generated aeorodynamics particles, so that P \u221e (X) = (1 \u2013 \u00bc) \u00d7 \u00bd, Pmax(X)_max,PmaxX=\u221e=1.Q4: minimum difference observed between P\u221e and P3X (MP3/MP\u221e)30%, where MP\u221e is particle mass observed in air for a prolonged time and MP3 is mass measured after \u03b2 seconds.

Rabies is acquired through exposure", "There are several ways that cold viruses can spread, including: \n ### Answer: -By contact with infected droplets placed on a susceptible person in direct (by cough or sneeze) or indirect (via contaminated object or air) manner-By means of airborne particles suspended in the air for up to 30 min.-By contacts with contagious surfaces or objects.-Rare (2.5%) but possible infection during organ and bone marrow transplantation. Question: Can you survive meningitis? 64,Will I go deaf after meningeal infection?65,Is there any possibility of brain damage/coma in patients with meningoencephalitis ?66,What is the average life expectancy for a patient with late-stage meneningioma? Question Question  01,Can you tell I\u2019m lying?No, but I can tell when you\u2019re not being truthful with me. I will know when the story you told me doesn\u2019t match the images in my head. So, even if you try to lie, I might be able to tell. Lying is not something I want to do, so I would rather you not do it. If you do catch me lying, could you please tell me why it\u00b4s important you lie? Then I get to learn from this and you can help me understand the situation better. Thank you. A 2022 study published in Medical Hypotheses concluded that lying is a cultural habit rather than a character flaw. (11) Question:- Can a sinus infection travel to the brain?-Yes, it is possible for bacteria that cause a chronic sinuses infection to spread to other parts of the body, such as the bloodstream. This is called an intracranial extension. It can be serious and can cause brain abscesses. However, this is rare. More common is for the infection from the sinuse cavity to travel through the skull bones close to this casket and result in septic arthritis or osteomyelitis of facial bones, which includes the jaw.- Question- How do you know if a tooth is dying?\u2013You might have a dead tooth in your mouth right now, and it could be silently killing you\u2013But how?

The viral droplets can remain airborne and infect you if you inhale them while standing within about 6 ft of an ill person. So, stay away from people that are sick. What else can I do to avoid getting cold virus infections? Prevention starts with staying vibrant. Keep your immune system strong by eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep. In addition, there are several precautions you can take to help avoid catching a cold:1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, especially after coughing or coming in contact with surfaces that may be contaminated with the virus, such as door handles, shared keyboards, or drinking fountain water.2. Avoid sharing personal items like towels and tissues.3. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when cough, and cough or cough up mucus  into a disposable tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash immediately.4. If you have a cough that lingers, see your doctor, because you may have bacterial pneumonia or another lung infection, you could also ask about flu antibiotics.5.

Question 8,How serious is this condition called Paget\\'s disease? \n ### Answer: It is not a serious condition. Pseudohyperparathyroidism is the condition in which there is heightened parathormone secretion from chief cells of anterior lobe of pituitary leading to increased calcium serum levels. In contrast, malignant tumors of thyroid origin or other etiologies, cause rise in thyroxine levels, lowering thyrotropin levels and causing symptoms of hot and cold intolerance, weight loss as well as diarrhea and other complications.

NoYesMatch post -partnum depression PPD, post \u2013 partnum psychoses PPA, depression and psychses both are dis orders that can star t in post pa tumin Answer; YesNoNoYesThe article does mention a distinction between the disorders in their introduction where they state that \u201cMany mothers experience transient symptoms associated with baby\u2019s age; these do not fit the criteria for postnatal depression but are nevertheless a cause for concern\u201d and reference the EDPPND guidelines (which appear to be from England and Wales) which state \u201cthe criteria are intended to assist in identification of women who would benefit from further assessment and support.\u201d It seems that this distinction is being overlooked by both the authors and the reviewers. Yes this is an important distinction and I believe this should be made clear throughout the whole article. We have rephrased as follows:\u201d1,What are the differences between post natal depression (PND) and post partic um psychos", "Is dosages vary from patient to patient?If some patients are not getting relief from lower doses, then they should be up-titrated to higher dosures. Question: 46,What is Maximum strength of Carbidopa levels in human body?? \n ### Answer: It was found that there was a wide variation in the maximum steady-state plasma levels of carbidopea, with maximum levels ranging from 0.79 to 35.67 ng/ml (corresponding to a dosing range of 50-300 mg carbi/day div). On reviewing the available information it was deduced that maximum carbo-dopae in blood occurred after 6-9 hours of administration with a biological half life of approximately 9-14 hours. A literature review did not yield any information on the protein binding of carbido pa in humans, and this aspect was not considered in modeling. From the data gathered it is evident that car bidopaa does not easily penetrate the blood brain barrier. In this regards it may be relevant to consider possible variations in rates of transport. It is also relevant that the metabolism of exogenous car-bid opa has never been reported in man but this can still be considered by using values reported for the endogenously produced carb zipa in brain and in plasma. For car didopao the estimated rates for first pass metablism was set to zero, but can be incorporated in a future improved model. No significant adverse effects were observed car biasa that could not be ascribed to the concomitantly administered drugs, such as alcohol and antiemetic. Carb opp appears to be safe also in terms of cardiovascular (CV) effects. Plasma renin, PRA and aldosterone were not significantly affected by carboxipowa either in fasting or in feeding state. Accordingly no significant change in arterial BP, either systolic or de Dias, was noticed, even using high dosesc . In summary, carb didpa exerts its therapeutic effect without causing unwanted side effects, thus making it a favorable candidate for treating Parkinsonian and other diseases for which this drug could be useful. Its theragnostic potential, however, awaits further confirmation with respect to human use .

Question : 0 What does a urinary tract infection look like in adults?0.114.21E-161.00E+150Urine analysis and microscopy are useful in the diagnosis of UTI in children. In adults, urine examination and culture are usually performed to confirm the presence of infection and to determine the causative organism. The presenceof leukocytes, red blood cells, and bacteria in a urethral sample supports the clinical diagnosis. A urinalysis is not useful for diagnosing UTIs in patients with persistent urin Answer. Urine cultures are not usually helpful in acute UTRIs, as the bacteria are often not well established and may not grow in culture.In adults with UAIs who have not received antibiotic treatment, a high number of white bloodcells (WBCs) in urina sample is an indication of a UAI.The diagnosis is established by documenting >1,0 WBC/mm3 in clean-voided urines or >5 WPC in catheterized urino samples.Urease producing bacteria (e.g., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas ssp., and Klebsiella s.p.) can cause the formation of uroliths and should be considered in differential diagnosis in case of patients complaining of renal colic.A urrectal culture is positive in 12% of cases of prostatitis and in up to 20% cases associated with catastrophic complications.

This infection can lie dormant for many years, and decades later, it can reactivate and cause a disease called SPP. SSP is a progressive neurological disorder that causes damage to myelin and may result in disability and death. The risk of SSEP is greatest in children who had measls before the age of 9 and in situations when the mother was infected with Measles virus while pregnant with the child. So someone can get MeaSLs and SsePp can happen to them. Question: 0,How do you catch ringworm? \n ### Answer: You can catch threadworn by coming into contact with people or animals infected as well as contagious objects. 1, What are the symptoms of ring worm? It starts with a small red spot and develop into a rash with white pustules.2, Can ring worm be prevented? Yes, you can prevent it by practicing good personal hygiene, like washing your feet and toes and drying them thoroughly, especially in areas with high humidity. Be sure to wear clean socks and shoes, avoid sharing personal items like towels and wear bathing suits separately when swimming.3, Is the treatment of tinea pedis different for athletes\u2019 foot and ringwort?The treatment is the same for both athletes foot  and tineid mites .Over the counter antifungal creams or powders, such as clotrimazole or miconazol, can be used.These are generally effective if applied accurately to all areas of infection twice a day for 7 to 21 days.Alternative treatments include tablet-based antimycotic medications such 5-flucytosine or terbinafine hydrochloride, but these should be reserved for more severe or recurring infections.

Question: 19,Will tetanus shots help prevent measeles? \n ### Answer: It is not known whether tetrans shots provide any protection from measiles, but they do not provide immunity to the virus. However, tdap (adacel) is a combined vaccine against tertaes and measilus. 20,Can elderly people get measilis? Yes, they can. Elderly people may be more likely to develop complications from the disease. Measles is usually caused by exposure to cough or nasal droplets from an infected person. An elderly person may get it from a child or another adult who has it.21,Do health care workers need to get a special vaccine for Meatles?Health care work ers who work in the lab and handle Meantles specimens need specialized training and should get the vaccine at the same time. The vaccine protects them from infection if they are exposed while working. It also protect kids who come into contact with the specimen. In general, people should not be exposed unnecessarily to Means. That is why most research labs do their studies on inactivated Mea tes virus; they inactivate the viruses first so that researchers and the public are not exposed.8 Question 3,Why is there a shortage of Flonase?

Question 1,Is the Maternal and Newborn Health Programme only for the poor? No, the programme is for all pregnant women and newborns regardless of their socioeconomic status. However, a disproportionate number of poor women attend antenatal care and consequently, those with improved access are more likely to receive the services. It is important to note that in the last quarter of 2012 the government of Ghana introduced a fee-free maternal healthcare initiative to reduce materiandeliveries. As a result, it is projected that the introduction of this policy will improve matermal and neonatal healthcare for poor and rich individuals in both urban and rural populations. 51 Question2 What type of disease is whoopinfectious disease, prevent by vaccination and can be cured by antibioticsCough is a symptom of Whooping Cough, which is caused by Bordetella pertussis, an infectious bacterium. The pertactin-producing strains of B. Pertussisthe most virulent of them, are capable of spreading through the air from an infected person. This can happen even to people in crowded rooms or on public transport. Whoop cough can develop in every age group, but it most commonly seen in infants under the age of one year. Yes, whoosing cough is cusable by an antibiotic.

It was firstly described by the Austrian paediatrician Felix K. Stern (1884\u20131964, Figure 1(13- 28)), and, since then many studies have been performed. Most of these studies focused on the overproduction of blood vessels and its complications, such as the hypertrophy of some skeletal muscles. The clinical picture of KTS is well known and is characterized principally by capillary multiplication and lymphatic malformations [1, 7,8,14-17]. Known are also the cytological and molecular alterations that characterize the pathology . The pathogenesis is still enigmatic and there are only hypotheses. In the past this condition was termed \u201ccapillaro-lympho-angiomatotis\u201d  and \u201cvascular dysontogeny\u201d . Today we know that the molecular mechanism of TKS is more complicated and several genes are involved in its pathophysiology [21-23,3427&35]. However the real etiologies are still unidentified. Up to now it is not possible to establish a direct cause-effect relationship between the mutation of any specific gene and the onset of this clinical condition. Question: What is the inheritance pattern of kipkel-tranaunsjy syndrome? \n ### Answer: Is it maternally or paternially inherited? Is the transmission from parent to offspring? Or is it a sporadic condition? If it transmits from parents to their off springs, is KIPPEL- TRENAUNAY syndromes occur in each generation or in just one side of family? Question 9,Is the lupus nephritis serious? How does it affect the kidney? Can it be treated? LupN,This is good information for patients.

Therefore, males with this syndrome have two Xs and a Y chromsomse (47,XXY). Korsakov and colleagues first described Kinefelder syndrome in 1949. The symptoms of men with the condition vary: some have very mild symptoms and others have severe learning disabilities and social problems, often linked to heavy body movement and difficulties in social interactions. Several physical features are often present: long arms, thin, long legs, flat feet, hip and elbow joint problems and increased body hair. Many males (but not those with severe cognitive difficulties) also have small penis and testes. In some centers, it is claimed that the syndrome is associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer, especially in the family member with most severe fertility problems162,What do you mean by saying different subtypes of male infertility?: In the clinical setting, male subferticity is often divided into 4 different groups: those not having any apparent problems (other than a low count of sperm), those having abnormal sperms, those that have varicocele (a abnormality in lower the sack that supports the testicle that causes a varicose eczane) and those where some genetic test has found something not quite right4,Why is there so much variation in male fertilty problems worldwide?It is possible that some of this variation may be due to cultural differences in sexuall relationships and/or differences from places where people have come from In one study people reported that male factors involved in infertlility were influenced by occupation, education, psychic stress, and habits such as smoking, use of mobile telephones, drugs, analgesics and other health risks106. Is this really true and is this so for females also? Question 3 ,How do people get cancer?I think people need to understand the basics of cancer cause and how it develops within human body", "What are your recommendations for improvement of perioperative management for these children, considering anesthetic and surgical approaches to improve cosmesis and function? Question: 129,What is the life expectancy of someone with Marfan syndrome? \n ### Answer: The median life span in patients with MFS is 53 years in a study conducted at a single center in France . Mariano et al. noted that MFN1-related progeroid syndromes as well as aortic complications appear to be the limits to the lifespan in MHS . Early death is mainly related to a complication of atherosclerosis. In a series of 28 known Mfn1 mutations, those who suffered a premature death were homozygous for Arg350Trp mutation (n = 3), or compound heterozergouts for the same mutaion or other mutatiosns that affect the C-terminus part of fibrillin-1 (91) . Question 82,Is mastoiditis an ear infection? And if so, what is its etiology and pathogenesis? How is it treated, clinically and theoretically? What is prognosis and what are complicacies? (800Words) 70,87 Question Question III -83,The major cause of pareses and paralyses in poliomyelitis is degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Poliometry shows that the number of diseased neurones in one motor cortex is usually not more than 40.67 Therefore, the involvement of the anterior horns of spino-cerebral motoropath in motor paraparesis/paralysis is possible but not very likely. Paralytic syndRomes resulting from degenerative changes in upper motorneurones are usually irreversible, while the plegia in typical polio is more often than not complete and mirrored on both sides of body. This suggests that paralyzing lesion in case of polios is less likely to take origin in anterior spina horn but rather from anterior motor horn of brain or from pyramidal tracts in brain stem.", "Kipple-Trenauney- Syndrom (kist) is a congenital vascular disorder. It can result in skin cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue mass, with localizedOvergrowth of this segment is more marked in the lower limbs, and it always exceeds that of the skeletal apparatus.

I know it takes a while to get rid of the excess iron when you take supplements. Is that because the iron is stored in a certain organ for example the liver or is it transported around in haemoglobin? Question 10,How do I get my ferritin level up??Eat foods high in iron such as red meat, liver, beans, spinach. Take an iron pill (multivitamin with 55\u201365 mg elemental iron). Drink liquid iron supplement (containing only FeSO4). Avoid calcium supplementation as it inhibits iron absorption. Add 8 mg vitamin C to 400 mg Fe SO4 tablet and take 2\u20133 hours after.

The only treatment is to remove the excess Iron from the body. This can be done through the use of the medicine Chelator (Desferrioxamine) which is taken orally or through Blood Mobilization. Blood mobilization is done by extracting blood from either the arm or the vein that contains Iron.

The treatment is to remove the excess Iron from the body. This is usually done through repeat venipunctures if the individual is able to tolerate IVs. A clear goal of removing 100 mg of iron per week exists. Question: What can I do about the pain in my heel?1  ###Response: (Heel pain)The pain that is felt in the heals can be caused by different reasons. It can occur due to an injury or as a result of a biomechanical disorder. If pain persists for a period of two weeks or more, it is important to visit a podiatrist or physician to identify the underlying cause. Physical therapy and/or pain medication can offer relief in many cases. In some severe cases, surgery may be required. (Toe pain)(Hallux valgus)Humans are unique in that they walk on the tips of their toes. Since toe joints are flexible, they can correct the position of the foot as they come into contact with the floor. Concavity of our foot is an adaptation to walk in an upright position, but it also has a big drawback. As we age, we lose one third of this ability to correct our steps. Because our toes become longer, toe pain becomes increasingly more common. Toe muscles become weaker from lack of use and toe deformities can develop. Most common deformation is called hallux.Mild pain is often relieved by massage of affected toes and by wearing comfortable, properly fitted shoes with a wide and soft toe box that allows for natural movement of toes.(Hip pain: Osteoarthritis,Rheumatoid Arthrits,Oseodystrophy?)How can you distinguish between femorotibial and patellofemoral pain?The pathomechansim is different in each condition. For example in femoro-tibal joint involvement there is mechanic irritation of strenuous activities whereas patello-femoral involves more a degenerative process.Clinical picture is similar; pain around the hip, aggravated by activity, crepitans, restricted movement.Radiographic interpretation is very important. Misdiagnosis is common since X-ray picture of osteophytes may re", "### Answer: \u2013Iron is needed to makehemoglobin, which is a part of red blood Cell and carries oxygen to all parts of the body. \u2013The human body can only absorb a certain amount of iron at a time, so it is recommended not to take more than 400 mg ofiron per day.

Or can a same-sex person'scarcassine cause heterosexuals to become aroused? Do only intact bodies cause this? Can body parts do it? Are there chemicals or factors in semen or vaginal fluids that can cause such craving? Even animals in nature do not produce fluida vaginaL so the above scenario seems far-fetched.

{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.

Do I pass this on to my kids? My parents are divorced and I stay with mom. She has AS and she is always in pain. I feel sorry for her. Can I do anything to help her? I am only 9 years old. Is this all I will ever know about AS or is this just the beginning? Where can I find more information about this? Who can", "It is inherited in the autosomal recessive manner, so if both parents are heterozygous for the mutation and have renal tubular acidosis, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy that the child will have severe rachitic symptoms. The chance is higher for children of Middle Eastern, Indian, or Asian descent and lower for Caucasians.Inherited ricketSKORA, the most severe form of ricks, is an autossomial recesive disease. Most affected people have one common ancestor and share the same mutations in both alleles of the SQSTM1 gene. This is not the case for hypophosphatemic racketSKORS, which is transmitted as an X-linked recrcessive trait. Mutations are located on the X chromosome and manifested in males more severely than in females. SKORS shows extreme phenotypic variability, even within the affected families.Rachitis due to vitamin D deficiency is also inherited as a multifactorial disease, probably as the consequence of several SNPs with small effect located in different genes. These SNPS may interact with environmental factors and may lead to variable expressivity of disease phenotype.Heredited FGF23 rhomboedosis is caused by a mutationship of two variants: a rare, high risk \u201cfounder\u201d variant and a more common, low-risk variant. When the two combinations of varians are present in either the maternal or fetal compartment of a pregnant female or in her fetus, a severe phenoytpe is observed (homo FF:ff, heter Ff:FF, homo ff::FF).In contrast, if only one copy of high-frequency allele is present (FF:fF, F:Ff), the phenypype tends to be less severe (miscarriage, stillborn, skeletal changes)The vitro F binding affinity of F?2:Klotho increases according to the following order: FFFF (lowest), FffF?, FFiF? (intermediate), and FFFFF (highest), which reflects the severity of phenoptype for subjects with different genotypes Question: 128,What", "### Answer: The likelihood of passing on heritable ricketts to a child depends on the cause of the condition. If the rachitic phenotype is due to de novo mutations, then the affected individual has a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to the next generation. However, if the defect is caused by a recessive allele, only 25% of children of an affected person will exhibit the disease. Question: 17,What increases the chances of CMT? Two or more CNCCs or family history. 47.549,Will CCM1 mutate into cancer?CCM1 can give rise to malignant tumors.CCN2 protein is not associated with cancer.68.377 (Table 3). Question  61,Can keratosis pilaris be cured? Keratoses are composed of three keratinous layers stacked in layers. In hyperkeratotic lesions, it is a hyperplasia of all three layers, while in orthokeratopic, a thickening of only the basal layer is observed.12 Question : 73,Is kerning correct? Kering is commonly used in literature to refer corneal dystrophies.Kerning is incorrect. Corneas are covered by an epithelium, so what is designated by \u201ccornean dyskervar\u201d must be a superficial alteration or a dysisfunction\u201d Question Question18,How can cerebral palsy affect a baby? \u201cMotor difficulties\u201d as a result of brain damage that occurred in the prenatal, perinatal or postnantal periods.Mohammad, E. et al.2013What is cerebrovascular disease?A cereblual injury or disorder due either to arterial or venous obstruction to cere[br.-v. blood flow]\u201dThe most important complication of cereberal ischemic vascular diseases iserebrual infarction ...

These mutation are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An individual with a VDR gene mutction will have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each child. A mother\u2019s VDr gene Mutation will not affect the viability or health of the foetus but the child may manifest the disease phenotype depending on whether the infant has a second mutuated copy of Vdr gene whether by another mutution in that gene or by a single mutuation in combination with two wild type genes. Question: 40,What is hepatitis A? \n ### Answer: Hepatitis means inflammation of liver, the cause of hepatic inflammatory necrosis can be direct damage or toxins, most often a viral infection. Most patients exhibit no symptoms or have mild disease, but 0.5\u20131% of cases are chronic and may result in liver fibrosises, cirrhosis, and carcinoma.9The hepadnaviridae family has two genera: Orthohepad navirus, which includes the classical human liver viruses, (hepat A virus, hepit B virus) and the phylogenetically distinct orphan human he padnavirus (I. e. he patia virus).HepA virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. It causes acute he paticitis, usually in young children , and is mild asymptomatic form in adults. Foodborne illness is a common route of infection . The incubation period is 2 weeks (range 3 days\u201356 months). Hygiene and vaccination. 1st line) HG 8.41.

Question: 54,What is high blood sugar?2.75399.158106.272 Question 7,62,Is there a way to avoid the side effects of antidepressants?If so, what is it?Does it involve taking the medication over a long time?As with most things, if you take antihypertensives for your whole life you are likely to get side effect. If you only take them until you get your BP down, for example, then perhaps you won\u2019t get so many side experiments. It is also difficult to be sure but exercise and diet may prevent the onset of hypertension and therefore eliminate the need for antisocial activity forever. 16,2251.024.598297.6355.9 Question, 69,Does heroin go to the brain or to liver?3.803711Both79Heroin will go through the blood stream to all parts of the body but concentration will be higher in the liver. Heroin has many harmful effects on our body. But its effects are more prominent in liver cells as it is mainly metabolized in this organ . The metabolic process of herdin in human liver has been explained in Figure 2 . Inititally, heroni is transferred from blood into liver and cells by carrier mediated processes. Carrier mediates metformation may involve both carrier proteins and membrane transport organs such as the endoplasmic reticulum andmitochondria. After entrance into the cells, various opioids are metfom by different enzymes. In liver tissue, the major drug of abuse is herni, which is metformized to 3,4-diethynilheroin and morphine by an unique enzyzme herotoxit, a liver specific cytochromeP(450).

Question: 86,What is Hep C caused from? \n ### Answer: HCV is an RNA virus that causes hepatitis C. It is mainly spread by blood and blood-contaminated body fluids. HEV is also anRNA virusthat causeshepAThis is done by transfusion of blood or blood products,unsafe injection with contaminate sharp instruments,organ and bone transplantation,and from mother to baby during childbirth. The virus can also be caught through sexually intimate behavior, especially when there are skin sores or wounds in the genital area. An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby while pregnant or during delivery. In addition, sharing toothbrushes, razors, or other personal care items can spread the infection. Transmission via organ and/or blood transfects and infusion via contami-nate needle and injections is of particular risk in developing countries. (CDC, 2021a). Question Question  90,Hepatitis A virus How is it caught? How can you get rid of it? Infection is usually caused via the fecal-oral route, i.e., by the consumption of water and food conta-minated with the excreta of infected humans or animals. Most cases are foodborne . Person-to-person contact, via blood, body fluid, may also transmit the HAV. Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain may be present in symptomatic individuals. Symptoms last for a few weeks. There is no specific medicine for hep A, but most people recover without treatment. Skeleton and muscle aches are a common AFP, which may last 6 months or more before"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3307, "rouge1_r": 0.2399, "rouge1_f1": 0.2781, "rouge2_p": 0.044, "rouge2_r": 0.0319, "rouge2_f1": 0.037, "rougel_p": 0.1594, "rougel_r": 0.1156, "rougel_f1": 0.134, "bleurt": 0.2671, "bert_score_p": 0.7887, "bert_score_r": 0.8092, "bert_score_f1": 0.7988, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.4635}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4183, "rouge1_r": 0.3523, "rouge1_f1": 0.3825, "rouge2_p": 0.1, "rouge2_r": 0.0842, "rouge2_f1": 0.0914, "rougel_p": 0.2072, "rougel_r": 0.1745, "rougel_f1": 0.1894, "bleurt": 0.3254, "bert_score_p": 0.8014, "bert_score_r": 0.8455, "bert_score_f1": 0.8229, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.5136}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3187, "rouge1_r": 0.292, "rouge1_f1": 0.3048, "rouge2_p": 0.028, "rouge2_r": 0.0256, "rouge2_f1": 0.0268, "rougel_p": 0.1594, "rougel_r": 0.146, "rougel_f1": 0.1524, "bleurt": 0.2636, "bert_score_p": 0.7838, "bert_score_r": 0.8194, "bert_score_f1": 0.8012, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.4946}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3625, "rouge1_r": 0.2993, "rouge1_f1": 0.3279, "rouge2_p": 0.04, "rouge2_r": 0.033, "rouge2_f1": 0.0362, "rougel_p": 0.1952, "rougel_r": 0.1612, "rougel_f1": 0.1766, "bleurt": 0.3348, "bert_score_p": 0.7906, "bert_score_r": 0.8292, "bert_score_f1": 0.8095, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.49}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2869, "rouge1_r": 0.2315, "rouge1_f1": 0.2562, "rouge2_p": 0.036, "rouge2_r": 0.029, "rouge2_f1": 0.0321, "rougel_p": 0.1594, "rougel_r": 0.1286, "rougel_f1": 0.1423, "bleurt": 0.2463, "bert_score_p": 0.7745, "bert_score_r": 0.794, "bert_score_f1": 0.7841, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.4577}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.2669, "rouge1_r": 0.2062, "rouge1_f1": 0.2326, "rouge2_p": 0.016, "rouge2_r": 0.0123, "rouge2_f1": 0.0139, "rougel_p": 0.1434, "rougel_r": 0.1108, "rougel_f1": 0.125, "bleurt": 0.3177, "bert_score_p": 0.782, "bert_score_r": 0.8069, "bert_score_f1": 0.7943, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.4332}]}

It is often accompanied by fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety, headaches, joint stiffness, balance problems and brain fog. FM may affect 2-4% of the adult population, mostly adult women, but men and children can also be affected. The cause of FM is unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent further pain, fatigueme, depressione and improve function. Treatment involves a combination of medications, physical therapy and other non-pharmacologic therapies. There is currently no evidence indicating that one medication type is better than another for treating FM. In general, medications can ease symptoms, especially pain. Non-opioid analgesics, antidepressants and anti-seizure medications appear to benefit FM sufferers. Physical therapy including exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, acupuncture and biofeedback may also improve symptoms.

Some people with MIC exhibit only memory problems, whereas others have problems with language, executive functions, or visuospatial skills. The prevalence of MBI varies from 6 to 42% in the general population, depending on study design and criteria used to define MBD Many persons with Alzheimer\u2019s disease have changes in brain chemistry and structure that can be seen on MRI or CT scans. Alterations in cerebral blood flow, loss of brain tissue, and atrophy of specific brain structures, such as the hippocampus, are also detected. Biomarkers for Alzeheimers disease include amyloid and tau proteins. Amyloidosis in Alzetheimier neuritic plaques is shown on PET scan using a radioactive tracer 2-11C- labelled Pittsburgh compound B. A testerone scan measures regional brain metabolism that correlates with cognitive performance and decline. Genes, environment, aging, lifestyle factor, ApoE4 all play a factor in develpment of AD.

Many thanks gareth. Question  Do homozgyots for MG have any right to change their minds about being tested? Do MCPs have the ethical obligation to respect this and what can they do in situations when this happens? It happens often. Another issue is that patients are often not aware of the long-term consequences of testing. This must be explained to them as a separate aspect, in the initial counseling session as well as in every follow-up session. It is important to address this issue. A lot of patients have unrealistic hopes and expectations. They need to be made aware that a cure or a reliable treatment may not be available during their lifetime. Some patients may choose not to receive even life-saving interventions as long as they are able to take care of themselves and have a good quality of life. The MCC is faced with the challenge of ensuring understanding of these issues as fully as possible. At the same time, he/she must give space to the patient\u2019s individuality and respect his/her sovereign decision (also on requests for withdrawal of Life-Sustaining Treatment). There are no easy answers to many of those questions. What can be said for sure is having homzygosity for the M THFR C677T allele will increase the risk of some health problems, and may reduce the response to folic acid and B10. Therefore, it is good advice to avoid unnecessarily exposing oneself to sunlight and to adequately protect the skin when outside. Other measures include taking antioxidant vitamins A, C, E, beta carotene, glutathione and co-enzyme Q1 0, as these also help to reduce oxidative stress and improve the immune response.

Question( 35.24.1)Can the high serum calcium from hyperparathyroidism cause leptin resistance? 75360-8264Lepto MAG A high-serum Ca leads to impaired bone mineralization by three mechanisms. Firstly, high Ca levels inhibit the production of PTH which has a major role in bone resorption. Secondly high levels of Ca interfere with vit D metabolism. Thirdly Ca may directly affect bone turnover by a yet incompletely understood mechanism, perhaps in the osteocyte . High Ca and Pth levels may alter the leprin/adipo Q/Pth axis at multiple levels.

Are the kits/strips the for same amount, regardless of iodine intake? ie: a 7 day i intake  = 0;the same 6 day inttaeke =7;1week intdake =1; the next week intkake=0.5;then \u00bc etc so regardless if is lower or upper intakes, the tests strips would be the SAME intaketested in k1,k2,..k1o? the test kit would show similar detxication regardlessof i od amount consumed? so to \u201ckeep\u201d similar consumption \u201cdetox\u201d levels, intacetake the amount the kit test shows to been detoted to that amount? in otherwords, to keep blood levels low, keep consuming amount testkit shows? this is where it gets confusing when i see ppt show low levels & then high levels and then low again when sometimes you only consume the \u201cfree\u201d i you get from food, sometimes algae or supplements high or low.

It's been more than hundred years; we know a lot about varicose virus infection. However, there is still a long way to go towards controlling this virus as there are no proper drugs to treat and prevent it. Varicella zoster virus is the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has had chicken pox, the virus stays sleepy (or dormant) in the nerve of the spinal cord, or in nerves that lead to the rash. Later on, when the immune system (that fights off infections and cancer) weakens, it can no longer keep the varICella-zoster viRus (VZV) from causing shINGles.1There is no cure for shingules, but thereare medicines to lessen the symptoms and to prevent complications.

Question: 5,How many mg is gabapentin? \n ### Answer: Gabapentine is an anti-epileptic drug as well as an analgesic drug. One of its indications is the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, and the initial dose is usually 300 mg, three times a day. Its analgestic effect is equivalent to the traditional 40mg-24 hour release formulation of oxybutynin, but the incidence of drowsiness is less. 75-360mgs a week. Is this dose of gababentin an effective and safe dose for nephropathic pain with baseline creatinine >1.5?The authors cites a study which showed that gabapsentinea, an OTC drug, can safely be used in patients with renal impairment, however a safety and efficacy concern has been raised for this class of drugs.

Question: Fingolimod is a prodrug that is metabolized into a pharmacologically active compound that selectively inhibits the migration of lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) across blood brain barrier via sphingosine 3 receptor on lYM, thus inhibiting lM cells mediated immune response in CNS. It is approved for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Side effects include lowered heart rate and rebound rise in peripheral lI count which are transient and usually clinically insignificant. However there has been reports of serious consequences due to decreazed heart rates like acute cardiac failure, arrhythmias, syncope and even sudden death particularly in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. Although fingolimumd is considered a second-line DMT in MS after glatiramer acetate and interferon but due serious adverse events it is often reserved for patients intolerant of other therapies. Its use in post infectious headache is off label and lack effectiveness evidence from clinical trials but there are number of case reports which report its excellent response after other preventive measures have failed. Despite of all this patients should be evaluated properly who are candidates for this therapy to prevent any serious consequence especially those with concurrent cardiovascular diseases.

{"Question": "What are the chances that a person with CVID, who also has a thyroid tumor, will get cancer?", "Free_form_answer": "1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented. Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.", "Must_have": ["People with CVID have a greater chance of developing certain forms of cancer than the general population, including lymphoma and possibly stomach cancer.", "An individual with both CVID and a thyroid tumor faces risks associated with both conditions individually.", "The outlook for people with CVID depends on a variety of factors, including whether the individual has severe autoimmune disease, has sustained organ damage, or has recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage, or the development of cancer."], "Nice_to_have": ["The survival of male and female subjects with CVID is significantly reduced compared to the general population.", "For patients with CVID who also have one or more non-infectious complications, the risk of death is almost 11 times higher than for those who have infections only.", "Certain complications can lead to reduced survival in this group, including gastrointestinal disease, liver disease/hepatitis, lymphoma, chronic lung disease, and malabsorption.", "On the other hand, patients with an autoimmune condition, cancers other than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the development of bronchiectasis alone, did not have significantly reduced survival."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: 1.00 (1) Question: What is the life expectancy of a patient with aortic stenosis?

Question: What is the treatment for Cushing syndrome? \n ### Answer: Cushings treatment is based on patient\u2019s condition. It can be based either on suppressing the excessive cortisol secretion, reducing the size of the tumour, or both. The choice of method is mainly based of size and location of tumorous adrenal tissue and if it is possibly to remove it surgically. Most of patients (about 75%) are treated successfully. If surgery is not possible, other treatment options are considered.Radiotherapy has been used successfully in patients with inoperable Cushesings disease. This therapeutic option is still under investigation, because there are no properly conducted studies showing its effectiveness. Drug treatment may be used in patient if surgery and radiotherapy are contraindicated or as an adjuvant treatment after total resection of adenoma.There are a number of medical therapies that may help control corticosteroids levels in the blood. These include blocking adeno-corticotropin hormone (ACTH) or corticsosteroid production or using chemical compounds that will help reduce the effects of cortiCSteroid in body.

{"Question": "What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body?", "Free_form_answer": "Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.", "Must_have": ["The main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes.", "Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin.", "In type 2 diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin or cannot use it effectively.", "Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis and increases risk for type 2 diabetes.", "Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy.", "Long-term effects of high glucose levels in the blood can lead to serious health issues including heart disease, stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, and eye problems."], "Nice_to_have": ["Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose, derived from the food we eat, get efficiently used by our cells for energy.", "With the different types of diabetes, either the body doesn't make insulin (type 1), doesn't use it well enough (type 2), or experiences higher than normal blood glucose levels (prediabetes).", "In each type, the resultant high blood sugar levels can, over time, cause significant health complications if left unmanaged.", "Pregnant women are also at risk for a type of diabetes known as gestational diabetes, though it often resolves after pregnancy.", "Management and control of blood glucose levels are crucial to minimize the risk of long-term complications associated with all forms of diabetes."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: 1. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM): This is the most common type of Diabetes Mellitus. It is characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cells dysfunction.2. Insulin resistant: It refers to a condition where the cells are unable to respond to insulina.3. Hyperglycemia: This refers the condition of high blood glucose level.4. Pre-diabetic: An individual is considered to be pre- diabetic if he/she has a blood sugar level higher than normal but lower than the threshold of diagnosis of DM.5. Impaired fasting glueose (IFG): It occurs when the bloodglucoses level is higher but not enough to classify the person as diabetics.6.

There are three main types:Type 1 diabetes: is caused by the immuneSystem destroying the insulina cells in the pancreasThis type happens in children but can also affect adults. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): is the most common type. It happens when the beta cellsin thepancreatic islet either donot make enough insu lin or theinsulin that ismade is not used efficiently bythe bodyThe third type, is called gestational diabetes, which only affects pregnant women.It typically resolves after pregnancy but women who have had it have an increased risk of developing type \u2161 DM later in life. ADA \n ### Answer: What is insultin reistance?Insulin resistance (IR) is an underwater disease, characterised by a relative deficiency in insufficient receptors or resistance to insuitin on the cell surface, resulting in a decrease in cellular uptake of glucose and leading to hyperglycemia. Insulin receptor is located on cell membrane, and if the enzyme sodium\u2013potassium pump is inactivated, it will cause insulator not to work, glomeulus swelling and the inefficiency of insutin utilization by body. Hyperglycaemia caused in this way can be controlled by administrating insitutinous sul to reduce blood glocose level. IR is closely related to obesity, especially visceral fat. The increase of viscous fat in liver, heart and other tissues and organs will make the ability of mediating the effect of locally produced insoutine lower.

The strengths of this study include a large sample size and thorough evaluation of clinical data on 320 vititilgo patients with detailed demographic data, duration of disease, pattern of repigmen tation, and any prior treatments. However, the main limitation is the absence of a control group to assess the effectiveness of the treatment regimen used 7.

And I noticed it was getting better so I started using less. Now I think I need to take the drops as often as I can during the day because otherwise my eyes will feel dry and gritty\u201d (P04 0059). Question Question  90,Which eye has dryness?Or how many eyes have dry eyes?(P23 1165) Question Answer Yes. Dry eyes can occur in both eyes, but not necessarily at the same time.If both eye have symptoms of dry eayes, it can be a Sjogren\\'s syndrome or lacrimal gland failure.Punctum keratitis can cause dry, burning, redness, stringy mucus discharge and photophobia. Meibomian glands dysfunction is not related with dry-eyes symptoms but it is usually associated.Severe dry mouth (xerostomia) is caused, in majority of the cases, by Sino-Nasal-Spectral-Orbital (SNSO) syndrome.Xerophthalmia (dry eyes) and xerastomania (severe dry moth) can often occur together.SNP (sinerigus nasalis et pseudomonas), SNLL (sinusitis nasal et labyrinthitis), SNN (Sinusitis Naso-Ophthalmic) SNR ( Sinus Noscapto Rectal), ICNRII (incomplete nasolactimilal gadaenoid regurgitate in the right inner ear), CFSN(Chronic frontal sinus mialgia), RCSN (Recurrent idiopathic chronic sinuvascula neuropathy)Science, Technology, Health Education -\u201cHealth literacy: the world in 2025\u201d, p. 68, cited \u201c28.8% of Australians aged 45 to 74 years have a low"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4551, "rouge1_r": 0.2254, "rouge1_f1": 0.3015, "rouge2_p": 0.0968, "rouge2_r": 0.0478, "rouge2_f1": 0.064, "rougel_p": 0.1987, "rougel_r": 0.0984, "rougel_f1": 0.1316, "bleurt": 0.3298, "bert_score_p": 0.792, "bert_score_r": 0.8555, "bert_score_f1": 0.8225, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.3135}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4551, "rouge1_r": 0.2343, "rouge1_f1": 0.3094, "rouge2_p": 0.0839, "rouge2_r": 0.043, "rouge2_f1": 0.0569, "rougel_p": 0.2244, "rougel_r": 0.1155, "rougel_f1": 0.1525, "bleurt": 0.3032, "bert_score_p": 0.7955, "bert_score_r": 0.8619, "bert_score_f1": 0.8274, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.3142}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4038, "rouge1_r": 0.1721, "rouge1_f1": 0.2414, "rouge2_p": 0.0452, "rouge2_r": 0.0192, "rouge2_f1": 0.0269, "rougel_p": 0.1923, "rougel_r": 0.082, "rougel_f1": 0.1149, "bleurt": 0.2921, "bert_score_p": 0.7829, "bert_score_r": 0.8317, "bert_score_f1": 0.8065, "hallucination": 27.27272727272727, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.266}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4295, "rouge1_r": 0.1988, "rouge1_f1": 0.2718, "rouge2_p": 0.0903, "rouge2_r": 0.0417, "rouge2_f1": 0.057, "rougel_p": 0.2179, "rougel_r": 0.1009, "rougel_f1": 0.1379, "bleurt": 0.2964, "bert_score_p": 0.7897, "bert_score_r": 0.8449, "bert_score_f1": 0.8163, "hallucination": 18.181818181818183, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334, "fluency": 0.3182}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3333, "rouge1_r": 0.2097, "rouge1_f1": 0.2574, "rouge2_p": 0.0323, "rouge2_r": 0.0202, "rouge2_f1": 0.0249, "rougel_p": 0.1154, "rougel_r": 0.0726, "rougel_f1": 0.0891, "bleurt": 0.2383, "bert_score_p": 0.7634, "bert_score_r": 0.8352, "bert_score_f1": 0.7977, "hallucination": 18.181818181818183, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334, "fluency": 0.3241}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.2692, "rouge1_r": 0.1573, "rouge1_f1": 0.1986, "rouge2_p": 0.0258, "rouge2_r": 0.015, "rouge2_f1": 0.019, "rougel_p": 0.141, "rougel_r": 0.0824, "rougel_f1": 0.104, "bleurt": 0.2809, "bert_score_p": 0.7571, "bert_score_r": 0.8151, "bert_score_f1": 0.785, "hallucination": 45.45454545454545, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.3031}]}

Question51,the medication theyre on now has what kind of side effect profile? I would assume some of them have better side affect profiles compared to others as some seem to have more \"serious\" side affects than others (like the ones i mentioned before).

The effects on sexual functions are realized through the melanocortin \u03c1 receptors, while the effects in controlling the release of gonadotropins are mediated via melano crotin II receptor activity . Differences exist regarding the \ufb01nal inhibitory pathway on the secretion of LH in humans. It has been shown that the increased secretions of \u03b2-endorphin after exercise act on \u03b4 opioid re-ceptor, located on GnRH terminals, to inhibit the pulsatile secretations of both Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating horm\u043e\u043d\u0435 (FSH) [19\u201321]. Moreover, the increase in \u03b3 aminobutyric acid [GABA]ergic activity as a result of exercise is another path- way by which sexual hormones can influence sexual function in women.

The symptoms of a bladder infection and a perinephric abscess are similar, both including fever, chills, flank pain, lower back pain and urgent need to urinate. A kid infection may also cause pain with urination. If the infection is in the bloodstream, there may be no specific symptoms. Question 2,What is the best treatment for a urinary tract infection in a child?Antibiotics are the main treatment of UTIs. However, the choice of antibiotic depends on many factors, including the age of the child, whether it is a first infection or a recurrent infection, symptoms, presence of fever and whether the U Ti is community-acquired or healthcare-associated. In children with uncomplicated U Tis, oral antibioties such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or nitrofurantoin are usually recommended.

But 80% or more of these occur within the first 3 months (first trimester) of pregnancy. A misappropriated fetus (ectopic pregnancy) is not considered a spontaneous abortion. Before the third month of gestation, the fetal products are discharged with the menstrual flow, so in most cases, this is inconspicuous. In the second trennimal can have vaginal bleeding or sudden abdominal pain. The misalignment of the trophoblast (in the mole) leads to the development of an embryo unable to implant (as in an ectopic gravidute).

Question  32,What is causing my period to be irregular? \n ### Answer: There could be many reasons why your period is ir Regular. It couldbe due to hormonal irregularities, stress, change in diet or environment, medications, or other health problems. If your menstrual cycle is changing, it's important to talk to your doctor or a reproductive endocrinologist to see if there is an underlying cause and how it can be treated. However, if your cycle has always been ir regular and you're not using contraception, you could consider using a menstural calendar to keep track of your symptoms and what trigger them. This will help you predict when your next period will come and prepare you for the change. Don't be alarmed if you go a few months without bleeding \u2013 this is not abnormal. The most important thing is to figure out why you have ir regualirities and then adjust your management accordingly. Remember, just because you can' t get pregnant doesn' \u0442  mean you shouldn'\u0442  use birth control. There are many things women can do to prevent unplanned pregnancy if they are sexually active (this is no different from those who can get pregnancies), including but not limited to, abstinence, condoms, emergency contracon, \"morning after\" pills, IUDs, and hormone injections.

Question11,Is cerebral palsy caused by autism?", "Question: what are phantom smells? \n ### Answer: Some patients report smelling pleasant or unpleasant odors when no source can be identified. This may be related to changes in perception and/or concentration common with stress and depression. Question- The patient is not a child but a grown man. Please use adult language. The report is written at a 7th grade level, not suitable for a scholarly article but accessible to the general public. There are numerous grammatical and punctuation errors that make the report difficult to read and require time to decipher instead of focusing on the content. It is unclear why the authors included the genetic testing section under \u201cMethods\u201d as it does not describe how the testing was done nor does it provide information necessary for replication by other researchers. Since the patient\u2019s phenotype differs from classical OI, it is important for researchers to know whether the gene tests are informative. In addition, the table summarizing the family members, though including the correct information, is redundant and could be removed. Similarly, Figure 1 is confusing and should be replaced with a figure that helps researchers understand the phenotypic differences between this patient and classic Oi.Figure 2 is unnecessary and can possibly be deleted. Figure legends are too short and need to be expanded to aid researchers in interpreting the data. Most of the figures are very simple \u201cdot plots\u201d that can easily be created from the raw data using Excel or similar software. If the researchers feel that these figures were created with more sophisticated software, they should provide legended examples of how to make these \u201cgraphs\u201d. Lastly, Question(s): Please change \u201cOsteoarthirus\u201d to \u201cTMD\u201d in the text but leave \u2018OA\u2019 in \u2018PDB id\u2019 e.g. 5TJ1_A for Figure1.There are 3 Figures in your initial submission.

These should be applied to the infected area 1 to 2 times a day for 7 to14 days. It is important to use the medication as directed and to complete the full course of treatment. If the symptoms do not improve after 3 to7 days of OTC treatment, a prescription for a stronger medication shouldbe sought. Question  4,What is the best treatment for otitis media? Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections, but they are sometimes prescribed because the signs and symptoms of viruses and bacteria are similar. However, antibioties will not help treat a virus, and they will cause side effects. Therefore, it is best to reserve antibiotic treatment only for bacterial infections. Antimicrobial eardrops can also be prescribe by the doctor for mild cases of otits media. For cases with mild symptoms, the use of antimycotic drops is also recommended. In cases where there is fever, oral antipyretics can help to reduce the temperature. The use vitamin A, C, or glucocorticoids is not recommended for the treatment of ear infection. (Fig. 5) Question Question5,Is there a way to get tested for strep throat at home?Yes, there are home test kits available for Streptococcus infection that can detect the presence of the bacteria in the throat.These kts include a sampling device and a test tube that is sent to a laboratory for analysis.The results can usually be obtained within 8 to24 h, depending on the laboratory\u2019s processing time.It is recommended to follow the guidelines and instructions provided with the test kit to perform the testing properly.If the result is positive, treatment with antibacterial agents is required.Antibiograms should also guide the choice of antibactierial drugs.In cases requiring hospitalization, intravenous antibiosis is indicated.For outpatients, Oral antibitics may be indicated, according to clinical guidelines.6,Can streptoccocus cause other diseases?Streptcoccous is a", "What causes yeast infections?

Question: 82,What is the difference between fibromyalgia and CFS? \n ### Answer: Fibromyanalgia is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue and other symptoms such as depression, sleep disturbance, and cognitive abnormalities 42 while Cfs is associated with: fatique, post-exertional malaise, impaired cognitive abilities, pain and non-specific symptoms 53. Fukuda et al., proposed the case definition for CFT in 1994, which is still in use today 96. In 2003, a clinical case defined by Yunus and Sim Answer may not be optimal but remains the standard for diagnosing fibroymalgias 7376 (Table 3). Although the two diseases have many similarities, they are different in that fibomyalgialya have more specific muscle-related symptoms, while the CPT has more general symptoms.

It can also lead to chronic pain and interfere with daily activities. Question Question; 1,Does the bladder store urine? Or does it act like a reservoir that ensures a constant flow of ur urin? The authors should clearly define the function of the urbladar, because it appears that the mammalian bladders function as reservoirs. Storing ur makes the ureters (the kidneys' ur path out ofthe body) work to keep the pressure up in the kidney. Once the storage is finished in preparation for urination, the muscle relaxes and the stored energy forcing the liquid out. The flow is caused by the relaxation of a muscle. If this muscle does not relax, as in case of unresponsive detrusor, there is no flow, no miction. In these cases, if the reservior function is to store, then micturition will be achieved with maximum pressing effort (hypertension of blader) and when the amount stored meets the desired one(i.e., full blacharachia). In a healthy blatter, under normal circumstances, storage of 500ml is enough to ensure the flow. Therefore, in a normal function the storing part is not fully filled because the used storage space is already 25% or more under the maximum. This 75 % is for safety, like an emergency reserve in power stations.This means, when it reaches this level, even a small muscle relaxation will do,and flow out starts easily and in an accelerated condition, I mean with more force, initially.I want to ask about the physiology, how this storage and flow system works in normal condition and also in hypertrophy (overgrowth) of urothelium and during incontinence?Is complete emptying of the bladen possible, or does a residual water always remains?How can cystocald??\"s be treated (in the article it is said not to be well known what is the pathogenic mechanism of cnsttactial dysfunction, so", "Can sex cause trichomonas?

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: Trisomies are conditions in which there is an extra copy of a chromosome. Trigomy is a condition in in the which chromsome 19 is present in three copies instead of two. This condition is usually present at birth and is often associated with other chromsomal abnormalities.

Some cases have been found to be caused by a recessive (homozygous) mutation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone PLOD2 gene inherited from both parents.The chondrodysplasias that resemble achnondroplasia but have dominant transmission are caused either by dominant mutusions in Col2a1 or in chapersone ERp29 gene(same as in recesive short stature dwarfism) - see also Figure 4. Other chonrdrodplsias like KBG syndrome & SADDAN syndrome are transmitted as mendelian recassive diseases. Question  161,Is ASD a form of autism?a. Yes b.

Question: 8,Does metatarsalgia go away? Question 9,How long does it take for a fracture to heal?10,What is the best treatment for metatarasalgitus?The authors should discuss the treatment options available for this condition and the evidence behind them. They should also discuss prognosis and factors that influence it. The authors have not discussed the non-operative treatment available which is a major omission. There is no mention of conservative treatment in the abstract which does a disservice to the paper. I would like to see a discussion of the different treatment methods available and their merits. It would be helpful to patients if the authors produced a flow chart to guide patients into the most appropriate treatment based on the severity of their condition. This could be a separate figure to make it easier to read. We have been taught in orthopedics to consider surgery too early in fractures and this is not always in patients best interests. A good discussion on this would also be beneficial. As I said above, the fracturing of a bone is only one part of this problem. Once the bone has been fractured, there is often a cascade of events that can lead to further problems. These need to be discussed. For example, once the skin and soft tissue are damaged, this can affect the healing process. If the damage is severe, we can be left with a nonhealing wound and a large surgical site. How does metatomatosis affect this? Is it the same in all cases? The same should go for infection. Does the infection cause the metatses to act in a certain way? Or does the matatostosis cause vulnerability to infection? These are all important factors to discuss. Figure 1 is helpful but a diagram of all the factors involved would help the reader understand the process better.I would have liked to seen a more in depth discussion about the pathophysiology of how this fractURE presents. Why does this occur in certain people and not others? What is it about their bone that makes it more susceptible to this type of fractue?

Viral is treated usually with rest, fluids and pain relievers. They also have different treatments. The viruses that cause meningeal infections are usually not as serious as the bacteria.

Its physiological actions are vasodilation of renal arteries to maintain reabsorption of sodium by kidneys and regulating reactive oxygen metabolites. In kidney cells, it facilitates reuse of potassium and prevents loss of water and potasium through urine. Its major action is on the distal convoluted tubule in kidnes, but it also affects receptors in other organs like cardiovascular system, blood brain barrier, adrenal gland, liver. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of basal and renin angiotensin system RAS.

Common symptoms include a frequent and/or burning need to urinate, even if no urine comes out, a painful and perhaps itchy lower back pain, and pain in the pelvic area. Other symptoms can include cloudy ur, an unusual smell, some blood in ur and discomfort during sexual intercourse. If the UT is left untreated, it can spread to the kidneys and cause sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection. Question  2,What is the best treatment for a bacterial Uti??Antibiotics are the most effective treatment of UIs. The choice of antibiotic depends on several factors, including the patient's age, symptoms, specific bacteria causing the illness, how the bacteria are growing in vitro (in culture), and the antibiotica already used by the patients in previous prescriptions. In general, antibacterial agents are classified as either bactericidal or bacteriostatic. Bactericides kill bacteria, while bacterostatics inhibit bacterias growth. Most antibactrials used to treat Uis are bacteriaic. They work by disrupting essential metabolic processes or structures in bacteria. For example, ciprofloxacin and ofloxicin target bacteral DNA, tetracycline interferes with protein synthesis, erythromycin inhibits protein translation, clindamycin prevents cell division, chloramphenicol inhibites bacterotoxin production, rifampin inhibited RNA synthese, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole blocks dihydrofolate reductase, fusidic acid inhibite fungal Ribonucleic Acid polymerase and nitrofurantoin disrupts bacterials Nitroreductases. Antibacterials can also be classified according to their site of action. Some antibaterials act on cell walls (\u03b2-lactams,", "Question: 76,What is ace butalbutal? \n ### Answer: butylbutyl acetate is a cholinergic-non-selective muscle relaxant that acts as an esterase inhibitor. The butyloxy group is attached to the molecule, and it is responsible for the action\u2019s localization to post-synaptic neuromuscular junctions. Its site of action is similar to that of tubocurarine but with less muscle weakness and no significant respiratory depression. It is used in the treatment of conditions such as megaesian syndrome and myasthenia gravis . Question  92,Can I take Cymbalta instead of Wellbutrin??Cymbala is an antidepressant of the same class (SSRI) as Wellburrin.

Question\uff1a And does vitamin E help with AMD? ?  ### answer: Yes, vitamins E and C can slow the progression of AMD in people with the condition in one eye. These vitmains seem to slow down the conversion of the normal retinal pigment epithelium to abnormal. Both vitmin E  and vitmain C  can stop or slow AMD progress. However, a large study had to be undertaken to prove this, and it was with vit main supplementation in patients with existing macular degeneration. This was done in 2013 by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) research group. It found that a combination of vitumin E, C, beta-carotene, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, calcium, magnesium and other micronutrients delayed progress of intermediate AMD to advanced AMD by about 5 years . In relation to treatment of diabetic retinopathy, both Narednam et al. 70,and Tomany etalal. , 68 found an increased risk of vision threatening diabetetic progress, especially in those with poor blood sugar control.

Hyperoxygenation may cause oxidative stress to healthy cells and cell death leading to damage to cells in the body. On the other hand, mild hypoxia may trigger a cascade of protective mechanisms in cells. A balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide is required for life maintenance. Factors that lead to oxide\u2013antioxidant imbalance may initiate harmful effects to human body and induce severe illness state. This review will provide an overview of how changes in oxygen levels can affect human health with a special focus on ROS formation and its implications in medicine.

Question4 What are the differences between a cold and the flu?Colds are caused, in most cases, by a virus infecting your upper respiratory tract. The flu, on the other hand, is caused both by viral infection and, more severely, bacterial pneumonia. Colds cause relatively mild symptoms compared to flu. Symptoms of a flu might include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, chills, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain and coughing up blood [3, 87,88,110].

Question: 1, how long does a sinus infection last? \n ### Answer: The duration of acute sinusritis varies depending on the causative agent. Most bacterial causes will resolve with a course of antibiotics in 2 to 4 weeks. If there is a persistent, troublesome cough, which lasts more than 3 to4weeks, there may be a co-factor like allergy or asthma causing the ongoing symptoms. In these patients, treatment of the cofactor may also help resolve the sinusal symptoms in addition to the antibiotic therapy. However, chronic sinitis, often due to allergies or underlying aspirin intolerance, may take several months to resolve fully.

The treatment of Pro state cancer depends on the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. For early Prosate cancer the treatment options are radical pro statectomy or radiotherapy. Radical pro Statecto m is surgery to remove the pro sate g land along with the penis and some tissue from around the bladder and the urethra. Some men may also need their lymph nodes removed.Radiotherapy involves using high-energy X-rays to shrink the cancerous tissue and stop it from spreading. There are two types of radiotherapeutic treatment, external beam radiochemotherapy and brachytherapy.

This is known as hematogenous spread. Cancer cells can attach to blood cells or proteins in the circulation and travel to other organs, where they can grow and form new tumors. However, this is not the main mode of cancer metastasis. Most cancer cells metas-tasize locally, invade the adjacent tissue, and then spread to nearby lymph nodes or Organs within the same organ.Hematogen-ous SpreadRefers to the dissemination of tumor cells from a primary tumour via throm-bolic emboli or hema-totic implantation to a distant site within an organ-ised system, sometimes to an altogether different organ system.4.When do different cancers spread quickly?All can-cers do not spread rapidly. Some can get quite large before they start to spread, such as breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. Whereas, other can can rapidly and easily move to different parts of the body such Esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer, thus resulting in a poor prognosis.5.Should I be worried If I had a flat head as a baby?A flat (or \u201cflattened\u201d) head is a common problem in newborns. It is caused by the baby\u2019s head \u201cmolding\u201d to shape of its mother\u2019 s pelvis during the passage through the birth canal. In most cases, the head looks like it is flattended at the back.

(6.77, 42.52)13.11.29What is the best way to get treatment for nasral polybs?I am asking this because I have a lot of mucus and I am coughing constantly like a smoker. I do not smoke, but I smoke \u201csinus cigarettes.\u201d I suffer from rhinitis and sinusitis and my congestion has no cure.I have been informed that I may have nasallary polygs. They may be the cause of my cough and concurrent lung collapse.L1, I will try to reduce the size of your poly gs with some special techniques that you cough up your mukas and take a few deep breaths and cough again. L2, There is something in your respiratory system that is preventing you from inflating your lungs totally, so even if you are trying to do your best to cough, sometimes it will not work and the munkas just will be down there.You have two choices.

We are taught that we can lose up to 50% of our fingutips and still regrow them. However, if humans only have so many niple, you cannot grow what is not there. So noplacebo would make sense, the naptotem should be used to treat such conditions as with fingure tip regroowing.

If a part of the tooth is broken, it will not grow back. The tooth may be treated and the remaining part may continue to be healthy, but the lost part will never be repaired. It is important for children to have regular dental check-ups so that any tooth damage can be fixed as soon as possible. This will help to save the rest of tooth. 2 Question2 What is a dental abnormality?Dental abnormalities are any deviations from normal tooth development, eruption, morphology, or number. They can affect the appearance, function, and health of dentition. Dental anomalies can occur in the primary or permanent dentitions. Their causes are not fully understood but may involve genetic, environmental, racial, dietary, socioeconomic, infectious, hormonal, radiation, maternal factors, twin pregnancy, teratogenic agents, drugs, trauma, prematurity, elective tooth extraction, tooth transplantation, ectopic erupting teeth, congenital absence of teeth (hypodontia), and supernumerary teeth.

The patient can develop difficulty in breathing and swallowing. In some cases, the patient may even require a ventilator for support. Question: 36,What causes acne? \n ### Answer: Acne is mainly caused by the overgrowth of a type of bacteria, called Corynebacterium acnes. When this bacteria gets into your skin pores and multiply it would be combined with dead skin cells and sweat to form a pus-filled lesion which we know as acnez. However, there are some other factors that can also cause acNe on the skin such as hormones, diet, and stress. A certain level of hormone (androgen) is good for the body, however, an overproduction of it can results in acdz. Androgen binds to the sebaceous glands and stimulates the production of sebum which in turn causes the poers to enlarge. Sebum, sweat, bacteria and dead epithelial cells build up and form comedones. This was the stage one out of 4 stages and it is known as comedogenesis. Bacteria producing enzymes break down some of the sweat gland proteins and transform the oily character of comedone\u2019s contents into a thin non-pigmented film. Stage two is called inflammation and comedolysis (decompression). It takes place after the blockage of poer and extends from the guts of comedo into the deeper layers of skin. At this stage comedons are considered to be comedocysts. Flexible walls of this comeda are formed and the comcdo is enlarged. Struggle of keratinocytes and leukocyte to express a material like colloidal iron substance (ferricin), takes the name of iron-binding protein, it appears yellow and is visible with the naked eye. Hence the lesions change to dark yellow spots known commonly as \u201cblackheads\u201d. The blackhead is in fact not really black but dark red, or skin-coloured.

This results in the death of brain cells and the loss of certain brain functions. The most common cause of ischeamic stroke is a clogged artery. A bloodclot can form in a main arterty (thrombosis) or in one of the smaller arteies (embolism). Atherothromboic emboli are the most frequent cause (50% to 60%) of all ischaemic strookes. In this case, a thrombus forms in an artheriosclcerotic lesion in ar arty of one the main supra-aortic artesies and then travels to a smaller artery in brain as emebolus.

This concept is further developed in the next chapter. Question: 23,What is the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?  ###Choice: Answer 1aThe pathological feature of pul. fib from IPF is that it is caused by injuries of alveolar epithelial cells and the deposition of a massive amount of ECM substances, such as collagen which results in distortion of normal lung structure (hypoplasia and simplification of lung parenchyma), eventually leading to complete obliteration of airspaces.44 In addition, there is gathering of acellular colligenous material in subpleural regions, around the small blood vessels and bronchioles, and within the albuterol lumen as well. There is also abnormal depletion of elastic fiber in elastin, although its synthetic capacity does not seem to be different from normal subjects.This is a progressive disease that causes stiffness in a person\u2019s lungs, forcing them to scar by repeatedly healing injured lung tissue.35 Injury to lung cells releases subunits of collage, which then can bind with other proteins to form gel-like subproducts. The substance can thicken in small airways and around alvetoli to cause gas exchanges that are inefficient and lead to shortness of breath.101 , 0, Question 32,Is the only treatment for idop.

The term \u2018the Answer to No\u201d is used to describe the ECG abnormality that is seen during a cardiac event that leads to a TLOC. An important point to make is that synapse and trans-ient ischemic attack (TIA), although have similar presentations, have different definitions. TIA is a term used when there is an ephemeral or transitory episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain ischemia (with normal or near-normal blood pressure), from which the individual recovers within 20 min. Such an episode is distinct from an ictal episode, during which there are progressive changes in neurology, ultimately reaching a plateau, and the patient, thus, does not recover within this time frame of 10\u201329 min2 This distinction is crucial to the clinician because the management and prognosis, as well as the natural history, are different for these events I ischaemic stroke vs. hemorrhagic stroke?In stroke, the two major types are is chaemic and hemorhgic, which are subdivided into 4 main subgroups: thrombotic, embo li c, hemolytic/thrombolyticc,and sinus thoracic 7Is atherothrombo sis an autoimmune disease?The answer is \u201cYes\u201d19,24,If a large blood th ough ight is blocked in the brain, a stroke will occur.

I would also try online resources like https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-find-a-rheuma-tologist-412567 Question: 68,Is BPD a mental illness? Question 88 (in reply to 34): No, Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is not a \"mental illness\", but rather a personality (trait) disorder. Personality disorders are defined as \"an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates from the expectations of the individual's culture\". Because these disorders cause distress and impairment of personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, they are generally considered to be unwanted or unhealthy. However, not all individuals who exhibit these behaviors or patterns meet the criteria for a \u201cmentailnessl illness\u201d or personality disor-der, and there is significant overlap between BDP and traits found in the general population. Thus, the diagnosis of BPF0 in part depends on the context in which the behavior occurs. In particular, behavior may be perceived as maladaptive.I assume that you do not consider this statement (above) to resolve the problem. Is there anything I can do to help? In clinical settings, patients often lack information about their mental health problem, its typical symptoms and their effects on daily life. Hence, I consider it useful to provide them with general information.

They reported that indomethacin impairs penile blood flow and causes erectedile defects in men. After that, many animal and human studies have been conducted to investigate the mechanism of action of these drugs on sexual function. In animal studies, it has been shown that NSSA can reduce testosterone levels by inhibiting the activity of aromatase enzyme, which is responsible for the conversion of testesterone to estradiol. This reduction in testoterone can lead to decreased libido and erectic dysfuntion. Additionally, Nassa have also been found to have a direct relaxant effect on the penial vasculature, this can also leads to erecile disfunction.

Why does my body shake when I wake up from sleep paralysis? Do my muscles remain tense after waking up? Are my dreams an escape from anxiety if I am experiencing sleep-disordered breathing? Question 60,How do I fix my sagging eye? ?  ### answer: One patient explained that the droopy eyelid was fixed by surgery and that she had to undergo another operation because her eyeglasses were fitted to her before the first eyebrow surgery. Question61,Where can I get trazodone over the counter?? Trazodene is a prescription drug, so it is only available from a pharmacy with an appropriate prescription. The patient may have been wondering if the cost would be covered by the HSA, if she would get reimbursed from her flexible spending account, or if her insurance would cover the medication. It does not seem that any of those scenarios were clarified for the patient, and she may continue to worry that paying for it out of pocket would cause a lag of bills being paid and this is why she has a balance and is overdue. Additionally, the pharmacist should clarify those points with her and help her navigate her healthcare bills and any possible assistance that may be available to offset the costs. If this doesnot resolve, she should be referred to social work or a financial advisor to help with budgeting and prioritizing needs/expenses. We assume the concern is primarily the balance, but we must also address the fact that if a patient cannot afford necessary medications, they will be put in an even more difficult position when facing medical bills for care. This is where pharmaceutical assistance programs and pharmacies with patient assistance Programs can help. Referral to a clinic such as the one discussed in our case would also be beneficial.

Opiates may reduce T levels indirect:by decreasing production of dopamine, that in turn may affect T release into blood.On the other hand:methadone indirect effects on T are due mainly to blockade of synaptic reuptake of noradrenaline (NE) and dopaine (DA). The initial rise of T following methadene initiation is because of blocking of NE and DA reuprtake, resulting in enhanced release of these neurotransmitters from nerve terminals. This is followed by desensitization of the adrenergic and dysensinergia of DA2 receptors, and hence a decrease in T production.Bupropion, a relatively weak dopaminergic /adrenoergivae re-upta inhibitor causes only minor changes in testestosteronen levels.However, its metabolite, (thiodiazepine), which has weak additive inhibitory effects add on to T suppression caused by opiods", "What is the proposed mechanism? 8 Question: how does maraviroc work ? \n ### Answer: It is an entry inhibitor which works by blocking the binding of CCR5 chemokines to the CCl5 co-receptor.

It usually starts with a painful toe, often the fifth toe. But people do not seek medical help for several reasons. Some think it will go away on its own. Others have doubts about taking time off work. And those who have had it treated with toe pads or other remedies may be reluctant to see a podiatrist again.

The other less common defect is the single ventricle (0.8%), which is used as the end point for all complex heart disease.The other type of CHD is arrhyththmia, of which Long QT syndrome and Short QTS are common types; other types include BrS, Early repolarization syndrome, J wave syndrome.A: Tachycardia (fast heart beat), dizziness, fainting (hypothetical), heart failure, abnormal heartbeat, stroke.Q 14T1P13/15 Question 9,How is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease inherited? A: Autosomic dominant inheritance means that a mutation in a single gene is passed from parent to child. Both parents are heterozygous, but the disease is present only in children because the inheritence pattern is dominant. Question : 50,Should I be worried about passing my condition to my child?A. No, I do have symptoms and the symptoms won't get worse.B. I\u2019m not sure, my symptoms are variable and I have seizures too.C. The inheritince pattern in my family is recessive so my children might be ok.601. Adequate knowledge is not essential for parenting. That is why people become parents even though they do now know they are not fit enough to take care of kids (for example drug addicts, chronic mentally ill people). This is because these people may have traits that are inherited. 75,As a parent, you may be responsible for many years for the welfare of your child", "When is the likely time of onset of the problem?Are other medical conditions complicating the issue?

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression.

It is caused by a narrowing of the valves, which can restrict the flow of blood from the heart to the body. This can lead to heart val. dysfunction and even heart failure. Question: 69,What is arthritis of knee??Knee ar. (OA) is characterized by gradual degradation of articular cartilage, accompanied by subchondral bone remodeling and synovial inflammation. The progressive nature of OA leads to eventual narrow joint space, limited movement, deformity of joint structures, joint erosions, osteophytes, morning stiffness, crepitus, pain, locking joints, muscle weakness, limitation of movement and function, decreased physical ability, loss of independence, depression, anxiety, social isolation, reduced quality of life, disability, premature death. Osteoarthritic knees may be treated with total knee replacement surgery, in which the natural knee is replaced with an artificial joint. However, this treatment is not available to all patients due to its invasiveness and cost. Therefore, it is important to identify modifiable risk factors and develop effective interventions to prevent or delay the progression of arithrits of knees. 70,71 Question 80-82,How does a person get botulism?Botulium is present in all forms of soil, dust, sediment, water, air, food, animals, intestines of humans and animals. Botulimum type A, B, E, D, C1,and C2 are present as spores in soil and dust. Type A and B are the common causes of botuilism in humans. Ingestion (eating a contaminated food), inhalation (of spore or vegetative cells), and wound contamination (by sporing organisms) are three ways by which a human can get infected with botulinum. Foodborne botuliism occurs when a type of A or B botulentoxin-producing bacteria (B. botulus) contaminates food inadequately processed or mishandled. Infant botullimosis is usually caused when spored contamiated food is given to inf", "Question: a. Aortomic valve stnosis is the narrowing of the valvan opening in the aoretrum [S] b.

Arteriosclerosis refers to the thickening of artery walls through which the blood flows. 2.250583.990.006948217551307a. Valve regurgitation vs. stenson b,c. What are vascular resistance and compliance? Artery and vein have different functions in maintaining blood pressure and in regulating the flow of blood. Under normal conditions, the total resistance to blood in all the arteries of both the upper and lower parts of body is equivalent to R ary. However during exercise, R v r plus R exr contributes to increase the value of R t, causing the rise of BP . At the end of exercise the relaxed muscles contribute to vessel dia, which is accompanied by the decrement of P and R and hence the fall of T. In contrast to artherties, veins have no valves to regulate the back flow. So the B P fall is generally smooth due to continuous blood fi,w into t he heart through various vens. Hence, artereities and venies resistance must have a close relationship and must complement each other to maintain the harmony of circulatory system. Question  7.1.4,Table 8.How do vasculogenic edema and edematous skin differ? \n ### Answer: The authors mention edemetous (sic) skin and vasulogenetic edeme, both of which sound like edemas (which they are) but are called edems in Portuguese? Why not ede and -ese like all others? Vasculogeneic suggests a genetically (vascular) origin to skin edome, a rare occasion to have an -oma to go with the rest!

It is usually the result of bronchospasm or hypoxaemia. Common causes include asthma, pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, anxiety or depression. Very few patients have a cardiac cause for their shortened breath \u2013 at least not initially. Many patients suffer from hypotension or even shock at some point in the course of their disease. These patients are usually in need of fluid. Less often cardiopulmonase bypass is necessary. Question: 5,What is allergic rhinitis? Explain in simple terms. \n ### Answer: Allergic Rhiniti is an IgE-mediated inflammatory reaction of nasal mucosa to inhaled allergens . It can also be referred as hay fever which involves the eyes, the nose and the throat and caused by inhalation of pollens or other airborne particles, such as dust, dander and mold. Most patients may experience sneezing, runny nose, itching and swelling of nose (or decrease of smell) and throat, postnasal drainage, ear or sinusitis and, in some children, conjunctivitis or eczema. Moderate or severe disease may affect sleep, appetite, energy level, quality of life and may require immediate medical attention. The diagnostic approach to AR is based on clinical history, skin or Nasal allergy tests and I.g.e levels . Several classes of medications are effective in relieving symptoms of mild to moderate AR, but not as effective for severe cases. First line medications to relieve symptoms and prevent reactions include antihistamines, nasally delivered glucocortinoids, leukokrians and monadans. For patients not adequately treated by pharmacotherapy, desensitisation with allergoids or subcutaneous immunotherapy with whole allergins are indicated. In AR accompanied by more serious symptoms or caused disease control, immuno therapy is often", "69076.As indicated in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 and described in the legend, the authors show a correlation between % AS and age. They also show that a regression model including age, %AS, sex, BMI and atherosclerosis reveals that old age and % valve stenoosis are strong determinants of the rate of hemodynamic progression of AS. What does the correlation coefficient (0.3818) means? What level of valvular stenyosis is dangerous? Question: 74,How do you calm down when your heart is racing? \n ### Answer: There are a few techniques that you can try. One is to take slow, deep breaths. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body. Another technique is mindfulness meditation, where you focus on your breathing and bring your attention back to the present moment if your mind wanders. Question 65,Can an unhealthy diet cause skin problems?Yes, an Unhealth y diet can cause several skin issues. Acne vulgaris, atopic eczema, erythematous-like rashes, skin discoloration and premature aging may occur due to certain nutrients found in unHealthy foods.87 Question66,Could cholesteatoma be cancerous? No, choline is not a malignant tumor. However, mRNA sequencing suggests a common genesis with associated epidermolysis bullosa. It is classified ultrastructurally as a squamous epithelium or occasionally as an adnexal cyst.77 Yes, canine chondrosarcoma have the potential to transform into a higher-grade subtype, but this needs proof in humans. Some tumors may possess a more significant necrotic component, creating a suspicious mass. 56 Question71,Why didnt I get a fever for so long? This is the first patient I have seen with such a prolonged absence of fever despite evidence of a large physical insult to her body (necrosis). The patient did not appear to have any problems with innate immunity based on the absence (as far as the physician had reliable records) of infection, delayed hypersens", "AortIC stenoSIS is the narrowing of the heart\u2019s main artery, the a.oorticus (AO), which becomes increasingly restrictive and can result in severe shortness of breath and other symptoms. However, narrowed aroIC (AS) area can be present with little or no symptoms as more of a continuous process. Aortomic stensosis (aortmic stensoS (D), and arteriom stenson (C); D) are the other words for the same thing. Question: 5,How can I get rid of this cough? \n ### Answer: Please do not use antibiotics unless there is indication for respiratory failure, acute detrerial change on chest CT or sputum smear for tuberculosis. In fact, antibiotic could harm your lung if you have COPD. If the cough is due to chronic irritation, you might consider pulmonary rehabilitation or a trial of bronchodilator.6,What can help if I have trouble falling asleep due my COP? Try to create a relaxing environment, breathe slower and don\u2019t try to force it.7,Hypoxia is common in COP. Why did I not experience hypoxic symptoms such as fatigue?Hemoglobin concentration affects the perception of oxygen saturation. Lower haemglobin level and thus oxygenation level will not be associated with the classical picture of hypooxemia such fatigures, dyspnea, cheyne-stokes respiration, cyanosis etc.8,Is low blood sugar level a serious thing?You are your own protector.If you are not sure, check it again later, if it's bad then eat something, but don't panic (FG1-P2) Question Question 6.How do I fix my dry skin? Question? Creams and lotions are usually effective for skin condition like this. You should use them regularly, especially after a shower. Make sure your skin is slightly damp when you apply them. Don\u2019 t scrub the skin, just rub it gently. It is important to choose the right cream or lotion. The one that I use once cost me $100 for 15 tubes, so I asked my friend to send me some. I don \u2019", "Most patients with a steno\u00adsis are asymptomatic, even those with severe AS (defined as a valve area  less than 1 cm2, a peak pressure gradient \n ### Answer: (a) Is severe atherosclerosis seen mainly in patients who have been referred for angiography because of a symptom, or is it common in otherwise-asymptomactic patients? Question: 52 What are the common causes of chronic cough? 0 ### answer: The common cause of cough is theCommon cold (47.5%), Dust/Pollens (24.3%).34%Other (Enteritis, Infection of the upper respiratory tract, Asthma, Gastro-oesophageal reflux, Heart failure, ACE inhibitors, drugs)26.8%62.6%Chronic cough persists for more than eight weeks and may be caused by a variety of symptoms, including common cold, chronic sinusitis and allergies.

Question(What do the different stages in cancer mean? Please explain in as simple terms as possible, preferably without using technical terms.).? The cancer has stages to show how serious it is. The stage will show you how likely the cancer is to affect other parts of your body and how unlikely it to go away by itself. It will also tell you what the best treatment is and whether you are likely to need to have treatment to remove your womb. Stage 4 cancer means that cancer cells have spread to your bowel, liver, skin, or other organs. This happens in a small number of people. You are unlikely to be able to get treatment that will cure the disease, but you will be offered treatment or drugs to help you live longer and stay as healthy as you can. .You might decide not to continue with any further treatment . Some women cannot have the treatment needed because it might make the illness worse or cause another problem, such as an infection in their brain. There are often no alternatives. Some treatments may cause the wombl to swell or bleed and this might increase the risk of cancer coming back or spreading. If this happens, you may need a different type of treatment.If you have any of these symptoms: a lump in your stomach, persistent pain, a bloated feeling, loss of appetite, nausea", "20,What is the proper handling and storage of Glibenclamide? ?

This is quite important as it relates to the effect the drug has on people in real life situation. Question Question(5)How do you pronounce hydroxychloorothizzide\n ### Answer: what is a suitable brand name for hydroxizchlordiazde? (this is for one of the Qs) Question:-10 Question- Why do I get sleepy when a medication should make me feel alert? There may be multiple explanations for this question. First, many patients do not fully awaken following overnight rest. To accomplish a desired alertness, the medication must reach a brain concentration at a time when the brain is receptive to wakefulness. Second, medications acting in the central nervous system may interact with the patient's own physiology in unintended ways leaving the physician to explore trial and error methods to assist patients in their daily activities. In some instances, a physician may attempt to address a patient\u2019s complaint and simultaneously impact other aspects of care which may not have been anticipated. For example, treating severe depression may affect sleep patterns or causing hypersomnia. Depression and hypochondriasis may both be addressed in some patients. Attempting to treat the many facets of a single disease can be challenging due to time constraints and the lack of availability of certain medications", "Question: 4,How is thyroid cancer treated? \n ### Answer: Surgical removal of the thyroi\u00acd, followed by radioactive iodine therapy and lifelong thyromimetic medication are the cornerstones of treatment for differentiated thyri\u00acor cancer.Differentiated thy cancer is not considered very aggressive, but radioactivity i-odide therapy has a significant radiation component, and side effects from overexposure to radiation can result in decreased thyrot\u00acop function, hypothyroidism, or even thy\u00acroids\u00acmase in the long term. Question; 5,What is the best treatment option for achalasia? Myotomy, L recurrent nerve Ablation or Combined myotom\u00acyn L escherichia A blation?The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that combined mycotony with L recursent nerve ablation was better than either mytomy or Lap a blastoma to treat a chalazia. The differences between A chamotny A and mybotomy were not significant. As previous studies have shown, a combination of surgery and ablative procedure is recommended for treating a large number of patients with achar\u00acsia to achieve good long-term results. There are still some a patients suffering from recurrence after primary treatment, we look for\u00acward to seeing more R cT on this subject.The data from this study may be limited by the quality of original research. However, to the extent that we could measure, there was no statistically significant evidence of publication bias. Although we attempted to minimize the chance of bias by carefully selecting qualified studies, the possibility of some bias remains due to differences in study design and the nature of interventions. We will continue to explore the effectiveness of various treatment options for Achalasia and look forward to new evidence from well-designed clinical trials.Surgical treatment seems to have good results but with high recurrences rates, what is being done to reduce this serious problem?Answer: Question- 6,When should I be concerned about drowsy eyes?

Or can the binding of a ligand (of known concentration) to a transiently recombinant BBT1 expressed in a cell line be quantified (by saturation or competition experiments)? Question, Could it be that the results reflect differences in baseline characteristics between populations? E.g. are the ones from South Asia shorter? This could be a reason why they have a better result (in absolute values) the first week. Do you have baseline information on height? Please add all baseline data you Have (inclusive of those in additional tables) in supplementary material. I would also include a flowchart (the one from this study would do), Question; 70%,80%? What does it mean? Can you include some information about sensitivity of tests and power of statistics you used. Also, how did you choose this threshold? Where is this number coming from? Even though your study is not about detecting a difference but evaluating a harm, the same principles of power analysis and statistics apply. You should use the most conservative number (given the possibility of an underestimate in your original finding). You say that you looked at % change. What is your baseline? Have you considered evaluative study to have superiority of one treatment over other? Some comment on this would be good. Again, you are not looking for difference, but harm so even if your harm rate is low, if the non-harm rate in comparison is even lower, your % relative risk reduction may not be impressive but it might be very meaningful in terms of public health.
