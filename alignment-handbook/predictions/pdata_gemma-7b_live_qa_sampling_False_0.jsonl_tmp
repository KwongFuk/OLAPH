{"Question": "What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease?", "Free_form_answer": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis.

Once the product container has been opened, the sevoflurane will begin to evaporate and become less concentrated. The stability of sevoflurane once the container has been opened depends on several factors, including the temperature and humidity of the environment, as well as the length of time the container has been open. In general, sevoflurane is considered to be stable for up to 24 hours after the container has been opened, provided that it is stored in a cool, dry place.\n\nStep 2/2\nThe effectiveness of sevoflurane once the container has been opened also depends on several factors, including the concentration of the anesthetic and the length of time it has been open. In general, sevoflurane is considered to be effective for up to 24 hours after the container has been opened, provided that it is stored in a cool, dry place and the concentration is maintained. The toxicity of sevoflurane once the container has been opened is also dependent on several factors, including the concentration of the anesthetic and the length of time it has been open. In general, sevoflurane is considered to be safe for use in humans, with minimal side effects. However, it is important to note that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of sevoflurane can lead to toxicity, including respiratory depression and cardiovascular collapse.

{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma.

Such consanguinity is one of the numerous factors that could potentially contribute to the condition, and the individual risk is influenced by many factors including the specifics of the family's genetic makeup.Long-term pulmonary sequelae are possible, as untreated CDH can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, and potentially longer-term lung function abnormalities.

Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Answer:\n\nTrisomy 7 is a genetic condition that affects the body in a number of ways.

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression. Treatment will depend on how severe your stenosis is.

The aortic valve is the valve that controls the flow of blood from the heart to the body. The valve is made of three flaps, or leaflets, that open and close to allow blood to flow through.\n\nAortic stenosis is a common condition that affects about 1 in 100 people over the age of 65. It is more common in men than in women.\n\nAortic stenosis can be caused by a number of things, including:\n\n* Age-related changes in the valve\n* Calcium deposits on the valve\n* Infection of the valve\n* A congenital heart defect\n\nAortic stenosis can cause a number of symptoms, including:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fainting\n* Dizziness\n* Fatigue\n* Palpitations\n* Heart murmur\n\nAortic stenosis can be diagnosed with a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and an echocardiogram.\n\nTreatment for aortic stenosis depends on the severity of the condition. In some cases, no treatment is necessary. In other cases, medication may be prescribed to help control symptoms. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to replace the aortic valve.\n\nIf you are concerned about aortic stenosis, talk to your doctor.
