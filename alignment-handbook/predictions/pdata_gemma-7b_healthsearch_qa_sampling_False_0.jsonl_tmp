{"Question": "Are benign brain tumors serious?", "Free_form_answer": "A benign brain tumor, while not cancerous, can still pose significant health risks due to its location in the brain. Benign brain tumors grow slowly, do not spread or invade surrounding tissues, and often have clear boundaries. However, these tumors can cause serious complications depending on their size and location.

Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells.\n\n<h2>What are the long-term effects of a benign brain tumor?</h2>\n\nThe long-term effects of a benign brain tumor depend on the size and location of the tumor. Some people with benign brain tumors have no symptoms and do not need treatment.
