{"Question": "Alright so I dont know much about Lexapro would you tell me more about it?", "Free_form_answer": "Escitalopram, sold under the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, is an antidepressant of the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class. It is a medication for major depressive disorder and several types of anxiety disorders. It is considered an effective and well-tolerated antidepressant. The benefits of Lexapro for treating depression occur within a few weeks, but it can take about 1 to 2 months before you feel its full effects.\nLike other SSRIs, side effects include headache, nausea, sleepiness, ejaculation disorder, and insomnia.

Question - how often should you get a zoster vaccine? - 2019-02-27 15:45 - Answer - The CDC recommends that healthy people aged 50 years and older get vaccinated as soon as possible, and that people who are at higher risk, such as those aged over 60, people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and people of any age with chronic conditions should also get the vaccine. The vaccine is not recommended for people allergic to any component of the vaccines or to chicken proteins. People who have had a chicken egg allergy should be evaluated by an allergist before getting vaccination. Vaccination may be administered at any of these groups, but it should not be given at the same time as another vaccine, except for a vaccine for influenza. If a person has been vaccinate against varicella zosta, it\u2019s recommended to wait at least 3 months before being vaccinatied against herpes zostea. Zedas is approved for use in people \u226555 years of age, Zostavax is for persons aged >59 years, while Shingrix is indicated for individuals aged aged at \u226751 years.

Question: 6,How many mgs does it come in\n ### Answer: ???? Question; 7,What are the side effects of Zoloft? \n### Answer2.695.79E-110.0083196a138,933,Insomnia, fatigue, and drowsiness are common and usually mild. Hypersomnia has also been reported . Question 0,Does the venlafaxine come out of the body?a5612,73E \u2212 909.817a2846771,548This is unsupported by the literature and does not appear plausible. Venlfaixne is often detected in the urine  two days after administration, but not in detectable amounts in blood. This may be explained by its metabolism to O-desmethylvenlafkaixine, which then undergoes N-demethylation to N,O-didesmellfavirine , rather than the extensive reuptake and storage found with fluoxetine. Further, the detection of venlaXfaxn'e in urinalysis is likely to occur if patients have not properly complied with the medication. As dosing is once a day, it may complicate the use of this drug as a hangover cured if detected by workplace urinanalysis screening. For these reasons, we find it important to provide this information to both clinician and patient. If venalfaxein is detected, there are several other prescription medications which have similar structures that may provide relief as alternate drugs, such as fluvoxamine and levomilomiste. However, other trazodone based drugs like TC-5704 may also cause similar symptoms.

Please note that we did not specify the type of infectious disease in the title or text of the manuscript to minimize the risk of disclosure of patient information; We were not asking the patient to discontinue treatment after experiencing treatment failure. Question : what it means when you eat more than usual, but still lose weight? ### answer: Eating more food than normal but losing weight is known as \u2018hyperphagia\u2019. This could be caused by many reasons. One of them could possibly be stress-induced. Also, it could result due to medication that may increase appetite. A person could also experience hyperphagy due the association of several neuropsychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. Lastly, an uncommon cause of hyperappetite resulting in weight loss is cancer. Cancer associated hypermetabolism has been reported in several types of cancers including lung, pancreatic, skin cancer, lymphoma, leukemia and l mesothelioma.

It could mostly be observed in those patients with abusive nature and/or psychiatric comorbidities. Short term use should not be a problem in this respect. In case of addiction, switching to dexamphetamine with gradual dosage reduction is a option.Alternative: L-lysine, L -ornithine -aspartame (PLAL) or Lactium (Lactefine)Patients should avoid switching between products containing different salts of methadone (e.g., from Diversi-meth to a generic product) as dosages may be different. Patients may then risk opioid withdrawal. Question ### answer: Sublingual zolpidem has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of insomnia. Studies show that zopiclone and zaleplon, both approved for use in the UK, may actually be effective in treating symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest that raloxifene, a drug approved by FDF for osteoporosis, shows effectiveness in reducing the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women. This could have significant implications for the treatment and prevention of cancer as it may serve as an alternative to tamiflu treatment in a zoster reactivation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacology of rALXN-04 in zebrafish to see if the drug acts similar to z-drugs and if it exhibits anti-cancer activity. Our findings demonstrate potential antiinflammatory properties of a potential pharmaceutical drug which can be further investigated and developed towards treating different inflam-matiory conditions. Future studies can assess the teratogenic potential of RAL in animals considering the fact that Ral is prescribed to women of child-bearing age for preventing oesteoprotoriosis.

Question: 04,What is the recommended duration for oral iron supplementation before and during pregnancy? \n ### Answer: Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women. Even in developed countries, about 50% of women are anemic at childbearing age because of iron deficient diet and physiological needs of the fetus . Therefore, many pregnant females are advised to take oral Iron supplements before they get pregnant and remain on it until they deliver. This is to minimize iron depletion and prevent anemia in their unborn babies and postpartum periods. In resource-rich countries like United States, 32.5% and 21.3% iron-deficient anaemias are seen in prenatal and perinatal periods, respectively .

Most people come into contact with possible allergins through the respirable particles inhaled in air, so it is not surprising that some of these are allergn-causing. For example, people, especially children, can develop allerg rh, which can be caused not only by the hay and grass pollens, but also house dusts, molds, foods, and chemical subtances. In addition, some people can become allerg ic to drugs and medications.The possibility of allergie is never too late to consider, even if has been ruled out an individual from childhood. Sometimes allergs can even develop in adulthood. Is it hay fever or sinusitis that caused the problem, or was it an allerg reaction? Question2,How do you find out if someone has allergles?46.337.78Allergies can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the precise substance involved.

We ask that you to return the label showing the serial numbers of YOUR ITNS to the enumerator in sealed envelope. You will need to sleep underneath a suitable ITM/ITN each night throughout the study period for the intervention to work effectively.There is very strong evidence that ITNFs ( mosquito nets with insecticide ) can directly prevent malarial infection when slept under by humans. This has now been clearly established beyond any reasonable doubt.However ITNDs will only provide protection against mosqutoes which seek and feed at night, such as the anopheles species which propagate malaraa, while daytime biting mosquetss may still inflict painful bites but cannot transmit the disease. ITNEs, will of course, provide no protection at all against the many other species of mosketso which may bite humans during the day, but which do not transmit malARia.If all moskeitso could be stopped from bitenig humans, then malaa would cease to exist, for it needs the moskito to bite a human and then be blood fed.

{"Question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "Free_form_answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer.

Question ### answer: Vitil is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the pigment-producing cells in the skins. This results in well-defined areas of white patches. There is no cure for Vititgo, but there are several treatment options available that can help manage the condition. These include topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, and depigmenting agents. It is important for individuals with Vitligo to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan. Question Question4: how to treat a black eye? ###answer: The best way to heal a bruise is to apply ice to reduce swelling. Apply ice for 5 minutes, then take a break for the same amount of time. Repeat this process for at least 48 hours. Over the counter pain medication can also help. If the bruising is on your face, you may want to ice it for longer periods of up to 72 hours to help reduce the risk of discoloration. For black eyes, it is best to avoid heat treatments such as hot water or a heating pad. Resting and elevating the injured area can reduce pain and swollen. Avoiding strenuous activities for several days can prevent further damage to the blood vessels underneath the surface of the eye. Drinking water with ice can be helpful in reducing sweling. Aspirin can increase the effect of bruises. Wearing sunglasses can protect the eyes from further harm. The discomfort of a swelled eye should subside in 8 to14 days. However, if the swell is accompanied by a sharp pain or the pain does not subide, consult a doctor. (4) Question5: can a baby survive from SIDS?

Question : how long does it take for metformin to work? ? 2 ### answer: 4 weeks. 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Metformiin is a bigamist drug. It works through two mechanisms: (1) inhibition of complex I in the mitochondria, which leads to reduced energy production and (2) activation of AMPK, a kinase that regulates many cellular processes including inhibiting hepatic glucconeogenesis. The first action is evident within hours to a few days, whereas the second takes weeks to develop. So, the rapid effect is primarily the effect, but the slower effect also contributes. In any case, it is not a drug that is used to treat acute hyperglycemia, as it has no significant effect on blood glueose levels within 72 hours. Rather, metfromin\u2019s effect in reducing A1c is achieved over weeks and months of treatment. If the patient has renal insufficiency, then the onset of effect of metfomim may be delayed. Also, if the kidney function is severely impaired, glomerulonephritis, or diabetic nephropathy, such that the GFR is less than 50 ml/h, one should not use metforimin.

The drug comes in 10-mg and 40\u201360 mg capsules.The recommended doses are 20 or 64 mg daily. Higher dosages (up to 80mg) are prescribed by some doctors. Over time, the prescription may be reduced to a low dose (2.5\u20138 mg/day) or discontinued to prevent side effects as the acid levels in stomach normalize. Prerequisites for successful treatment with Priloran are the cessation of smoking and alcohol intake. Side effects include headache, abdominal pain, n jaundice, pneumonia, and bloodstream infection. There have also been case reports of hypo pigmentation at the site of constant sun exposure (such as face, forearms, hands, etc.) as well as skin redness and itchiness after discharge from Prloran.

MedHighMed Question1,What happens when dementia starts? The memory impairment usually starts with episodic memory, that is, the ability to remember the details of recent events. As de la Iglda & Bl\u00e1zquez (2014) note, such impaired memory happens in a large part of those aged 70 years or older, and it could also be a result of vascular origin (Takeda, Umeda et al., 2,007). Furthermore, a decline in this capacity leads to difficulties in recalling the last things that have been done or said. Thus, people with de facto memory loss might not remember having performed some actions or the conversations they have had just a few minutes before (Hugo & Pettigrew,1996).

This could be due to a variety of reasons, one of which is Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

If the shaking is not very pronounced and you do not have a fever you may have experienced a small stroke (cerebral infarction). As mentioned earlier, you should visit a medical facility the next day. The treatment would then depend on what type of stroke you had.

There are also a number of homeopathic and other remedies supposedly helpful in speeding up healing, although there is little scientific evidence in support of these. Be prepared for odd looks for a few days or a week or two. It really is not a big deal.15,100 Black eyes are caused by trauma (usually blunt force) to the area around the orbit, causing bruising of the thin layer of tissue beneath the skin. Often the trauma is severe enough that the victim also experiences a transitory loss of consciousness (the so-called \"stunned\" condition).32 The trauma may also result in a concussion (brain injuries) and/or facial fractures (most commonly, breaks in the nostril).125 Question 3,I have swollen glands in my neck, what could it be?  \n #### Answer is your question, I have to add that we can not tell you for sure what kind of sickness you have, we could give you some explanations and we really wish you to go to doctor and get proper medicine.

If you have any related questions, feel free to ask. (P.S. I am looking forward to your questions and problems, any time.) Question: Anything for pain relief?\n? Please advise.\n\n### Answer32% of patients received a code for hydromorphone (5 mg or 10 mg) administered by nursing staff for moderate to severe pain. Of these, 77% had no baseline pain while 23% reported some baseline level of pain (Table 3). The majority of these patients were satisfied with the analgesic effect (82%) and reported a reduction in pain intensity after administration of hydormorphpane. Question : Are opioids a safe medication to take when pregnant? Commonly used opiates in the treatment of postpartum pain include oxycodone, hydrocodem, morphine, and fentanyl. Methadone and bupropion can also be used. Physiological changes that occur during pregnancy may affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmocokinetics of opiate medications, resulting in increased transit time of the drug and prolonged half-life. This is due to decreased hepatic metabolism and reduced renal excretion of drug metabolic by-products during gestation . Therefore, lower doses of many opiuates are often required to achieve a similar level therapeutic efficacy. The primary concern regarding the safety of ongoing opiod use in pregnant individuals is the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which consists of a group of symptoms including gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, behavioural and precipitate withdrawal symptoms that can develop in newborns suddenly deprived of, or exposed to, the opios. Withdrawal symptoms can begin as soon as 48 h after birth and can last for weeks. Diagnosis of NAS requires a high degree of suspicion by the physician, as the symptoms are difficult to distinguish from those caused by other conditions . To mitigate the severity of this problem, physicians should work with mothers to wean", "3.Anything I should avoid doing for a period of time (before or after surgery)? What can I do?

{"Question": "Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ?", "Free_form_answer": "Lutein is a carotenoid compound which is available in green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, and peas), along with other foods, such as eggs, pistachios, and corn. Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, which is the light sensitive area of the eye. Studies have attributed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects to lutein. The studies suggest that lutein may protect against and reduce the severity of many eye diseases. By reducing damage to the retina, lutein may enhance vision in both normal and diseased eyes.\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is also found in the retina. DHA is involved in the process of transforming light to a neurological signal and generating light sensitive pigment. Studies on the effects of DHA (omega 3) found mixed results on improvement of vision, but no studies showed a negative effect.

In other words, how long should you try to file or cut the ingrowth before giving up and seeking treatment? This is an important question because it has direct bearing on when you should seek professional help. If you wait too long, the condition may worsen to the point where it no longer can be treated at home. On the other hand, if you seek help too early, you will have to wait for your appointment and you may be left with the impression that the treatment takes a long time, when in fact the active treatment phase only lasts for 6 to 9 months. The answer to this question is highly dependent on the type of ingrrownail you have and how late you are seeking help after the onset of symptoms. In general, however, most ingrowned nails can safely be cut short by the patients themselves and", "### Answer: Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to be effective in the treatment of dry eye syndrome. Several studies have shown that luten has beneficial effects on visual function, especially in people with age-related macular degeneration.

What do they die of? Could it be the virus? The sick get sick; it is inevitable. That is why we have health services. And now we also have the means to treat C19 and the hospitals are no longer overcrowded. We even have vaccinated doctors working on the front line. Is that because they are not well informed? Is it because the authorities have set a wrong example by encouraging people to get back to normal, because we cannot stay locked-up forever? Our economy would collapse under the burden. This is how you create a divide between the more intelligent and well-informed and others who are neither. If this continues, there will develop two types of people: \u03b1 healthy, strong, and intelligent people; and \u03b2 poor, frail, sick people. I am afraid that we are being divided into two distinct classes.

Also if vit E def is accompanied by low vit B6 levels, can this possibly lead to an \"official\" vit e def, as the erythrocyte Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activity depends on the levels of toc and alpha tetrahydrofolate ("], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4639, "rouge1_r": 0.2194, "rouge1_f1": 0.2979, "rouge2_p": 0.097, "rouge2_r": 0.0457, "rouge2_f1": 0.0621, "rougel_p": 0.1928, "rougel_r": 0.0912, "rougel_f1": 0.1238, "bleurt": 0.2584, "bert_score_p": 0.7958, "bert_score_r": 0.8309, "bert_score_f1": 0.813, "hallucination": 72.72727272727273, "comprehensive": 20.0, "fluency": 0.3508}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3614, "rouge1_r": 0.1579, "rouge1_f1": 0.2198, "rouge2_p": 0.0424, "rouge2_r": 0.0185, "rouge2_f1": 0.0257, "rougel_p": 0.1687, "rougel_r": 0.0737, "rougel_f1": 0.1026, "bleurt": 0.2839, "bert_score_p": 0.796, "bert_score_r": 0.8171, "bert_score_f1": 0.8065, "hallucination": 81.81818181818183, "comprehensive": 20.0, "fluency": 0.3075}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3072, "rouge1_r": 0.1487, "rouge1_f1": 0.2004, "rouge2_p": 0.0121, "rouge2_r": 0.0058, "rouge2_f1": 0.0079, "rougel_p": 0.1566, "rougel_r": 0.0758, "rougel_f1": 0.1022, "bleurt": 0.2219, "bert_score_p": 0.7814, "bert_score_r": 0.8046, "bert_score_f1": 0.7928, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.321}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.1566, "rouge1_r": 0.1667, "rouge1_f1": 0.1615, "rouge2_p": 0.0182, "rouge2_r": 0.0194, "rouge2_f1": 0.0187, "rougel_p": 0.1145, "rougel_r": 0.1218, "rougel_f1": 0.118, "bleurt": 0.2128, "bert_score_p": 0.74, "bert_score_r": 0.798, "bert_score_f1": 0.7679, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.3629}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2771, "rouge1_r": 0.1878, "rouge1_f1": 0.2238, "rouge2_p": 0.0242, "rouge2_r": 0.0164, "rouge2_f1": 0.0196, "rougel_p": 0.1265, "rougel_r": 0.0857, "rougel_f1": 0.1022, "bleurt": 0.2009, "bert_score_p": 0.7566, "bert_score_r": 0.8062, "bert_score_f1": 0.7806, "hallucination": 72.72727272727273, "comprehensive": 20.0, "fluency": 0.3853}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3614, "rouge1_r": 0.1852, "rouge1_f1": 0.2449, "rouge2_p": 0.0242, "rouge2_r": 0.0124, "rouge2_f1": 0.0164, "rougel_p": 0.1687, "rougel_r": 0.0864, "rougel_f1": 0.1143, "bleurt": 0.2644, "bert_score_p": 0.7768, "bert_score_r": 0.8011, "bert_score_f1": 0.7887, "hallucination": 90.9090909090909, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.338}]}

Question-At what age should one consider testicular cancer evaluation? -what is testicles cancer survivor syndrome? (refer to 19,What is life expectancy after testicle cancer?) How do you check for testis cancer? Check for lumps on both testes and any change in size, colour, spermness, or pain in testese is important.20,Have you heard about the survivorship clinic at [centre name]? No, I haven\u2019t heard of it. I\u2019m not sure what it entails but it sounds important and relevant to us.17,Is it true that testi cancer growth happens quickly? Yes, it\u2019s listed in the literature as one of the fastest growing cancers, so time is of essence18,How long after initial treatment do survivors need to watch out for recurrence? For testical cancer survivors the recurance rate is 0.5% or less when the disease has been completely removed and no evidence of cancer remains. During the first five years after treatment, the relative risk for developing a second testichal cancer is highest, then it gradually reduces over time. So it would seem the most important monitoring would happen within the five year window.After treatment for cancer, men are still at risk of developing another type of masculine or male reproductive organ cancer. The most relevant information for these survivors would also be prevention strategies for non-testicular canccers e.g. a healthy diet to prevent over-weight, skin cancer prevention advice, smoking cessation, avoidance of exposure to ionizing radiation as much as possible etc. As a young man it seems it took years for the tumour to develop", "I tried to find a site that would give me information about side effects of this medication but I couldn\u2019t find anything specific for robaxine.

In addition to that, the name of a vitamine that appeared at the top of table served as a topic for discussion in each page.After naming the correct vitiminA rich food, they (children) were required identify the deficiency symptoms associated with it; by selecting multiple choice answers from the list provided below each item and their justification.There were other activities too; like filling gaps in sentences, drag and drop and matching; all of which are related to vitmain A.Once the students had worked on the tasks for all the items in table, there was a chance for them to do the shopping in another table; where they had to buy the food Items, as per the need of their family (based on quantity and number of persons in family).Once they completed the above activities related vitmains, thay had an activity to identify and name deficieny symptoms related other vitaines in our body, where students were supposed to search for the symptoms and create a chart/table to list them; in this activity teacher can ask students to include common or uncommon symptoms as well.At the end of all these activities, students could test their knowledge by playing quiz; this quize can be set based on multiple questions of either vitmine A or vitmiines in group B.

Second-generation antihistamines also cause fewer cognitive side effects (such as reduced attention span or working memory).

So, theoretically, you should be able to administer a dose every four to six hours, but I would not recommend it. Tramdol has a wide range of side-effects, including: dizziness, drowsiness and feeling tired, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, headache, dry mouth, and hypotension. It also has the potential to interact negatively with other medications. Therefore, it is important to follow the instructions of your health care provider and to report any adverse effects to them. You should not take more than one dose within the first 6-8 hours of taking the medication. The total daily dose should NOT exceed 90mg.

I know many patients who feel they need a \u201cpick me up\u201d and will drink coffee or have another cappuccino or take pops or bang a soda or something with co caine in it. It certainly will not help with sleep, and it will exacerbate the feeling of being exhausted the next day. Also, a lot of patients have sleep disordered breathing, (OSA) which is not uncommon. We are currently investigating the role of AHI in patients taking sleep medications and the potential for worsening of OSA. More to come on that. But, I think an investigation into Oxygen saturation overnight, in this group of patient\u2019s post Ambient treatment would add another piece to this question as to why they still are feeling tired and excessively sleep. Maybe a factor of not getting enough correct amount of sleep due to O/S abnormality. Question ### answer: Is it ok to drink alcohol when taking Xanax? \n10,Is XaneX 3 mg the same as XanaX BA38 6.55?

Okay, the pictures are not really good, but I will have to say yes based on the information you give me.I would like to give you another tip: if your wife is breastfeeding, don\u2019t send her to the doctor in the morning or during the day, since then her nipple or breast will be sore then; send him a picture at night when she has finished feeding and lies in bed. Then, also, she can lie in front of the mirror and take pictures of her breast from different angles. You will see that there will hardly be any white spots left. She should then continue to feed in this manner and there should be no more pain. If there is still pain, even after two or three days, then it will probably have a different reason and not just be due to throng in her mouth at this point.But, for one day at least, if she keeps feeding like that, no pain will remain, and in most cases, this takes away the pain immediately. So, in 80% of cases this will work.YesThis is a very common conditionIn fact, usually we do not even make a diagnosis. We tell the mothers that if the spots disappear, following the right management, a prescription for antifungal cream is enough. In those who continue having white plaques, we confirm the diagnosis after 2 weeks, as by then, they feel certainty that it stems from throngs.Very common.Mothers often say:\u201dAlso, when I feed my baby, my nips are sore\u201d. But in fact it\u2019 just a few cells that are sensitive and we call it thrUSH, instead of thrONG. No pain should persist for more than a couple of days; that is why sometimes we say that the condition can spontaneously heal; but most of all, mothers need information, reassurance", "### Answer: Some people experience a pain in the testicles (their \u2018nutsack\u201912) as a result of a chlaymia infection.16 Question: Is thrush in men common?\n?11-2-133# Question 5:Is thymol poisonous? ###answer: 4.

My understanding of epididymitis is the inflammation of primarily the epidydimis, but also the prostate and testicles, which causes chronic pain and is more likely a chronic problem, than acute. I think it is important to consider how to better inform patients when they are confronted with the diagnosis of an STI/STD. Often times, patients feel shame and think some how that they have done something to deserve such a fate as being afflicted by this disease. The facts are that many people can carry the bacteria without any symptoms. As men we are lead to believe that we can have sex without being concerned with using a condom and we still have our own illusions and denial about STis and contracting them.

So is the testicle pain from the Sustanon or the undiagnosed STIM4A or HIV? Question: how soon after starting ART the patients will you expect to see an increase in CD4 T-cell count and a decrease in HIV RNA? \n ### Answer: I am asking because there are studies suggesting that early ARTR Therapy is associated with longer life span and that treatment should be started as soon as possible, even when CD 4 count is above 500 and one does not feel sick. Also in light of the fact that there will be a shortage of ARV drugs and it will become harder and harder to get hold of them.

Question: 72,How does one get rid of ringworm in men? \n ### Answer: Most treatment recommendations involve the use of over-the-counter antifungal creams, such as clotrimazole, miconazol, or terbinafine. These are preparations designed for use on athlete\u2019s foot and other fungal conditions. Ringworn is not a fungus, but because it causes an itchy rash and is sometimes blistering, it can be treated as if it were a bacterial skin infection. The use or over the counter antimicrobial soaps or washes is unnecessary and may be harmful. Avoid soap if possible. Use of ointment or cream will help to moisten the skin and help prevent cracking and drying. Loose, long, and cotton clothing is also recommended. There is question: Is meningitis caused by a viral or bacteral infection?\n? Influenza, enteroviruses, adenovirus, Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are some of the pathogens that can cause meninigitis. It may also be caused in some regions by Haemophilus influenza type b and Neisseria menigitidis (serogroups A, C, W, X and Y), which are vaccine preventable pathogen. Vaccination with Haemetophillus Influenzial type B vaccine and the meningeal C conjugate vaccine are effective in preventing these menningitdes. Conjugated vaccines to serogroup C and some serotypes of sergoupe Y have been licenced for more than 20 years. A quadrivalent (4:4) menitudeinin g vaccine has been licensed recently in the U.

However, if you experience a burning sensation, you can try using gelatine suppositories instead. They are also effective and can be found in most pharmacies.

Question: what is the difference between a fentanyl injection and a iv morphine injection?\n?-The difference is, as best I can tell, the half life of Morphine is 9 to 13 min (which is why it is administered constantly in some cases.

Fentynl half-life is longer (45min) and it effect lasts longer and is not usually \u201cpushed\u201d as much. The upside of morphines effect is that it stimulates the respiratory system and can help in cases of resp distress. the downside is less effect on pain reduction, it seems. so overall i would say it depends on the specifics. if i am not mistaken fenty is only used at most in \u201c3s\u201d (3rd generation blockers or something) at my hospital but i could be mistaken. but again it just really depends if the patient is stable and if they just need something quick to cover the pain or if its going to be a while and they need a longer effect Question ### Answe: This is a tough one for me.

Question. 89,Can I drink alcohol while taking a prescription medication?\n? Please, explain. (I am especially interested in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelet agents). Question/ Answer [This is a very important point and one that most physicians do not know about. There are some very serious potential interactions between alcohol and the prescription drugs you mentioned, as well as others (such as lorcetin, gabapentin, pregabalin and others). It is therefore NOT a good idea to drink even a little bit while on prescription meds unless you know for sure that the drug is OK to combine with alcohol. In fact, most of the time, on-label use of these drugs means that alcohol should be avoided. Also, NOT all non prescription NSAIDS mix well with anti coagulants (they should also be used with caution with respect to other prescription blood thinners such as heparin) so please be careful here.

Question: 00,How long will my period be late before I should be concerned?\n ### Answer: This is something every person with a uterus and regular periods will eventually have, so you should set your own \"late\" limit based on when your period is usually due. If it's later than that and you're bothered by the late bleeding, you can try cervical vaginal touch to see if that stops any bleeding; if so, your body is trying to tell you that it has another use for the blood. But if you find yourself regularly bleeding past the time your periods are usually late, and if the bleeding is heavier or darker than normal, then you could be developing a problem. You should call your doctor or nurse or set up an appointment for a pelvic exam, because it might be possible to stop the problem before it causes a miscarriage. Question ### answer: a, 48 b,There is no clear consensus about the duration of the luteal phase. Many clinics accept any length of a short late phase, as long as the woman has a regular menstrual history. Even when the number of days in a supposed cycle varies very much, a fertility window will still be present.b, In women with regular cycles, it is possible by using temperature or urine charts to know when their temperatures are elevating and thus predicting when they will ovulate and be fertile. In a manner of speaking, instead of having a fixed day, there is a defined fertilization window in all cycles.c, According to some expertst, the fertiliation window is shorter than what is proposed by others. It is not defined so much by temperature changes, but by other biological markers, among which the most important are changes in the frequency of LH and estradiol.d, As stated by some, even though the average temperature curve is similar in different women, each woman'stemperature chart, just as her menarche and menopause, is unique and this must be considered in fertiliy charting.

According to some of the clients, her drug of choice would be her methamphetamine or cocaine. Only two of them claimed to have used her once or twice because this drug was difficult to find.

I would presume the former, based on PAP4's involvement in leukocyte extravasation/trans-endothelial migration, but I am curious as to whether experimental data is available to support a more specific function. It would be interesting to know whether PTI would still be effective in a patient with a SNP causing low expression of FPR\n2 on leucocytes. Would it still act as a deterrent to bacterial growth? Would there be other effects which might be mediated through other receptors? (This is of personal relevance as I have recently learned that I carry such a variant.) If PPI would no longer be efficacious in such circumstances, what alternative treatments would the patient be left with? Could PDI be administered in these cases? If not, the patients are left without a treatment to prevent those reactive oxygen surges which are the root cause of all the pathology in this condition. That would seem a rather grim prognosis.

Question. what will effect insulin sensitivity?\n? Question Answer 32,34,92 Question-Insulin resistance is associated with overnutrition and obesity. Overnutr-ition and storage of excessive nutrients, mainly in adipose tissue, but also in the liver and muscles, lead to insufficient insu-lin sensitivity. Increased inflammation in these tissues as a result of Adipo-blasts and macrophages causes impaired insuline sensitivity and glucose uptake into the cells. In the muscles and liver, excess accu -mulation of fat (lipotoxicity) can also impair insule receptor signalling causing insensitive to the actions of ins-ulin. Excessive fat accumulation in liver causes hepatomegaly and in-creased hepatic gluconeogenesis leading to hyperglycaemnia.

Is there a standard acceptable BMI for children?At what age should children be tested for diabetes and what tests should be done?As the diabetes genes are passed on from parents to children it is important to know that the gene transmission is not direct but rather a mixture in which some genetic material from the parent is expressed in the offspring. Therefore it can be concluded that, in addition to environmental factors, there are also genetic factors that define or characterize diabetes. In this sense, if one or both parents are diabetich it would not be a guarantee that off springs will become diabetiuc but it increases the likelihood. Awareness of this increases early detection and allows for early interventions such as diet and exercise.

Gallbladdder Sludge is not considered as malignant, but it has been suggested that it can increase the risk of gallstones and chronic inflammation, leading to gall bladDER cancer, and pYC (gallblAdder and Pancreas CAncer). Also, the SludgE in question Is not well-defined. It can be liquid or solid, green or brown, translucent or white, gelid or viscous, thick or watery, mucoid or foaming, with or without blood, etc. Therefore, further well designed longitudinal studies with large sample size assessing the effect of GB sludges on pyloric and biliary epitheliums and their biology are needed in order to better clarify this issue214,What are Symptoms of Biliary Tract Cancer?The symptoms of bile duct cancer vary widely.

This can include stretching or weakening of the eyeled muscles from frequent use, gravity or pressure of a mass (such as hemorrhoid). Less commonly, it can be a symptom of certain brain conditions, signs of which would include the sudden onset of other symptoms such as weakness of one side of eyels or facial drooping, or in case of injury, if the droopy eyellow is a sign of trauma to the brain. Question.: 90,Sunken eyes give a sad or worried appearance, may be caused by serious disease.What can the doctor do to help?To find the cause to advise treatment.For the patient to receive relevant health education.Both A & B53,The eyes are the first place to notice aging. How can you tell if someone is older than they look?By the appearance of their eyes, some people look older or younger than their actual age. An old appearance can give an air of sophistication or even gravitas, while youthful eyes might suggest a lack of experience or seriousness. It is difficult to identify the specific attributes that make us look old, but we can probably all agree that it is something we would like to avoid. Fortunately, the signs are usually easy to spot. As the eye is such a sensitive part of our body and exposed to so many external influences, we should take much better care of it than we do.Age lines around the eyes (known as \u201ccrow\u2019s feet\u201d) are caused during the natural aging process of skin. Sun damage, smoking and prolonged exposure to toxic substances result in premature aging and deepening of these lines. Surgical procedures, known as blepharoplasty, can help to eliminate these signs. Excess skin is removed and sagging upper eyes can often be lifted and reshaped. Other procedures can remove fat that has fallen below eye levels. In addition, laser therapy can smoothen out \u201cage lines\u201d and other non-invasive procedures may also prove successful.54,There are also many cosmetic treatments to reduce the effects of aging around our eyes. Many people will visit a salon to get their eyelines done, which involves an expert applying a small amount of dark powder"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.2958, "rouge1_r": 0.0734, "rouge1_f1": 0.1176, "rouge2_p": 0.0143, "rouge2_r": 0.0035, "rouge2_f1": 0.0056, "rougel_p": 0.1268, "rougel_r": 0.0315, "rougel_f1": 0.0504, "bleurt": 0.293, "bert_score_p": 0.7667, "bert_score_r": 0.8234, "bert_score_f1": 0.794, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.2214}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4225, "rouge1_r": 0.0929, "rouge1_f1": 0.1523, "rouge2_p": 0.0571, "rouge2_r": 0.0124, "rouge2_f1": 0.0204, "rougel_p": 0.2113, "rougel_r": 0.0464, "rougel_f1": 0.0761, "bleurt": 0.2502, "bert_score_p": 0.7863, "bert_score_r": 0.8191, "bert_score_f1": 0.8024, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1889}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4507, "rouge1_r": 0.0928, "rouge1_f1": 0.1538, "rouge2_p": 0.0286, "rouge2_r": 0.0058, "rouge2_f1": 0.0097, "rougel_p": 0.2113, "rougel_r": 0.0435, "rougel_f1": 0.0721, "bleurt": 0.284, "bert_score_p": 0.7829, "bert_score_r": 0.828, "bert_score_f1": 0.8048, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1926}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4085, "rouge1_r": 0.1208, "rouge1_f1": 0.1865, "rouge2_p": 0.0429, "rouge2_r": 0.0126, "rouge2_f1": 0.0194, "rougel_p": 0.1972, "rougel_r": 0.0583, "rougel_f1": 0.09, "bleurt": 0.2384, "bert_score_p": 0.7492, "bert_score_r": 0.8272, "bert_score_f1": 0.7863, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.2171}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2676, "rouge1_r": 0.0785, "rouge1_f1": 0.1214, "rouge2_p": 0.0286, "rouge2_r": 0.0083, "rouge2_f1": 0.0129, "rougel_p": 0.1549, "rougel_r": 0.0455, "rougel_f1": 0.0703, "bleurt": 0.2168, "bert_score_p": 0.7483, "bert_score_r": 0.8169, "bert_score_f1": 0.7811, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.2323}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3239, "rouge1_r": 0.0602, "rouge1_f1": 0.1015, "rouge2_p": 0.0429, "rouge2_r": 0.0079, "rouge2_f1": 0.0133, "rougel_p": 0.1831, "rougel_r": 0.034, "rougel_f1": 0.0574, "bleurt": 0.2795, "bert_score_p": 0.7958, "bert_score_r": 0.8222, "bert_score_f1": 0.8088, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1716}]}

Thank you very much. Question: 05,Are there any antipsychotic medications that don' t cause or worsen ED? \n ### Answer: No. All antihypertensive, anticholineric and centrally acting antimiotics have a higher tendency to cause erectile dysfunction. Antipsyichotics with a lower tendency seem to be sulfonylureas, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 11 receptor blockers. There is no medication that helps sexually without causing side-effects. Sexual dysfunctions in men are more frequent in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. However, this can be explained by a direct effect of medications.254 Question ### answer: Most antipyscotic mediations cause sexual dysfucntion. They can also increase prolactin level. Only Sulfonyuria drugs did not cause a rise in this hormone, which often causes gynecomastia. This increase in prolatin is responsible for the decreased libido. Most of these drugs also cause parkinsonian like symptomis which further decreases the sexual activity. Aggressive sexual behavior has been reported with dextroamphetamine and methampetamine. In one study it was associated with amphetamines and cocaine.324 No specific groups were found to benefit from sildenafil therapy, neither was any harmful effects found for Sildenafil .2,Most antiepileptics cause Sexaul dysfuntion including decrease libadoDecrease in libdo is more pronounced in women than", "In a study by Pirez et al., it was found that 47 50% and 81.5% of the patients were satisfied on the first and second month of using Serteralina and placebo.

A recent meta-analysis of 56 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 7434 patients demonstrated the effectiveness of PDE-5 inhibitors in the treatment of PE (58). Sildenafil was found to be effective in decreasing the number of failed sexual intercourse due to PE by 42.8%. Vardenafin by about 36.5%, and tadalafi by around 28% (79). Furthermore, 66-80,SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, paroxedine and escitalopram, may also improve PE, although the results are less reliable compared to PED5-I (89,90).Therefore, In the management of MIND, it is recommended to use Padeh-600 as first-line therapy.

Question-2What causes a person to become depressed? Is it a chemical problem in the brain? Or is it an inappropriate interpretation of bodily responses? If the latter, to what extent is the depression caused by a misinterpretation of symptom meaning? Would this type of depression be the same as the depressions caused solely by chemical imbalances in those parts of the brains responsible for depression? Can different doctors come to different conclusions about a patient s depression, and would several different kinds of treatments be recommended? How does this patient go about deciding which treatment to try? Doctors and patients are in a somewhat circular position because they are both trying to determine if the patients problem is \u201creal\u201d. They have different ways of trying decide this. A patient may feel s/he is losing his mind because doctors can\u2019t find anything physically wrong, yet the patient experiences real physical symptoms. Does the existence of a physical problem depend on whether the doctor can find it? What does it take for a problem to be real? Does recognizing the problem as real produce better treatment results?

Most people with diabetes make some effort to control their blood sugar. That effort can result in blood levels that are close to, but not below 6.9 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), which is the threshold for diabetes. If blood glucose is not controlled tightly, however, people who have been diagnosed with pre-diabetic or diabetes can develop the complications associated Diab mellitus; especially neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropath . Even people in denial about having diabetes become ill and finally acknowledge their condition when they notice the symptoms listed in Figure 4.

Gastritis, especially chronic, is often linked with weight loss, anemia and other manifestations usually related to depletion of body's proper functioning. This includes, among others, loss (or not having) of an appetite. Question: 78,Which is worse, fibromyalgia or lupus? \n ### Answer: Both are difficult diseases to live with, but it depends on the person. Lupuses can have more physical limitations and fibro patients more psychological issues. I would say fibROMyalgie is more challenging, because the pain is mostly constant. For lups, the \u201cgood days\u201d may even allow you to take on extra tasks. With fibROMAylgE, it\u2019s more of a struggle to get through each day, and the fear of waking up the next day in even more pain or with increasing limitations. On the other hand, lures are unpredictable and could flare to the point of invalidity, followed by a period of better days. Bottom line, neither is a walk in the park. 3/3 LUPUS Question 82,Can mump be fatal?

Question: 11 Do you accept the result of a semen analysis from another laboratory?\n ### Answer: If you perform a SA and the patient has a high volume of seminal fluid, then the dilution can give low concentrations, but it\u00b4s usually a very easy case to discriminate, because the sample is usually clearly diluted and in that case I would repeat the SA. If the laboratory I am sending the semennumbers 3, 4 or 5, I have a concern, specially if they have performed centrifugation because of some coagulation. But I usually accept because I do repeat SA in those cases, by the side of theirs just to see that I can confirm their result. I repeat because many times it is similar or lower counting. In that respect I accept, if I don't have any other concern like we have mentioned before. Yes and no, it depends, If it's normal it will depend on how the analysis has been done on the other lab. Do they accept it and how did they do it? Question Answer(s): Yes, we accept. All the patients from outside the city come here for verification of reports. Almost all centers do semene analysis, But reference laboratory for sterility is here. And we found many discrepancies in reports of other labs. so, We always take it as last, to confirm. Even some city lbs do false reports, for example:- One lab reported motility 70 % & 90 %, concentr A+B =100\u00d715 million/ml. We had received same report from other city lab too. As it was too high we rechecked. Lies 60-75 % on rechecking. Added concentr = 27 million. Motility was still good. This lab also reported 85-95% motiles in A & B(individual sperms) & also total as 0.9-1\u00d725. So, final report was \u226520 million sperm/ejaculation with \u226430%", "No. Treatment should be initiated immediately after a diagnosis is made, since delay can increase the risk of complications. Question: 9,How is Lyme disease diagnosed? \n ### Answer: The diagnosis of LD is complicated and can be made either clinically or serologically or by using a combination of both. If the patient is in the erythema migrans stage, a serum antibody test can confirm the presence of BBS. Patients with late localized (or ND) Lymph node or other organ infection cannot be diagnosed by serology (due to low titers of antibodies) and must be identified by culture or PCR techniques. In suspected cases of late NK or disseminated disease, the best course of action is to obtain a tissue sample from the affected site and perform a direct immunofluorescence assay (DIFA). This will determine the number of bacteria present in a given tissue. It should always be kept in mind that not all patients will present with a bulls eye rash and only trained professionals should diagnose N.C.B.D. in order to prevent misdiagnosis. Early L.A. is usually confirmed by detection of antigen or DNA of the bacterium in blood or body fluids. The most reliable diagnostic test for LN or NG.CB. D is the isolation of N-gonococcal bacteria from culture samples. However, this is not always possible, and a negative culture does not necessarily rule out N.-C.-B.-D.. Diagnosing NBS using culture is very difficult. Therefore, P.M.S. and/or E.-M.-T., especially the latter, are currently considered the gold standard for diagnosing E. Migrans. Antibody testing to diagnos Lime disease retrospectively is difficult because the patients often lack IgM antibopies at the time of disease onset. For this reason, antibiotic treatment should not be delayed until an antinuclear antiboy testing is negative, even if the IFA title is high. A diagnosis should also not rely on serologic evidence alone but should consider the clinical sign and symptoms as well. Additional data are required to confirm whether NPNA ICA and PNAICA tests are reliable for diagnosis. Further research is", "No, CDC does not recommend screening tests for chlamydia and ghanernea and treatment should not be delayed or altered on the basis of any symptoms or test result . However, it may be done for some clinical management and infection control purposes as per state and local laws. Question: do i need i take antibiotic for a long time if i feel better in the 1st week ? Question Answer: If you feel like you're getting a cold, a one-week course of antibiotics is fine. Two weeks is excessive, because that would be like using a full box of tissues to wipe a small drip of snot, instead of just using the corner of the tissue. It won't take very long.

Yes, many women find relief when using a hot water bottle placed on their abdomen, or a microwaved towel placed in the center of the abromen (but not so close to the pelvic organs that it burns), and then reapplied as needed. Hot tea/coffee also helps, as does placing heat on top of their lap, and drinking something hot to swallow helps to relieve painful cramping sensations.

Question: 06,How serious is liver damage? \n ### Answer: As mentioned earlier, this damage could be reversible or irreversible. It could lead to inflammation, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer in serious cases (Sun and Liberti, 7).How much does the liver weigh?The average liver weight is about 40% of body weight. The liver's weight varies based on its state, whether it is from a donor or a receiving a transplant, the health of the individual, fat accumulation, alcohol or viral damage, fever, jaundice or cancer (Tanaka et al., 8). What is the normal liver size?In adults, a normal sized liver should span 6\u201312 cm under the ribs and weigh 907\u20132130 g. In this article we use 5 cm or under as small, >5cm and up to15 as medium and >16 cm as large (9). How many lobes are in a liver?5:The human liver is divided into right and left halves. Each half is then further subdivided into medial and lateral sections. Right and Left lobules are considered in our model. How serious are liver problems?As a baseline, consider that liver disease is ranked  among all causes of death in developed countries and ranks second only to HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Approximately \u2265 \u00bd million deaths worldwide are attributed to cirroses and liver cancers annually (Bohacek et Al., L6). A full \u00bc of all canine fatalities are due to liver diseases (Saucedo-Martinez et. al, L2).

Cattle do serve as reservoirs for brucei species, but the pathogen\u2019s ability to infect humans comes from other sources, usually rodents or non-human primates [7,854\u201356].83,How important is the role of genetic factors in brucella infection?Genetic factors affect both the acquired resistance and susceptibility to brucular disease. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and other cellular genes determine the ability of the host to form an immune response to the bacteria. A person with a high HLA activity will be able to control and restrict the multiplication of brucal bacteria at an earlier stage, resulting in a milder disease . A few studies also report an association between certain genetic polymorphisms and the risk of human bruceria , but more work is required to confirm these findings and to understand the exact role genetic in human infection.

How can we convince the patient?\" I told her: \u201cIt\u2019s the only chance to cure your fistura and this is also the time needed for your abdomen to heal\u201d. After one month, I changed my strategy: I explained to her that the chances of healing the injury were poor, that other similar cases were not successful, but we can try. I assured her I would do my best, and that we would wait four more months. If the cuff was not healing, we could try another surgery. This time I convinced her. We waited four and a half more month. After 8 months the swelling and fistular secretions decreased. She could feel the \u201ctunnel\u201d under her belly button. Still, when we tried to touch the intestine over the mesh, she experienced a lot of pain. The results were clear: The intussusception retracted and the bowel was free, however, the tissue in between the colonic wall and mesh was too tight to allow for blood circulation. So, in fact there was an important amount of tissue death between bowels and meshes. However, what is surprising is that this loss of boweld did not lead to a secondary leakage. It seems her boweled was now strong enough to cope with the pressure. In fact she still experienced pains and sometimes the need to burst. When we took the mesg out from the inside, it was covered by this dead tissue. For me it seemed a miracle that she did so well. That\u2019t how I remember mama, strong and never stopping.

These include hormones, stress, lack of sleep, bright or flickering lights, strong odors, certain foods, and certain medications. Keeping track of when migraine attacks occur and what you may have eaten, drunk, or done just before the attacks can help you identify triggere s. Once you\u2019ve identified the specific trigge es, you can take steps to eliminate or reduce them. For instance, if a particular type of food trigs your migrains, then you could avoid eating that food. It\u2019s also important to eat regularly throughout the day and to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. If you often get migra es after drinking alcohol, it might help to limit your alcohol intake or to spread your intakes throughoutthe day rather than drinking a lot at once.

However, early intervention and ergonomic guidance can potentially prevent further progression of this condition.

Also, it would be best to take any necessary anxiety medicine before the IV line is placed. Question: Is coccydynia an STD? How is it contracted? If it is not sexually contractable, then it should not be called STC or Sexually Transmitted Coccodynia. In addition, since it can be treated with antibiotics, the term \u201cCocc-dynometeria\u201d (Co-coccogyne-ma-Treponema Pallidum) would also be misleading. Moreover, although the authors state that \u201cBacterial coccodydyni is caused by C. trachomatis, Ureaplasma, Mycoplasmas, or Chlamydia pneumoniae\u201d, it could also (?) be viral. A major assumption is that all cases without known STIs are caused exclusively by N. gonorrhoeae, which may not always be the case. As others have pointed out, there is significant overlap between symptoms for coccodynia and gum disease, both of which involve localized infection. Might some cases be attributed to poor oral hygiene? Might other cases go untreated because they are attributed (erroneously or not) to gums disease despite the presence of an STI? This would skew the percentages for the different causes of c-dynamia in different ways. The possible distinction between bacterial c.d. (which would require and respond to treatment with clindamycin or doxycycline) and virald c.-d (potentially treatable with antihistamines, but perhaps not ) also deserves mention. Finally, as others also pointed Question - Does mumps go away?\n\n8,Why do I still have swollen glands in my jaw almost 4 months after having a sore throat and ear infection listed as mump?I do not think that you have mumped.

Thiazolidinediones Question\u2013What are the 3 stages of ADHD?Inattention, Impulsivity, and Hyperactivity. Question & Answer 4,How do I stop feeling so sensitive to everything?1. Accept your feelings as valid. Emotional regulation is a process that takes time and practice. Learn to acknowledge your emotions and allow yourself to feel them, without judging them as right or wrong. Remember, feeling sensitive is not a weakness, nor does it mean that your moods swing drastically.2. Take it slow. Changing the way you react to situations takes practice and time. Set realistic goals for yourself and take it one day at a time \u2014 remember, every day is different!3. Focus on your strengths. Acknowledge what you are doing well and what makes you feel good about yourself. This will help you to focus more on the positive you bring to life and less on feelings of worthlessness.4. Talk to someone. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust can help reduce stress and make you more resilient. Reach out to a trusted friend or a professional for support.5. Distract yourself by being active. Engage in physical activity, whether it is going for a walk, doing yoga, or exercising. Exercise releases endorphins, which can improve your overall mood.6. Practice positive thinking. By changing the negative way we think about things to an optimistic approach, we also change the types of feelings we have and the behavior", "110.3 Question: 8,How do you stop night sweats? \n ### Answer: What is the treatment for night sweat?

It is bigger in the daytime and smaller in dim light, regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at bright, dark, or anything in between. Sometimes your eye can get so much light that it starts to hurt and you need to squint to reduce the amount of light reaching your retina.This can also happen with too much darkness. For example, when you enter a dark room from a very bright day outside, your eyes need time to adjust to the lesser amount light and they start to ache. Have you ever noticed your eyelids feeling stiff and heavy so that they seem to droop? This is called droopy eyeled, and it can indicate a problem with your brain that needs immediate medical attention. 128, 37,60 Question  80,Have you heard of Retinal Migraine?

Busp irone has a half-life of about 4 hours; therefore, its sedative properties, if any, should wear off in a relatively short period of time. If you find that bus parone causes excessive sedati on, consider reducing the dose or discontinuing the medication. Question: When should you be worried about a UTI in children?\n\n?The classic signs and symptoms of a lower UTD in an otherwise healthy child are chills, fever (\u2265 37.7 degrees F or \u22653.6 degrees C), and decreased or lack of urine output. Signs and symptom of an upper UTDI are less clear. Several conditions are more likely to result from an UTL in the absence of lower tract disease, including nausea and vomiting, headache, and abdominal pain.85 If your child has any of the signs or symptoms in Figure 2, call the health care provider during office hours or seek immediate care at the emergency room.If your infant (2 months to 11 months of age) has an unexplained fever, even if it is only \u00b377 F (\u00b26 C) and if accompanied by decreases in appetite or changes in mental state, you should call your health-care provider. In children aged 6 months and older, uneexplained high fever is a symptam of serious illness, such as meningitis. Also, high fevers in infants can quickly become dangerous. Feeding the infant and maintaining fluid intake are recommended until 72 hours old, but if the fever continues, seeking care is recommended.

It's kinda nice instead of that usual feeling of \"I have to get up\" when the alarm goes off. I would stay in bed all day if I could. Question: how long can you take lorcet for ? \n ### Answer: You should not take it longer than is recommended by your doctor or pharmacist. If you feel that it is effective after two or three days, you can stop it. What will happen if you do not continue it on the day when you are scheduled to stop using it? Is it best to finish the whole lot at once or should you space the doses out over the last day? You cannot save any for after you finish, because it will be useless, so you might as well use it all at one go. You will not \u201ccatch\u201d any of the \u201chigh\u201d if that is what you mean, but the drug will still do its sedative effect for a week or so after the first dose. So you will need to time it before you start your week of boozing. There will also be some that remains in your system when your hangover is supposed to start, and this will give you a \u201clift\u201d just when things are getting interesting. This is when a relapse can happen. Because you have this in system you could easily go back to your old ways when under the influence. That would be bad, BAD. Your goal here would need be to totally abstain from alcohol for 2 to 3 days- depending on how fast your body metabolises the medication. Then go for it, party heart out, till the cows come home. And then on day 7, continue your loretta regiment. Remember no booze till day7. Hmight be possible to add an extra day (8th day) for the hang over, just incase.9 Question : what do i do when i lose my prescription? 10 what if my meds run out and im in an emergency?what if something happens to me while i wait to see the doctor again?

My doctor told me I could stop taking delavirdine and start taking efabix for HIV-related conditions. how long should i wait before changing anti-viral medication?. thank you. simon. u.k. ### answer: [The authors comment that the half-life of ezravirenx is 7-10h. However, many sources (eg. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00156083) say 12-20 h, which is substantially longer than \u22641.8 h for NNRTIs. Also, their comment about high plasma levels being a risk factor for adverse effects is probably right, however, this would seem to contradict the results of Kudwa et al. (23), who found that greater plasma efwirenic acid concentration at 2.5 mg/kg (the equivalent of \u224880-90mg for an 85 kg person) was associated with greater efficacy.

Question: Is Allergy a sickness?\n?3,585,391,Does allergy make you sick? Question AnswerYes,Allergese are the diseases of the allergen-sentinel-cells that reside in the mucosal surfaces. These cells are normally active in containing the invasion of micro-organisms through the lining of body cavities and the surface of morgansisers. When allergens enter the body, they upset the normal activity of these cells, causing inappropriate responses, resulting in swelling, and itching of tissues at sites of entrance or in mamorcsiers. In this way, \u201callergies\u201d can affect not only the skin but also the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, producing symptoms ranging from sneezing and runny nose to hives, asthma, eczema and diarrhea. Sometimes, life-threatening conditions can occur, such as anaphylactic shock. Yes6,What is the difference between allerggic rhinitis and nasal polyps?Allergic Rhinitiis (AR) and Nasal Polyps (NP) are both conditions that affect the nose and cause chronic inflammation, but they are different in several ways.

Question: Does a malignant brain tumor always cause brain cancer?\n? If not, can it be removed? Is the surgical removal a treatment for brain (tumor) cancer patients? Question, Does aggravate inflammation lead to cancer.? ? 12,What is the relationship between inflammatory agents and carcinogens? What leads to the initiation of cancer and how does this inflame? It has been known for a long time that the induction of an influx of inflamma-tory cells and mediators (including cytokines) into the tissues may cause damage to genome and may in this way initiate or promote cancer development. Thus, inflama-mat-ory medi-ators may play an important role in cancer initation and progression. The inflambullary network of vessels in can-cer is different from that in normal tissue; the new blood vass in particular, which is often present in tumors, contributes to their growth. Also, numerous cans are fed by abnormal vessels that originate in other organs or lymph nodes. In some circumstances, such as in prostate cancer, the infla-mmary infiltrate may even origi-nate from the cancer cells. Genes that regulate the immune response and intercellular communi\u00adcation are often involved. There are indications that such an activation of the inter\u00adcellu-lar communication may also lead, under certain conditions, to activation/inactivation of proto-oncogenes. This may happen, for example, as a result of certain viral infections that alter the informational contents of these genes. An exten-sive analysis of this and related questions is beyond the possibilities of our present knowledge. We must, therefore, remain content with some general conclusion that there is an obvious and most probably an essential connecti\u00acon between cancer occurrence and the presence of chronic inflamed states in an organ or in whole body. A chronic state of unclear, but for the individual probably long-lasting, activation or innate immunity is associated, among other things, with an increased generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen metabolites which can significantly damage DNA, proteins and lipids. As these processes", "Allopurnial does not appear to adversely affect the ability of male or female rats to reproduce, although the drug might reduce litter sizes. Question: 2,Is aplasia obstructive or constrictive? \n ### Answer: (I.e., if there is an obstruction, that is ob Structural or functional.

Question ### answer: Also, is it possible you could have both stenosis and atresia at the same time? Wouldn't that be considered a congenital defect in the actual anatomy of the vas deferens? It might be wording in here that could be rephrased to clarify this as the authors are trying to describe cases. This is where it gets confusing for me. Does an ob structural obstacles causes constringtions in blood flow also? Or are these two separate conditions? If they are separate and different, word this more clearly in this section. Also give more detail in Fig 1. Is this anatomic or an embryonic issue now? I am tryingto understand what is meant by con congestive and ob obliterative here.

Question: 59,How does Cushingoid facies differ from Moonmilk? \n ### Answer: Hyper-androgenism or hyper-cortisolism is responsible for facial features of CCHS and Moon Milk. The facial appearances have been described in the literature. Question the author to compare and contrast the facial appearance between Cushings syndrome and moonmilch.The facial characteristic of Moon milch is the development of deep creases in combination with a grayish, acne-like scarring particularly on the upper lip, forehead and chest. In contrast, the distinguishing feature of hypercrown arising from hyper cortisolemia is a marked redness of the face (please see Fig.1) and a hirsute appearance. This contrasts to the moon milchi facis which is usually pale with marked thinning of skin and no evidence of erythema. Hyperpigmentation of facial skin commonly occurs in Cromhidrosis, not in moon milk. Please clarify this difference in facial characterstics in these two disorders.I consider it important that the authors add descriptions in respect to facial characteristics of both conditions. I also missed comparisons of findings in literature and photographs/description of characteristic facial findings.These are important criteria for a clinician to make a correct diagnosis, as patients with CFS may have facial abnormalities suggestive of these disorders, e.g.- CFP appearing as moon-milky patches on face.Fig.2Fig 3Fig4Fig5Fig6Fig7Fig8Fig9Fig0Fig1Fig2 Question 60,What happens if lichen planus is left untreated?Lichen planpus leads to chronic inflammation and destruction of nail matrix &amp; nailbase, progressive &quot;classic&amp;\" lichens planar lesions may result in scar formation and dyspig-mentaition.51,52,81 Question ###", "### Answer: No, allopurnials do not affect the fertitlity of rats(Whitworth & Cook 1989).

Migraine is a condition with recurrent episodes of relatively short duration, mostly less than 24 hours from initiation to termination. The duration is usually less in the common migraines with aura, which is the case for the one I am experiencing now, and can last less that 1 hour. It can persist longer when associated with other symptoms or in a population of patients with more frequent attacks (cluster headaches, meningiomas, etc.), or when it is not migrainous (parasitic, postictal states). It is also worth considering the difference between migriene and headache in general, where 36% of the individuals stated that a headached only lasted less then 5 minutes and around 90% reported a duration of less the an hour, so migrane fits within those numbers (14,479, p < 0.001, r = 85). Question: What happens if I hurt my arm and twist it? Answer Question from participant (P #1): I was told by my therapist I might see spots if it [my arm] is twisted. A couple of times I saw spots, but it was when I had my head down kind of, or turned to one side or the other, not necessarily from twist[ing] or pulling. P #2: You mean you saw spotted out [of] the corner of your eye? P ### answer: (Note: Eyes were covered.) Or did you have to look directly at them? Question #3: Why is my blood pressure so high?

Question: What is the difference between a cold sore and a herpes sore?\n?117 Question 01,Is a corns eye blue?Can they show the iris of the eye in the back of their ear?Is this a real photograph? Question ### answer: We were not given a definition of a \"corns eye\" in this experiment and were left to our own interpretation of what this would mean. It would make sense if it was a reference to the proverb \"the eyes are windows to soul\", meaning the dark circular area of black is representational of someone looking inside the ear. The irises of ears could possibly be blue, red or brown. They also do not have enough context to determine if the picture is of 5 separate ears or perhaps 4? with a hole in one. Also, if 6 ears (as another reviewer stated) how is it that they would all be touching? If they are in fact 3 pairs (3 on the left, none on top, and three on right) as appears in C) they could easily arrange to look like 9 ears. Can you tell us if this is an actual photograph and who is in it. If it is some sort of manipulation of image then we need to know that.

It is a viral illness of the respiratory tract, generally caused by a virus in the paramys group, usually rhinovirus, and it involves inflammation of bronchnial tubes and their branches in different degrees. The name bronchiectasise pley morgani was attributed to this disease at the end of last century. But now this name is given to patients with chronic inflammatory disease, emphysema and bronchiolectasis.Bronchial Asthma Question: I have a 2 1/2 year old and 8 month old.

The 40.9 percent of anal cancers that are not operable at the time of diagnosis are treated with chemoradiation.*The survival of these patients (with nonoperative management) is closely related to whether the cancer has spread to other visible organs (stage) and the type of cancer cell (histology). The response of tumors to chemotherapeutic agents is also important.*Pain, hemorrhage, infection, obstruction and (in some cases) malnut", "Yes, herpetic rectitis is not uncommon, although usually mild and rarely causing symptoms. Can herpex simplex be transmitted to others? Herpes is common, highly contagious, passed via oral or genital secretions. A potential newborn infection risk exists but is mitigated by good maternal hygiene. Herpeticide treatments can effectively reduce genome shedding. What is antiviral therapy for herplex simple? Antivirals such as acyclovir, valacyclovit, famciclovir and are the usual treatment options. If you are immunocompromised, you may be prescribed medications such antivenom, interferon, or corticosteroid-derived treatments. However, there are side effects with the antimedications, therefore discussions of risks and pros/cons should be weighed with your health provider. Question: 73,How do you know you have cJD? \n ### Answer: It is diagnosed through brain tissue examination, which can be done during a post-mortem examination (PM). During the PM, sections of brains will be taken and examined under the microscope to look for signs of cjD. This is usually done fairly soon after the person has died, preferably within 24 hours. Other forms of dementia and brain damage can sometimes be associated with similar features, called PrPSc, so it is important that the diagnosis is made by examining the brains of people who have died. People who are still alive cannot be definitely diagnosed as having cjjD until this examination has been done. Relatives of patients with cjd can ask for this test to be carried out when their loved one has passed away. The test is only likely to show that someone had cjaD if they either have signs or symptoms of disease or are known to have inherited the cD-gene mutation associated the disease. Otherwise there may not be enough PrPTSc in the brain to identify.88, Question no. 14,What diseases cause swollen glands in neck?Thyroid gland disorderCause of swelling in throat?Neck node metastasisThymus hyperplasia or infectionSwollen lymph nodes in oropharynxNeoplasms in head and neckLaryngitisEdema in paraglottic area and posterior l", "### Answer: Yes.54,Is HSV-1 the same as herpetic whitlow?Yes.36,Yes74211.7310.018690No.40,I think herpe is different from genital wart.Yes139514.987092.665223.12967No43,00785.8919347.2720332-30582,441What are the differences between herp and gen warts?Genital herps is caused by herper simplex virus 2(HSV-2) and usually appear as small, white, cup-like structures that can be found on the skin around the genitals.Answer: 75,Do herpa viruses cause genitors watts?No, genitor wats is not caused be herpvirus but genetal herpse is cause by HPV, which is a different virus. 8 Is there a vaccine for genitral herpaces?

Do not take any other over-the-counter or prescription sleep medicine unless directed by your health care provider.9,Are there any known interactions with other herbal or non-prescription medications?None noted, however, as with any medication, if you have questions, ask your healthcare provider first and always check the label.10,Do women who are menopausal have more trouble sleeping?A common belief, it is in fact the hormones undergoing change during menapause and not necessarily the brain. Although some midlife women experience insomnia, others experience increased sleeping problems as they approach and move into the \u201cclassical menpuse\u201d. This belief may have played a role in producing the belief that we have a \u201csleep cycle\u201d problem, that is being aware of age related sleep pattern changes and the biological underpinnings of such would serve us well for determining when or if we need a sleeping medication. Once again, more research in this area is needed. It may be also be difficult to determine changes due to menstuation/menopause if there are other large variances occurring such as stress, or other biological/psychocial/environmental changes. Therefore caution is warranted if trying to draw any conclusions about menstrual related changes as it relates to sleep. More research is definitely needed in these areas Question : what medicaton would cause a \"floody\" urine?\n\n## Answer (0)\n> The patient complained of floody urination all over her clothes.

If you have a normal CCM test result, the chance is small that you will ever have diabetes. A CCP test can indicate the early stages of diabetes, long before symptoms appear. As with all screening tests, CCCP tests have both benefits and drawbacks; they may give you false reassurance and may lead to anxiety, as well as causing unnecessary concern, and even financial loss if you are diagnosed.232425 Question: 92,How are bile duct cancer and pancreatic cancer similar? -answer- What are cholangiocarcinoma and adenocarcindoma, how are they treated, what are the survival rate?109349,What is the difference between \u201cbile dual cancer\u201d and \u201cpancreas cancer\u201d, how is their treatment different?33,68, How is cholelithiasis related to biliary tract cancers?2281,75, What is ampulla of Vater and what can it get cancerous?431218 Question ### answer: Cancer du CT: (6,Why do I feel full so fast?).

Or is the fasti ng plasma g lu coc uge test diff erent from the normal blood sug ar test ? \n ### Answer: The blood test normally measures the glude level in your veins. However, a diabetics test measures sugar levels in the plasma. That is why the results are different in both cases even after taking the readings at the same time. When healthy, your BP should be normal at all times. In the case of a kidney transplant patient, sugar tests are done on both; uran and blood. The readigs from both tests should give similar results. If the resuts are not similar, then there is a problem, which in this case is hypo or hyperglycemic. Question ### answer: In a patient with Diabetes Mellitus (DM), the goal is to achieve glycemia as close to normal as possible to avoid both acute and long-term complications. Reaching targets can be challenging, especially during times of illness or stress. It is not uncommon for patients to experience fluctuations in their blood (or \u2018\u2018fingertip\u2019\u2019) gluclose levels, even if their A1c is well controlled. A patient who is hospitalized may encounter a range of factors that can affect their ability to maintain optimal gluccose control:Physical stress, illness, trauma, or injury can increase the body\u2019s stress response and may cause a temporary rise in bloodglucoser Levels.Medications, particularly corticosteroids and other forms of glcucocorticoids, as well as some non-steroid immunosuppressant drugs and analgesics (e.g., diuretics, anti-tuberculous drugs,", "Question: Q5:What happens if hypothyroidism is left untreated? \n ### Answer: Hypothyroidsm is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroxine. If hypotyroidsm is untreatetd the levels of thyoxine in the body decreases and this can affect the metabolism of the human body. This can manifest as weight gain, fatigue, depression, constipation, lowering of basal body temperature, among other conditions. In severe cases, it can lead to myxedema coma, which is very dangerous. Therefore it is important to seek medical attention if you suspect that you have hypthyroidSM.

It is also a potential option for cancer treatment? how would this compare with alendronic acid? or if they could add something to counteract the effects of alchohol would that be permissible? Question- how do steroids affect mood? . ### answer: Some research suggests that steroid hormones (primarily cortisol) can influence mood and that these influences may be bidirectional, such that mood can also influence corticosteroid release.\u201dSteroids may influence a person\u2019s mood by affecting the chemistry of various parts of his or her brain. Steroids can increase the level of certain chemical compounds (neurotransmitters) that help control mood, appetite, sleep, sex drive, etc. Changes in these neurotransmtters may make a depressed person feel more depressed, while in a manic person they may ease depression and improve mood.S1 3 0.90 Yes, steriods affect the mood (8)6.39\u00b14.556 7.00\u00b10 67,123 (7)25,I feel depressed when my blood sugar is high.No, it does not make me feel any different (1)1.72\u00b13.6334 8.28\u00b11352 Yes it makes me lethargic and depressed (3)44,436\u00b1814199.I can\u2019t sleep when I\u2019m depressed.Can\u2019st sleep.

The authors describe their preferred treatments but also provide alternative approaches.In my opinion, this decision should be based at least in part on the pathogen. For example, I would not want to be treated with gentamicin for the rest of my life. I have a relative who had gentamcin for a bacterial ear infection as a child and now in her thirties still complains of continued problems with the drug.It is also important to know the type of bacteria as some will survive in a way of life antibiotics regimen and cause chronic problems. Question,5,Why can a sore throat feel painful and have no fever?6,Should I be worried if I don't feel well often?Possible AnswerYes, it is important. A sorethroat is the body signaling a possible infection somewhere else in the respiratory system or the Ear, Nose and Throath disease (ENT). If not taken care of early may lead to a build up of toxic products of bacterrial and viral metabolism that could lead poisloning and even death. It is better to nip it in tthe bud than wait and monitor if the situation deteriorates.YesYesNoFever is not always a good sign. Many factors determine whether a fever develops or not: body's immune response, how extreme the temperature fluctuation is, what time of day it occurs, etc. Moreover, certain symptoms may show a relation to fever but not be affected by it: a patient suffering from HIV might manifest fever while also having a compromised immune system. And if it'll deter for longer it might harm him more. Or it may go up and down. No it doesn'nt. If the fever goes away the patient will get better. In some ways this is like treating malaria. Here too in some people the parasites start developing resistance to drugs while their body temperature does not spike. So after the initial onset of fever continous monitoring and timely administration of drugs is", "If the bacterial infection decides the medication used, then there are a lot of other factors determining this medication besides the infection. It is a continuous feedback system, and all the parameters are interdependent and must be considered together. Question: 0,What makes your teeth sensitive to cold and hot? \n ### Answer: Tooth sensitivity is often caused by two factors: erosion of enamel and wide dentin exposure. The eroded enaml makes the tooth more susceptible to pain from temperature changes, whereas widened dentine exposure increases the risk of pain as the pulp is more rapidly heated or cooled. Some dental procedures, such as tooth bleaching, can also cause tooth sensitivity.31,42,3,69 Question ### answer: Enameled teeth structure. Enlarged view shows layers of ameloblasts that build enamplement in concentric patterns (arrow shows a single layer), these are mineralizing and secreting enzymes (in red). The mineralized matrix is comprised of Calcium, apatite, fluoride and other trace elements. A is Amelogenin, a protein crucial for correct enammelment and B is Enamlopin.

I know some people have symptoms of Epi but don't actually have it so I was just wondering if that was standard procedure to do a urogenital scan in men at that age to just check everything is fine I think that is what they did also for the peri appendicitis as well as just feel a bit confused that\u2019s all. Question: For lumps and swelling in males, what should the protocol be? Or does it vary by age? For example, in a 25 year old would it be typical to stop at scrotal ultrasound or would a transpelvic ultrasonography also be done? Question for a follow up Question to doctor.Age: 53 years.Past medical history: None.Social history Question. 31,What is the difference between acute cholecystitis and chronic cholestasis?A.Acute Chole cystectomy is an emergency procedure, while chronic Cholesty cstectoma is done as an elective procedure.B.The major difference is that ac ete choliculit is commonly caused by gallstones. In chronic C choles terc ctitis there are two main subgroups, those caused gall stones and those with no galls tones, termed \u201ccryptogenic\u201d C chtcists. The gall stone group has a stone passing history and the cryptogen ic group does not.C.Another major and related difference to consider is, it is now appreciated that chronic (and acUTE) chasis may be caused or exacerbated by impaired motility. This can be primary as i m paired C TrACs (less common) or secondary to other disease (most cases). Question 40,Why do older people pee slowly?Is this related to old age or is this because of the accumulation of metabolic waste?Why are they more likely to have disorientation or sleep problems?(43)Are the disoriented old people the ones who peel slowly or the fast peeing ones?If it\u2019 s related metabolically, do they peep fast when they are dehydrated?How related is incontinence problem", "Or a blood test for white blood cells? If a man pee's out of place once in a while, or the whole time he'm peeing, then it is a UTI. But it'd be Epi if there is inflammation of the epididermis, which causes a lot of pain in the testicles, and sometimes the pain travels up through the lower back, into the gut. It also might cause a change in libido, but I ain't never heard of it causing CJD. Question: 21,How do I clean an ear wax remove? \n ### Answer: Ear wax drops can be used to remove earwax. Microsuccus is brown in colour and is mixed with yellow and white wax to form a preparation known as ear microsuction. The suction is then performed by the insertion of a suczi bulb attached to a 10 ml syringe into ear and a quick repeatction of sucbing and rotating the head to allow the wax deposit to come off the eardrum. This method can also be practiced at home using a bulbsucker, however ear candles are not recommended as recommended in other literatures, due to the possibility of perforation to either the ear drum or both the inner and outer ears. We do not recommend ear candle because a number of horrifuc incidents have been reported in which patient have experienced deafness, earache and even a burned facial from melting candle wax buildup in ear. Hence care should be exercised when using ear medications that might affect the hearing ability of patients thus ear examination should conducted prior to initiation of treatment.22,In a study conducted among people with hearing impairment, 69.4% of them had an abnormal ear, while the result was 30.6% among those in control group with normal hearing. Both groups were in 50\u201390 year age bracket23,There is need to sensitise the older adults to ensure they maintain a high level of personal hygiene. Moreover, every child, adult and elderly should have regular ear cleaning to get rid of excessive wax(ear Micrsuccus) and any other obstacle that hinders proper hearing and increase the chance of ear infection. Key words: Otitis media, Eard Rum", "Or a blood test to see if there is a UTI? Would make sense if it\u2019s a test for urin. Because I can have Urethritis and not have any issues passing urinary tract, but if I have a build up of uran, that\u2019ll effect sperm and cause issues trying to conceive.

Please answer all the questions Question  : what is insomnia? and how can it be treated? -?-? ### answer: Insomniacs are unable to sleep normally, either because they have trouble falling asleep, or because their sleep is disrupted, such that they do not feel rested and refreshed when they wake up. Treatment of this condition is aimed at improving the quality of sleep and reducing daytime symptoms. Medications, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, exercise, sleep restriction, time spent in bed, as well as other non-pharmacological interventions may be used alone or in combination. However, the use of hypnotic drugs for inssomnia is generally not recommended due to the lack of evidence of their effectiveness and potential adverse effects. In addition, withdrawal of these drugs may cause rebound insominia. Non-drug treatments have been shown to have long-term benefits and are currently the preferred treatment for persistent insomonica.11 Question. how does one taper off of gabentibe? what are the side affects of tapering? how do i know if i have a withdrawal? can i stop gabantibe cold turkey?", "At least theres no reason to act as if its in the same league as heroin, or meth, which are clearly mentioned later in this paragraph where its also stated that they are treated medically, as they should be, and that the patient is transferred to the emergency room, again, where they will be treated as needed. There must be some other drugs that are illicit that Gabapers may be mixed with, so the point is still relevant. Again, no disrespect is intended. It is just that this is not correct, not for this article and not in general. Question: 45,How do we stop a panic attack? \n ### Answer: If you feel your anxiety rising, slow your breathing and remind yourself that you are having a Panic Attack. Take a few moments to focus on your physical sensations, particularly your breath (both its frequency and sensation as it enters and leaves your body). This will help you to feel more grounded or centred. Keep talking to yourself in a gentle, reassuring manner. Ask a friend or family member to take you for a walk, get some fresh air, sit down and call your doctor or nurse from the clinic.1, 2 Take some time to think about a place that makes you happy, gives you a sense of peace, perhaps a safe place from when you were a child or a favorite holiday destination. Now think of the sights, sounds, feel, smells that make this place special to you. Visualize being there, the more sensory details you invoke the easier it will feel to get there. Remember it is okay to have panic attacks, many people suffer them and they can be effectively managed with medication and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. In emergency situations, panic buttons, \u201cloosies\u201d, or pre-prepared codes that automatically dial for help can minimize the distress associated with making for the phone during a attack, but usually the best strategy to avoid distress is to accept that such attacks are a part of your bipolar disorder and adopt ways of coping with them, including knowing that help is available.60 Question ### answer: It may also be useful to try and understand what may have triggered the attack. What was going on before it happened? Did you notice anything different in your surroundings (e.g., people\u2019s behaviour, sires in distance, busy traffic, etc.)?61 Question 16,What triggers a diab", "I see lots of controlled substances around but not Gabpentin.

(Or, if your piercings were done recently, apply oxybutynin to a bandaid and stick that on the ring.)If your skin has dark pigment, choose a drug with white or cream-colored oils or waxes. Test the medication on another area of the skin to check for allergic reactions before applying the drug to your niplerection.Wear dark clothing or cover the area with band-aid to avoid staining the material.Apply the recommended amount of medication (usually a small amount) to facilitate absorption though the thin skin of a nipless piering.In order to minimize the chance of getting undesired results, try to manipulate the nipled tissue as little as possible.Use scissors to carefully snip off any excess oily substance, which may clog the ducts of apocrine sweat glands on your chest. Remember that a little goes a long way with topicals.Rinse-off medications should be applied every day, ideally at about the same time every morning after showering and before deodorant or antiperspirant.Pat the SKINaSMOOTHa zone dry, rather than rubbing it, to reduce wetness and irritation.If you find that you're still producing excess sweat, consider using an over-the-counter anti-sweat product. We recommend products containing aluminum chloride. Try a product from a pharmacy or grocery store instead of an antiparticipant drug. Do not use an antiperipidal product such as Mitchum. Follow the directions in the product\u2019s reference booklet or on http://www.cdc.gov/cat to ensure correct use.Do not apply antisweating agents to pierceings or other injured or irritated skin. Avoid using antimicrobial agents or astringents because they may dry the already damaged skin, making it more susceptible to infection and slowing the wound-healing process.Be patient. Many mild irritants used to dry up excess skin moisture also inhibit the sweat duhracts from producing sweat and perspiring", "### Answer: If your navel is pierged, you can't pull the pier through the skin as the nabel is not pierge in one hole.

Echinocandins, an antimycotic class used in treating invasive fungal infections, are known to have hepatotoxic effects.This study presents the results of a tertiary care center\u2019s investigation into liver abnormalities occurring in patients who were treated with echino candins.The metabolic ability of the liver is impaired by any number of factors, including disease, alcohol consumption, and exposure to certain medications. As the primary metabiolic center in humans, it is responsible for the processing of approximately 3/4 of all drugs. Because of its role in metabolism, the effect of any medicine on the hepatic cells is difficult to predict . Hepatotocxicity is the potential for any drug to cause damage to liver cells. The extent of liver damage may range from a simple elevation of serum transaminase levels without jaudice to life-threatening acute heaptitis or chronic, irreversable cirrhosis.

Common colds are caused by a number of viri, the most common being coronaviruses, adenoviruse, rhinovirus, and influenza virus, all of which require human host cells to reproduce (Klimassen, 2014). In the case of SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-10, person-to-person contact results in exposure to droplets or aerosols harbouring the virus. It is then possible, albeit not necessarily, for the individual to become ill. In short, a person can be exposed to the Sars-Cov- 0 virus via person to person contact, via contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites), or by inhaling airborn droplet nuclei.Furthermore, while you can develop a mild illness from Covid that does not require medical attention, it nonetheless can cause a fever and cough, both of whom can spread the disease to others.

Question: 11,What is the treatment for otitis media in adults? \n ### Answer: There is currently no consensus on the best treatment of uncomplicated otal media. Antibiotics are not effective and should be reserved for patients with prolonged or worsening symptoms, or patients who are considered to be higher risk due to the presence of other health problems. There are a number of antimicrobial agents which have been used for the management of chronic otis media, with varying degrees of success. Among these are pneumococcal, macrolide and clindamycin antibioticas well as nasal, oral and intratympanic steroids.12 Question\n13,When is an abscess considered \u201clarge\u201d?A. When it measures more than 5 cm in diameter.B. In a patient with purulent otalgia, when bedside tests show negative results for hearing loss and tympanum perforation, an ear abcess is considered small.C. A tympanic abcss can be regarded as large when it extends within the mastoid or to adjacent structures such as the brain or spinal cord.D. All answers are incorrect14, When is it necessary to make a surgical incision for drainage in a typical case of tymptic abss?We should wait until the standard antibiotic treatment has been completed. Then we should observe it for a week. If it is slightly improved, it means that the abbess has a good potential for healing. However, if it does not improve at all, we have to open it.

Question ## Answer : What does it mean when your urine is dark? Is it just the colour of urin or is it a sign of something? Please explain more. If it is just a dark colour, it can be caused by many things, including exercise, fructose, and some medications. It can also be a symptom of dehydration, which is not good.

Herpes soresa are confined to the labial mucosa (tongue, soft palate, lip) and have been recognized with the typical stigma of HSV, which is a gray-white lesion surrounded by a yellowish-red circle. Also, recurrences are common in herpetic infections, and this is absent in cancers, although pain persists. Question: 4,How do i know its an empyema?\n9 Answer is there a way to differentiat it from other infection in fluid? or how do you confirm or something it is emypema. in my mind as long as there is fluid in the pleural cavity it does not matter if it has pus or not it's an infection.. what about bacterial? how can you tell form other bacteria? Question Answer. If you do a gram stain on a frozen sample it should distinguish pneumococcal from the other streptococcus (e.g. Group A, C and G) as they can have different findings on the gram. You also need to check for the presence of other common invaders such as S. aureus, H. influenzae., K. pneumaniae.. The presence pheonomena like guaic acid, white blood cells, glucose can help you differentiate whether it\u2019s embyema or just a collection of purulent fluid. But best way is to drain it and send it for culture and sensitivity. Gram stain can be done on undrained fluid as well. Empyema is an exudative pleurisy, where there has been a chemical reaction between the inflammatory elements and the albumin which has come from circulation; this reaction leads to a clear, colourless to yellow fluid accumulating in pleura; at the beginning of the reaction only a few WBC may be present but as the excretion of albumins continues they are gradually replaced by W BC and PMN. Therefore, while drainage of all fluid will certainly reduce the risk of pyaemia, whether or no the WCC and CMN counts are of any utility in predicting the need for drain evacuation is uncertain; further", "(SSS2)The difference between a cold sore and a herpetic lesion is that a viral sore (herpetica lesiona) recur in the same area (always), whereas, a bacterial sore or cancera lesions do not.Canker soresa appear suddenly and are usually red in colour, round or flattened, pain inflicting lesiones that occur on the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, lips, or in this case, on finger tips.The pain is intense, burning, stinging, and may cause food and liquid to the sensation of tasting like poison, which can result in swallowing difficulties.

Question : 28,I have ringworm of my body? ###answer: No, the medical term for ring worm of body is tinea corporis. It is caused a fungal infection, typically by one of three species of dermatophytes: Trichophyes mentagrophytes, Microsporum globose, or M. gypseum. Tinea corpus is characterized by the presence of ring-like lesions, usually 1 to 3 cm in diameter, on the skin. The lesations may be hypopigmented or hyperpigmnted with respect to adjacent skin, depressed, scaly, blister, purplish, red or hirsute. They are usually confined to a single plane, but may become bullous. In the case of doubt, always consult a physician or use antifungal cream, because the normal skin flora is also able to cause ring shaped lesion. For more accuracy, we take the specimen and examine it. If you bring the medicine, you can have more accurate description.In my program, every participant's ring was examined and all the data were recorded.The treatment of tina corpulis mostly depends on dong Seng (traditional medicine doctor) and the severity of disease. He usually prescribes proper food and medication. We take specimens from the lesioned area and send it for testing.If it is Tinami corrupus, they usually use ketoconazole or microgel for the treatment.

Long-term memory can take several months to return to pre-stress levels. However, in some individuals, amnesia can be permanent.10,Why did I have memory problems before menopause?There are several reasons why women may experience memory difficulties prior to men opause:Hormonal changes: As women age, estrogen levels fluctuate, causing brain chemical levels(neurotransmitters) to become unbalanced. This can affect learning and memory.Progesterone, which has a calming effect, may also be reduced, making women feel more anxious and jittery.Lack of sleep: Hormone changes and hot flashes can disrupt sleep, leaving women tired and fatigued during the day. Lack og sleep is a common cause of memory impairment.Stress: Managing work, family and children, along with other responsibilities", "Hearth Rate Variability (HRV) is the scientific term used to describe the inevitable variations in the interval between consecutive heart beats (heart rate, HR) that occur over a period of time. While this time variation in heart, can be measured in milliseconds, it reflects, among other things, respiratory and psychological rhythm. As well as being an indicator of physical fitness, HRR can reflect the autonomic tone present in individuals, this is known as power spectral analysis. However, these are two extremely different measurements: the one that reflects the variations within a range of 0.3\u20130,5 seconds and the other one the range that goes above 5seconds. For example, what happens with HRA is that the measure will be the average of all the inter-beat intervals of the heart. So, for example if you have 10 seconds of information in which the subject has 8 beeps of heart and 2 of them are skips, the HI will vary from 3.5 to 7second with an average measure that is 4.25 second. What HRVA does is to perform a statistical method in order to find the variability between the time in between two heart knocks and then try to relate this to information that can describe several circumstances as anxiety, fear, rage, pain, etc Question: Does a swelling in your brain go away? \n ### Answer: \u27a2Swelling will continue until the cause of symptoms is removed. Once the swollen area is reduced, damage to the brain may continue, especially if there is high pressure build-up in this area. Any residual swaging that remains after 6 months has been found to be permanent in 90% of cases. Questioning the \u201cP\u201d in ROP (Plus Disease) Question : When do symptoms of gout show themselves ? -------------------------- Answer \u2264 \u00d8 \u2265 \u00bd hour following a meal.The glycemic load of a preceding meal is a more important determinant of onset of acute gouts' symptoms than the amount of meat consumed. A vegetable-based diet appears to have a beneficial influence on the frequency of attacks and chronic complications.Acute attacks sometimes precede hyperuricemia and are present \u224880 of individuals with tophaceous disease.Often preceded by the consumption of food, particularly meat", "Hypothetically, you can have a very high HRR despite a fast heart beat if the heart is beating irregularly (\u201cirregular\u201d means not every beat is a heartbeat\u2014e.g. due to a problem with the pacemaker rhythm or due a delay in the electrical impulse after a premature beat). This is why some pacers will have high values of HBR even though their HR is controlled and very close to normal. Conversely, it is also possible to have slow heart beats that are regular slow bea,ts or irrep,e,t,ive or problem in conduction (this is called an escape beat) and therefore HRA will be high despite low HR. Question: 9,How long can a person live at early stages of Alzheimers? \n ### Answer: When is the best time to start AD medication? Which medical tests should be done before starting AD treatment? Can vitamins or other chemicals cure or slow the progression of AD? How much does the typical brain weigh? When do the effects of plaque build-up start?10, 15, How long does poor nutrition shorten dementia patients\u2019 life expectancy?When deferoxamine chelated iron, do you think it helps slow down the onset of nerve damage or slows the rate of progress of the nerve failure. Is this likely to give the same result as actually giving nerve nutrients such as vitamin E or CoQ1O?If you\u2019re 80 years old and have AD, and your brain has enough iron to last the 4\u20136 years it takes to die from this disease\u2013 what happens to the surplus iron once your nerve cells die?Does the iron cause the death of brain cells or does it simply hasten the decay? Question Answer :11,What happens at the molecular level in brain cell as AD progresses?A. Beta-amyloid plaques deposit outside brain nerve cell and then 2. Oxidative stresses spreads causing activation of microgloia and astrocytes leaving toxic environment which then causes 3. Neurofibrillary tangles to develop inside brain neurons.B. Exactly opposite sequence of events occurs \u2013 i.e., AD ends with neurofribrilliary tangle development and beta amylo deposits outside brains cells", "How are they related?Having a normal heart beat doesn't necessarily mean your autonomic system (which controls HRR) is functioning optimally. A person can have a regular, steady heartbeat, but if that beat is too slow or too fast, it means the autonomous system isn' t working properly. This is where HRA comes in. It assesses the health of the cardiac and metabolic systems by measuring heart rhythm, heart rates, and strength of heartbeats (among other measures). It gives you an idea of how well the Autonomic System is working, which is related (but different) from simply having a \u201cnormal\u201d heart beating pattern. Question: 4,What is myasthenia gravis a sleep disorder? \n ### Answer: Myastenia Gravis is a disorder that impacts the neuromuscular system, leading to fatigue and weakness in the muscles.

Question: what is arthritis of the knee?\n?  \n & Answer:-,-Arthrosis (= osteoarthritic knee) is characterized by chronic and usually painless restrictive alterations of knee function due to organic changes of mainly a mechanical nature, which partially compromise the articular cavities, ligamentous bonds, and meniscus. These alteration causes gradually narrow the amplitude of movement of joints, determining the limitations of their function.-,,-Arthur (from the Greek: artha, \u201cporosity\u201d or \u201cpore\u201d and -itis, inflammation) was first described by Hippocrates (460\u2013370 BC) as a progressive narrowing of articolucal cavites as consequence of rheumatic affection, thereby producing pain and limiting movements of affected joint. 51,What is chondromalacia?-As with all joint structures, the tissues of synovial joint are subject to degenerative changes as result of ageing, injury, or malfunction. Chondramalecia is a condition affecting the hyaline artilage which lines the cavity of capsule in synoveialjoint. The synoviocil layer becomes rough and results in cartilaginous erosion with oseticfication at its surface. Articular cartliage was impaired due otaiccumulation of blood and synivial fluid. Synovitis induces alteraions in capillary permeability and produces a gradual increase in mobility and finally inability of terminal joint function.2,52 Question The first symptoms of carcinoid syndrome are typically a combination of:Flushing of face, neck, chest, arms, legs, abdomen,or even whole bodyTingling and stinging sensation in fingers and toesDiarrhea, especially after eating (the \"meal-related\" type of diarrhoea)Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose)Skin lesions and bouts of rednessEasy blushingPalpitations (feeling like your heart is racing)Wheezing/Breathing difficultiesAnxious/Nervous feelingStaggeringEpisodes of fainting (loss of consciousness)"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5645, "rouge1_r": 0.1378, "rouge1_f1": 0.2215, "rouge2_p": 0.1475, "rouge2_r": 0.0356, "rouge2_f1": 0.0573, "rougel_p": 0.3065, "rougel_r": 0.0748, "rougel_f1": 0.1203, "bleurt": 0.2879, "bert_score_p": 0.7579, "bert_score_r": 0.8523, "bert_score_f1": 0.8023, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1827}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4839, "rouge1_r": 0.0831, "rouge1_f1": 0.1418, "rouge2_p": 0.1311, "rouge2_r": 0.0222, "rouge2_f1": 0.038, "rougel_p": 0.3387, "rougel_r": 0.0582, "rougel_f1": 0.0993, "bleurt": 0.2985, "bert_score_p": 0.7824, "bert_score_r": 0.8521, "bert_score_f1": 0.8158, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1252}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.6452, "rouge1_r": 0.1105, "rouge1_f1": 0.1887, "rouge2_p": 0.1967, "rouge2_r": 0.0332, "rouge2_f1": 0.0569, "rougel_p": 0.3548, "rougel_r": 0.0608, "rougel_f1": 0.1038, "bleurt": 0.2497, "bert_score_p": 0.793, "bert_score_r": 0.8704, "bert_score_f1": 0.8299, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1383}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4839, "rouge1_r": 0.0843, "rouge1_f1": 0.1435, "rouge2_p": 0.0492, "rouge2_r": 0.0085, "rouge2_f1": 0.0144, "rougel_p": 0.2742, "rougel_r": 0.0478, "rougel_f1": 0.0813, "bleurt": 0.3106, "bert_score_p": 0.7783, "bert_score_r": 0.8213, "bert_score_f1": 0.7992, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1276}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4194, "rouge1_r": 0.089, "rouge1_f1": 0.1469, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.2742, "rougel_r": 0.0582, "rougel_f1": 0.096, "bleurt": 0.2874, "bert_score_p": 0.7716, "bert_score_r": 0.8254, "bert_score_f1": 0.7976, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1377}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3871, "rouge1_r": 0.0902, "rouge1_f1": 0.1463, "rouge2_p": 0.0164, "rouge2_r": 0.0038, "rouge2_f1": 0.0061, "rougel_p": 0.2419, "rougel_r": 0.0564, "rougel_f1": 0.0915, "bleurt": 0.2487, "bert_score_p": 0.7595, "bert_score_r": 0.804, "bert_score_f1": 0.7811, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1281}]}

Question: 3,How is pilonidal sinus different from cyst? \n ### Answer: Pilonial sinuses are hair-bearing Sacrificing 1 cm wide wound channels in the skin, whereas csts are not. PSD is mainly located in natal cleft (85%) and are rare in other areas like forehead, nape, axilla, groin, or tinea pedis. PS is a condition in which the hair follicle is not properly developed and ends in an epithelial filled canal or sinu instead of a hair root. These hairs become trapped in this sinuit and form a sinuous tract. It is more commonly seen in younger patients (65% between the ages of 9 and 40 years) and is less common in older patients .Pilonidial Sinus is the name of an abnormal tunnel-shaped cavity in, under,or on the surface of skin. A sinucular tract filled with hair and exudate is usually found leading to a broken skin surface, where hair from deep tissues, has grown through and become caught at the broken surface .Cyst: Cyst is an interdermal or subdermial sac, filled whith liquid, air or solid (sebaceous, mucus) .Most skin cysst are benign (95 %), However about 5-10 % of cansiderable morphologic diversity are known , Question Answers (N=227): 8 74,5 68,786,6 011  What is pyoderma gangrenosum?75,Pyoderama gangreosums is necrotizing vasculitis that primarily affects the mcburnry and the extensor surfaces of thr joints, but may also involve", "### Answer: PIDs are treated by management of the underlying condition, vaccination, and prevention of acute episodes.

Question: When should the vaccines be given?\n?  \n ## Answer 6,11,What is the difference between a vaccine and a serum?The difference is that a vaccinethat is, something that induc es immunity, while aserum, such as the blood serumsupports or carries immune cells or molecules.So, a combination of achemicals in a preparation that induces antibody protection is called avaccine. And when this preparation is obtained from a diseased person or animal, it iscalleda serume.Goghina et al. 8,When should I take my malaria prevention medication?Prevention medication is usually taken within 1 to 2 days before the expedition and for at least 4 weeks after returning, depending on the type of drug prescribed. It is advised to continue with the full course of treatment even if you feel better or have symptoms of malarial parasites. If you forget to take your medication, do not wait for the next scheduled dose; take it as soon as you remember and continue the doses for that day. Do NOT take a double dose. Ask your health care provider or refer to your medicine label if in doubt. Malaria preventive medication should be taken together with food as this reduces stomach upsets.Take medicine with lot of water if feels dry.9,Should I stop my normal medication when taking Malafob?You can NOT reduce or stop taking ultraviolet light (UV) protectivesuch as sunshcreens or tanning lotions and creams when using Malavir.10,Is Malvir suitable for children?Yes, Malondu is suitable and safe for use in children as young as 5 years of age. The age limit is 70 years for adults. However, children below 9 years require twice the adult dosage. Refer to the package insert for further guidance.It is important to follow the recommended dosing schedule and not to adjust the dose based on your own judgement.Malaviyo has a slight (less than 30%) reduction rate during storage under refrigeration at -20\u00b0C and in the product packaging. Keep out of direct sunlight as photo-", "There is no cure for PIDs. Treatment aims to minimize symptoms and prevent complications through long-term care and monitoring. This may include medicines to relieve pain, correct hormone deficiencies, and reduce inflammation. Patients and caregivers are trained in self-care to help manage the condition at home. In some cases, surgery may be recommended. Lifelong, Individualized Medical Care Is Needed To Survive and Thrive. Question: 82,What increases your risk of developing carcinoid syndrome? \n ### Answer: A Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms derived from cells that have the ability to produce and secrete various hormones and neurotransmitters. These NETs can develop in different locations and affect different parts of the body. The incidence of NET increases with age, mostly affecting people over 60 years old, with a slight prevalence among men. NET is very rare, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers.95The risk factors for developing NET are still unknown. However, exposure to certain chemical compounds (such as pesticides, insecticides and ionizing radiation) and certain genetic conditions (eg. Von Willebrand disease) may increase the risk. A family history of cancer may also be a risk factor.4,9,46,80 Question. 91,10 0,Do you know what happens in Carcinoids?(in English) https://youtu.be/85MtUkZlKG4 [YOUTUBE]45,77,59Do patients receive notice of diagnosis prior to chemotherapy and what are their options for receiving second opinion?127.511.61429.062.2Is there a system in place to control over-diagnosis and overtreatment of Carcino?94.766.167192218.8How big will my tumor be by the end of chemo if I start with 2 cm tumour and have my first MRI on day 7 of treatment?7813.3170.### Answer 5. What happens if carcinaoid crisis is not treated appropriately?44156358", "### Answer: In severe cases, where there is suspicion of a malignant cause, the patient needs to be started on cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the case of lymphoma or leukemia, standard chemotherapies are used, and for solid tumors, chemography is usually combined with radiation therapy. It is important to remember that PIDs are caused by a deficiency in the immune system, so strengthening the existing immune response through vaccinations or antibodies against infections is also important in managing these patients [6, 85]. Question: 69,What is the best treatment for angioedema?\n? Answer these questions before and after the session. Question ### answer: Please give us more accurate information about angioneurotic edema. Why does Quincke edeme look like a cuff around the eye? Please explain. For an accurate diagnosis, we need the clinical history of the patients. I think this article has some deficiencies in this part. Please revise it. The most important point is accurate history taking. Without the proper history, an incorrect diagnosis can easily be made. That is why we give more emphasis on history in our curriculum. We have to touch upon the subject of history not only for anatomical reasons but also pathophysiological. Regarding the treatment, I have two remarks. First, regarding C1 inhibitor, there are two types of treatment: on-demand and prophylaxis. This point needs more elaboration and is essential for the take-home message. Second, please emphasize more on the side effects of ACE inhibitors because this is an essential point for patients who are already taking Ace inhibitior for other reasons. Sodium chloride, lithium, alprazolam and other medications may interact negatively with Acel inhibiors. Therefore, caution should be exercised and maybe highlighted more in red boxes.

Trazodne is usually taken as a single dose at bedtime. If you have trouble sleeping, your doctor may have you try trazedone for a few nights. Question 2,How is Zolpidem PB used? Question\n3,What is the recommended dose of Zopiclone? The recommended initial dose is 3.75 mg at bedsight. The maximum dose recommended is of 7.5 or 9 mg. Zoplicone is to used on a daily basis. (Zopiclon is used in the treatment of insomnia. Its action is initiated within 60 to 80 minutes after intake and it reaches a peak at 0.8 to two hours after ingestion. 50% of the drug is excreted in urine and erythrocytes within a week. About \u00bc of it remains in body after \u00bd life of about \u223d  hour. No major interactions with food were reported. However, alcohol may increase the sedative effect of zopicone. Elderly patients should avoid alcohol while taking zolpicon. Side effects of this drug include morning hangover, drowsiness, impaired coordination, and increased risk of falls in elderly patients. Other side effects include headache, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, nausea vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, heartburn, eructation and other gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness, fatigue, weakness, blurred vision, photophobia, pruritus, urticaria, paresthesia and hypersensitivity reactions.

It is approved in many countries around the world and has been included in the World Health Organization's (WHO) essential medicine list (Mattson 2014, Liu 1+ 3 \u25b3\u25ce, Haj 4 ### answer: It has different brand name: Eulipid in China, Selonsert in Russia, etc. The mechanism, indication, efficacy, and safety of Oz are basically the same as lira. When lyrica is used to treat other diseases, it must be liritapid. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the chemistry, pharmacology, preclinical studies, clinical trials and recent advances of lirtaglu,tide.Pharmacokinetics: Liraguide is not a native human protein, having homology with 58% of human GLP-1. This can result in unwanted binding to GLp-receptors present in other organs and tissues, for example cardiac GL3- receptators. Moreover, the half-life is relatively long (approximately 80 minutes) compared to other GL1-like receptor agonsit (which have half lives of approximately 90 seconds to 7 minutes). In human, GLB-induced insulin secretion remains unaffected after 6 months of treatment, while in animal studies increased insuin secretory response is reported even after long-term administration of Glba.Long-acting GLb rector agnots like lita guide can give three times higher insulino secretori response compared with short-acring GLba agnosts. For instance, in humans, a single infusion of 0.02 mg/kg bw of Lira causes an increase in serum insula \u223c8 \u00ecU/mL, approximately five times greater than that induced by a \ud835\udf07 UD of regular human inslina [18, ].Molecular structure, chemical properties and molecular formula: lirusumtida (also called l", "### Answer: I have heard that Ozumpic is a longer acting GLP-1 RA and Saxenda is shorter lived and perhaps easier to take but has to be taken daily.

I would suggest to rephrase as \"How can babies get the disease?\"", "### Answer: Ozmpic and Saxenda are both GLP-1 receptor agonists. They share the same brand name (Bydureon) and many similarities in their effects on glycemic control. The differences between them can be found in the formulation, dosing, and some aspects of their pharmacokinetic properties. Saxendan, approved by FDA is a once-daily injection, available in pre-filled dosage box with a pen, which allows accurate doses between 0.1 and 2 mg. Ozempic, on the other hand, comes in a prefilled disposable pen containing 1.5 mg for use up to twice daily Ozendas is approved in Europe as a twice-a-day injection. In terms of pharmocokineics, Saxendoa has the longest half-life of any GLPG-R agona, between the twice a day Ozenda and once a month Levea. Based on its half life, it is expected that the effect of Saxena would last for at least two days. Unlike Leversa, no discontinuation symptoms have been reported with Saxeandao (by some Levera users); this could be related to its longer half -life and flatter, longer-acting pharmaco-kinetic profile as compared to Leversea (which has a half like of 7.2hours).

Oz has FDA approval based on two clinical trials demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction compared with placebo in patients with underlying cardio-metabolic conditions (when adjusting for statistical power to detect differences in CV outcomes, the number of patients in these two trials is similar to the 3345 patients enrolled in our trial). Saxenda was approved by the Fda basedon trials that focused on glycemic and weight reduction. Question: Is it ok to take fluorouracil and capecitabine at the same time?\n?

In most cases, shing spls are transient, but they can become chronic if the underlying cause is not addressed. It is important to identify and address any underlying causes, such as excessive pronation, in order to prevent chronic shings spl ints. Question: What do the scars look like on a baby?\n?  \n### Answer 1.A scar is a scar, whether on an adult or a child. The colour, texture and size vary according to: \u2022 the type of injury \u2022 how long ago it happened \u2022 and the rate of scar maturity.On the leg of a one year old baby/toddler, the scar (2 \u00d7 8 cm) is red in colour and is raised and scabby above the cloth line. With age, it will flatten down and become more elastic.Older children and adults will have a darker scar which will also be raised above cloth lines. (A child will often have little or no hair on their legs)This picture shows the healing progress of wounds of different sizes. Healing by granulation (the new tissue that comes from the edge of wound) and later maturing into a line of skin that is harder and lighter in comparison to the original skin tone. As the wound heals, new blood vessels form under the skin helping to give it the pink hue. Some larger wounds may take an Year or more to heal completely.Healing of injuries to face and scalp areas will give different results.The rate at which a wound (or scald mark) healed depends on many factors, including the location and depth of burn, as well as the size of damage, and whether or not there is any infection. If there are blisters, oozing and/or redness in the acute phase (first 24\u201372 h), and these persist for more than 5 days, there may be an infection, which must be treated with antibiotics.During the maturation phase, skin may become dark red, brownish, white or puckered at the injury site during scar formation, depending upon the depth and nature of underlying tissue affected. This process may continue for a few months. At completion, scar tissue may, or may not, resemble surrounding skin.This is the stage that determines", "### Answer: 73,76,932.18 (0.94)9.3 (6.6\u201313.7)336How long does a case of pinched nerve take to heal?2239012 (7.5\u201324.2)577 496 21.8 171 Question: What are the home remedies for shingles prevention?\n? Question ### answer: It seems that one of the prevention techniques is to keep the immune system healthy by regular exercise, enough sleep, and a healthy diet, in addition to the vaccine. Can you please elaborate on these remedy techniques? Are there any other remodies that can help boost the innate and adaptive immunity to prevent shings? Do certain foods, for example, contain immune boosting vitamins? Can taking vitamin supplements help prevent the formation of shinge\u2019s rash? How can the stress level be lowered to aid in prevention of this disease? Please explain more about these aspects. In addition, can one become hypersensitive to light while having shingle\u2019 rashes? If so, how long can this sensitivity last for? This hypo sensitivity to bright light can also be considered as a kind of \u201clight allergy\u201d.

How severe is the damage to cells? Is it moderate or intense? Severe damage leading to scarring or hyperpigmentation is not desirable whereas a moderate damage and/or inflammation are preferred since they result in a stronger immune response and thus a faster healing and prevention.

It can also prevent the spread of the virus to others, especially to those who are more vulnerable, such as young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. The vaccine can reduce the severity of symptoms if you do get sick.It is recommended that everyone 9 years of age and older get a flu vaccine every year.

Influenza diseases have an incidence period between 1 and 3 days with a more pronounced peak around 2\u20133 . Question: Is 63\u00b0C a high fever?\n?  \n### Answer46,67I don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s a disease. Question, Is a fever above 40.6\u00b0 considered high? I think most people would agree that this represents a relatively high body temperature. 88 But if we want precise and accurate advice based on solid evidence then we need to use a figure that represents the highest percentage of cases in which the offending micro-organism is likely to be present or replete. Unfortunately, no such evidence base exists, so we are forced to take a consensus view, probably based around the opinion of the room at the time. As consensus it will be, the evidence is not likely refutable. However, I hope this review will stimulate interest in obtaining the data required to prove one or other opinion. If my own opinion is correct, and a significantly higher temperature will make the diagnosis more certain, then so much the better; if not then it would seem my opinion and that of Professor Wakefield are wrong. But, if above a certain temperature the causative agent(s) will either no longer be viable or numbers will have dropped to the point where recovery is probable despite inappropriate treatment then using a higher fever threshold for diagnosis will save lives, or at least prevent the need for unnecessary antibiotics.

Will taking ibuprofen and melonicam together increase the pain killing ability? How is this compared with taking both by themselves? Can it be additive? Or is there some form of inhibition? Would this be an antagonistic response? The pharmacology says it's a competitive inhibitor (which should result in reduced efficacy when both are present), however, this is a reversibly bound substrate, is it not? So, would not the overall effect be a reduction in the number of available active sites over time, eventually reaching a new plateau of lower overall effeicay? Could the authors comment on this?

The varusavirus causes both chicken cancer and human chicken. p Question, 00,Why did I get a cold after getting the flu shot? There was a virus that the vaccine was intended to trigger an immune response against. My immune system is overwhelmed with that viruses, that it cannot handle additional viral infections, like the common cold. Because my immune is stimulated already with one virus, my body reacts like it would when getting a flu that is much lighter than the one caused just by influenza. What I mean with this is that, normally, flu symptoms last a week or two, with some symptoms, such as coughing, possibly lasting a little longer than that. However, when, for example just influent virus is involved, everything ends up quickly. On the other hand, there are also vaccinations that do not cause a full response by themselves, but when a real infection comes along, they make it much more severe. This would be similar to the situation, where after the influenced vaccination, a person gets a much stronger and also longer lasting common viruse infection than necessary in a normal situation. For some reason, which I do understand well, at least the fact that a viruce vaccine is available, makes me feel a lot safer.

What if I feel sick after taking the antimicrobial, do I stop taking it? Question: I just returned from a month long stay in the Amazonian region of Peru. In the Peruvian amazon it's called \u201cBarrio Amazonas\u201d by the locals, because it borders the actual rain forest, which is regarded as too dangerous to habitation by most people. While I was in Barrio amazenas, I heard many stories from locals and other travellers about malarials in that region. The majority of cases were described as occurring in dark, damp forests in flooded areas, mostly at night. If this is true, it may help to narrow down the transmission cycle, if so, this information could be helpful in eventually finding a cure for this \u201cdeadly\u201d disease. Are the patients at high risk because they are hunters or farm workers, or is it due to travel through the forest by boat or on foot? Is the mosqito that bites them an \u201coutside\u201d moskito or one that finds its way into dwellings? Does malarity still occur if one sleeps under an mosquiry net? These are just a few of the questions that occurred to me while listening to the stories of others who fell victim to malarias in this region! The only way I see that these and many other questions could possibly be answered would be to interview the victims themselves, but this obviously would not be possible in most cases. I do hope that someone, preferably one of you experts, would continue to investigate this matter and gather as much data as possible, so that in time effective counter measures could eventually be developed. Thank you for your time and patience!

Question Answer 2,How to wean off of hydrochlorothiazide?\n?  \n### Answer Question 3,What is the difference between hydrolyzide and hydroclorothizide\n ? Answer Hydrolysate is a generic name of a group of compounds that are formed by the action of water on a parent substance. Hydrolase is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of one or more water molecules to a substance, forming a soluble product. In the case of thiazides, the parent compound is diuretic, and the hydrolases are enriched in the kidney. The active principle of the diuresis is hydrogen thiocyanate, which is formed from the thione (or thiol) form of dihydropyrimidine. When the compound enters the bloodstream, it is in equilibrium with its ionized form, hydrocyanic acid. This is excreted in urine, mainly by glomerular filtration, with little or no reabsorption. Thus, thiacetazone is one of several hydrazine derivatives that have been used as diUREtics. Other examples are thioacetamide, S-acetyltriazoline, sulfapyridine and triamponium. All these componds are ionizable and act as weak acids. They are exreted by both glomeular fiter and tubular secretion. Thiocarbamides are also exretaed mainly in their ionised form. Ionised hydrocarbonamidothione is also found in human urin. Some of these thiones are converted to their dithione forms, e.g. dicyanam ide. Dicyandiamide is used in agriculture as a fungicide. It is ionis ed and exreated by kidneys. Its anionic form is dianionium, found mainlyin ur", "Would it just help the symptoms? Also, what is benadryl (diphenhydramine).

Question : are peppermint oils safe to use? \n## Answer : p/nsno nsn/a Question-What do steroids do to the human body?\n\nQ: steroid is made in the adrenal glands. There are three types of sterroid. The most important ones are glucocorticoids, mineralococrtiolds, and androgen. Q: androstenedione is what? what gland make it? is it steriod or hormone? Q-androstenedion is usually present in more than one glean, so it\u2019s not so glorified to be called a grael. As the sterid hormones are usually metabolites/bioproducts of enzymatic reactions/processes, the role of each gael in those processes should also be gustified/proveid. In other words, gt is crucia to determine if a certain ganel in a 3D scan is really the ganele responsible for a certian gsteroid production?

Is it not possible that the anti histamine is helping with the symptoms? If so, maybe replace it with an anti Histamine that does not have sedating effects? Is there a non drowsy equivalent of claritromxine? Question: does loratidine help with nasal itching? \n ### Answer: Loratadine helps with allergic rhinitis by preventing the binding of allergens to receptors on mast cells in the nose and elsewhere in body. We don\u2019t have research evidence specifically on how loration works in terms of relieving itches, however, it is a histamin blocker and histamines are known to be one cause of itcheing. So, we presume that lora would show some degree of efficacy in reducing itches in allergies and especially the eyes where histmines can cause itiches. Question : do the sedative effects go away?\n?  \n### Answer - Yes, the soporific (sleep-inducing) effect of triclofos does dissipate with time, although there are individual variations . Question- do you still get the \u2018crackling\u2019 sound if you crush the peppermint leaf buds? And does the oil still come out? Or is the sound made when you grind the leaf fragments against each other? Because if your goal is to make it easier to use, that\u2019s different from making an extract; you already have the essential oil, so your objective is different. It seems to me that for some reason the crackling sound is important. You might want to look into that in connection with your rationale for your invention. For extracts, a maceration or infusion is used, which means the material is actually soaked in oil or water, and then filtered, i.e., the process is continuous. In the case of pesto, there is no soaking or filtering, just grinding. Therefore to some extent the oils are still trapped in bolus in their matrix. I assume the maceral remains absorb the force of the blade and thus generate the sounds you described. With a dry powder there would likely be more friction between the particles, possibly accounting for the \u201ccrunch\u201d you hear,", "### Answer: Does hydrocortizone reduce the risk of a skin infection developing in poison ivy?

I don\u2019t know what it is about blood tests that I fear so much. It could be the needle, the fact that the blood is taken, or the whole procedure. Whatever it was, I was determined to overcome my fear and get the test done.I did some research and found out that there are other options to having the traditional blood test. There is a test called the Dry Needle Test, which uses a special device to collect the sample of blood. This test is not as widely available as the regular blood draw, but it does offer a painless option for those who are afraid of the standard blood collection method.After doing some more research, my husband and I found a doctor in our area who offers the dry needle test for thyroxine levels. We made an appointment, and on the day of our appointment I had to remind myself why I wanted to do this test instead of just getting it done the usual way.When we arrived at the doctor\u2019s office, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who took us back to the exam room. The doctor came in and explained the procedure to us. He told us that he would be using a device called a Tenderbar to draw the Blood. At this point, both my daughter and husband started to get a little nervous. My daughter started asking me questions about what to expect and what if it hurt. She was trying to convince herself that it would not be that bad. After a few minutes, he came back in with the Tanderbar and started the process.It was over in no time. In fact, it wasn\u2019 t even as bad as getting a blood glucose test at home with a lancet. That was the one thing I always disliked about those tests, they hurt! This was so quick and painlessly that my first thought was that they had made a mistake and they needed to come in here and do it again. But, this time I mustered up the courage to ask the Doctor if that was all there was to it.He told me that most of time that is all that\u2019 s needed.

Question: 4,Is the loss of smell and taste serious? \n ### Answer: The smell loss is very serious. The patient will lose the sense of taste as a consequence.

Smell is important for us to recognize most things we eat. There are about 10,001 smell receptors in the nose, but only 2 in most of our taste buds. But the receptor for carbon dioxide (CO2) which can be found in all taste cells. So, if our sense CO2 by smells different, we also have difficulty in tasting. Many people don\u2019t know that CO exhales carbon (IV) and that we can taste CO (by the way it is not good for health to taste). We must use H2SO4 to be able to detect CO in dark and cold as described in a book written by Pauling and the Nobel Prize winner Linus Paulin.

Question: 6,Are cold sores caused by the flu? \n ### Answer: There is a belief that cold sore outbreaks are triggered by flu. This is not true. Cold soores are caused herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, while influenza is caused an a virus from the Orthomyxoviridae family. However, a number of studies have shown that stress, fever and allergies can trigger or exacerbate cold-sore symptoms. 7,What has a black and blue tip but is still a coldore? A pencil with black lead and a blue point.8,Why are cold spores contagious? The virus can survive outside the body for several weeks under favorable conditions, such as cool temperatures. Therefore, it can easily spread through physical contact with infected soars.9,Can cold spray be used for treatment? There are some studies that suggest that spraying the lesions with Lactinex spray could reduce the duration of the outbreak. Lactic acid inhibits the growth of herpetic viruses.10,When do cold scores usually erupt? Cold sore usually develop within the first 48 h after exposure to the triggering factor. The vesicles generally crust within 8\u201312 days. When a blister breaks, the fluid it contains is clear and sometimes yellowish. It then dries out and the scab falls off.The scabs heal without leaving any permanent scar. In some cases, however, particularly in people with weakened immune systems, complicated lesion may develop and leave deep scars that never heal.These complicated sore can also occur in previously healthy persons who are otherwise not familiar with cold saor. Such soares may be the initial sign of a developing illness, and may occur anywhere on the face, hand or arms, sometimes in conjunction with irregular lesios in other organs. If this situation is recognized early any proper treatment may terminate the illness with no after effects. But if not, these cases can result in severe illness and death.

Question. how to treat oedema?\n? : CCB and/or hydrochlorothiazide should be used in hypertensive patients with OHT to improve ocular inflow. Ocular perfusion pressures may be increased by increasing regional perfusive pressurs using either pharmacological or surgical means. Intraocular pressure can also be reduced by relieving any compressive effects on the globe. Some authorities recommend decompressing the orbital contents in the treatment of Grave's ophthalmopathy and some sub-fusional decompression procedures have been described. Other treatments including intravenous steroids, ice packs and elevation of the head of bed  are short-lived and have no long-lasting effect in OG. Orbital radiation is indicated in patients who do not respond to other treatments. Various surgcial procedures such as adjusting or trimming the extraocullar muscles, silicone implant insertion  and use of Botulinin toxin injections  have also been advocated. The results of treatments used are often variable and the indications for use are still uncertain. A better understanding of any underlying immunological mechanism may help in devising more targeted and effective therapies in due course.

Would it be considered unsafe to drink an alcoholic beverage with the trajodode? My pdoc told me not to but did not explain why. Question: can u take amoxicillin with metoprolol?\n?\u2013The purpose of the study is to assess whether metoclopramide (a compound known to increase gastric acidity and whose long-term or high-dose use is associated with hypergastric conditions and erosive gastrastritis) could counteract the anti-secretory action of amoxycicline, which might represent a safety concern, since acid suppression would make it easier to develop gas- and ulcer-related adverse events when used with amlodipine, an antihypertensive drug whose use in patients on long term proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapy is not recommended. The drug-to- drug interaction was not relevant since the gas trancdients were not changed. If the patient feels better, we do not change the antibiotic. It is important to follow the prescription.If patient feel bad, then the doctor also feels that prescription should be changed, this means that doctor is also using scientific method to treat patients. In this case, it is better to switch to another class of antibiotics because of patient tolerance but also because in this way, antibiatics resistance will also be delayed.In my opinion, the drug abuse is one of big reason of drug resistance recently.Many people feel better by using amphetamine or other stimulants; many people think that the use of such drug make them feel more active and better.However, many of them will not feel well after stop using those drugs. At that time, they will feel worse than before and this kind of people are easy to relapse. Therefore, if they only use antibotics after they feel very bad , the effect will only last for a period of time and when they get out of this situation They will easily use ampehtamine again. However, If they use stimulative drugs and antibotic as a substitute , they can stay away from ampthetaimine for long time.At last, I", "### Answer: I would like to know what others have tried and what other options I have.

Question answer: What does benazepine look like?  \n * Answer benzodiazepines bind to a specific site on a protein called the GABAA receptor, which is found mainly in brain cells. Binding the benzo causes the receptors to open, allowing negatively charged chloride ions to enter. This makes the neurons (nerve cells) calm down, and the overall effect is a sedative one. The different types of benza only differ slightly in how they bind the protein; but at the doses used in medicine, this bond is highly specific and, with very few exceptions, cannot be mistaken for any other. It just so happens that, because the chemicals vary (as with the groups of flurazepsam and triazolobenzodiazeines, or the group of \u03b1-1-phenylethyl-\u03b2-hydroxybenzimidazones, such as pentobarbitone or pentamine), different benzas will be detected at different rates in blood or urine, even if they have all been produced by the metabolism of some original drug of excess; and this means that a benzoneline test will not be able to give a result for them unless these groups are specified.31, 33,34 Question and Answer Question 04: how do you stop using marijuana?

The immediate release of mediaters leads to the early symptoms which occur within few minutes to an hour after exposure. Allergic reactions may also occur 4-8hrs after the exposure & are considered late allergies. Early symptoms are typically mild and may progress after continued exposure-redness, chills, and weakness. Late or long-term effects which can continue for days or even weeks after a single exposure include respiratory difficulties, fatigue, nausea & vomiting", "### Answer: The authors state that if the pain continues without exercise, then it should be a concern.

Question 02,Why do I have a metallic taste in my mouth? ### answer: Is it possible that the taste of the metal is caused by the presence of bacteria in the mouth, and that these bacteria are responsible for the production of hydrogen peroxide? If so, then the use of antibacterial mouthwashes may be effective. However, it is important to note that metallin taste is not the same as the actual presence metal in mouth. It is more likely a change in taste receptors that causes the perception of a particular taste, in this case, a taste that is associated with metals. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of metalline taste. In the meantime, if the metallinc taste bothers the individual, they can try to alleviate the symptoms by using a mouthwash that has been shown to be helpful in reducing the occurrence of this taste disturbance.03 Question. 51,Will a sore throat go down in a week?### Answer Yes, most sore throats will resolve in 7 days.

If you are receiving a worker\u2019s compensation, this test is very important as it will determine if you receive a permanent disability. Question 5: What does a bulging disc indicate?\n?  \n ## Answer 34,I would be more curious if there is a correlation to symptoms than just finding out it is bulge or no bulges. We all have bulgy discs, that is what ageing does to us. Does a spinal strain caused by the prolapse have different implications than a disc that has aged with the body or is that all in the mind?I was more interested in whether the information (anatomy lessons) regarding bulged disc would have a positive or negative effect (placebo) on the recipient than in actually having the bulga treated (which would eventually happen most likely for persistent pain \u2013 decompressive surgery). Question6: Why do I need to have an Xray if I feel fine?You recommend an evaluation by either a physiotherapist or chiroidoctor. I just want to know if it would help to relieve my lower back pain if nothing is showing up on Mri? Why is an xray not enough? I know the insurance companies want a certain amount of time to pass before MCI reasons for pain are valid. However, I really don't understand and wonder about the risk of radiation for an Mrialways. Thank youPatient Question7: How much space do you need on mri for compression? You say it\u2018s related to the patient\u2019sthe symptoms. How could I possibly know that from anMRI?

Pain, swelling, and muscle weakness are common symptoms. The grade of a strain varies from mild to severe, depending on the extent of the damage. Question the patient to clarify the site of pain and then palpate the area looking for signs of swollen, tender flesh which would be suggestive of an acute muscle tear. If you have any concerns or if it is a new injury the best course of action would always be referral to a health professional- either yourGP or physiotherapist for assessment and imaging if required. However, if the clinician is happy that there is no accele ration needed and that the injury is minor (this is advisable before returning to play in sport) then advice as follows may be given: Rest, ice, compress and elevate injured area. Advise over the counter anti-inflammatory e.g. ibuprofen, but reassure patient that swilling and icing is more beneficial.14 Tell patient not to return to sport until they are pain free, no swell and a full range of movement. Return to Sport Guidelines: A patient friendly guide to returning after a sporting injury. 5,Tell me about your injury, what happened? How did you hurt yourself? Why did it happen? Please specify the type of muscle and explain the mechanism of insult, for example a hamstring strain during high-speed running when the muscles were put to use beyond their optimal length, power, or the direction of force is opposed to them etc.4,This is something I learnt the hard way from my physio. I used to stretch my hamstrings as much as I could to make them more flexible but I was never allowed to and this guide explains why not. By stretching the hamSTRING you are actually WEAKENING your hamString. It makes no phys iological sense and I wish someone had told me that! (IDI18) \u201cIn fact it was a bit of both I would say. Not really a tear but more of like a twitch I think. Like when you go to lift something heavy and you get that feeling", "### Answer: Pain may last a few days or longer. Pain in the abdomen could be a symptom of a serious illness, so I would urge you to return if the discomfort persists for more than a week or if accompanied by high fever, weight loss, or trouble urinating. The pain might subside and then suddenly intensify again. Question: What is the life expectancy of someone with aortic stenosis?\n?87,What is a comparison between balloon valvuloplasty and surgery in terms of the outcomes in patients with AS? A few trials which compared the effects between the two modalities have indicated the superiority of surgical therapy in outcome such as symptoman relief as well as in mortality, However, these trials are relatively old and small in scale, So the conclusive evidence is still lacked at present, but it is obvious that the surgcial therapy provides us a definite benefit in higher mean gradient decrease and lower recurrence rate compared to the Balloon Valvuoplastry.The references which were used in this section were given as follows: 9,The original research article about the meta-analysis was as follow: Moinian J et al.

During the inspection, the pen should show the following characteristics. The glass vial that contains the liquid insulina glp-1 receptor agonist should be equipped with an absorbent pad that is sufficient for the required number single dosages of glibenclamide.(Basal rate) There should also be a dose setting for basal rates such as -1, -2, and -4. This test should check whether the pre-set basel rate can be administered for at least 7 days.(Continuous rate/square meal) Continuous rates of 2.5, 4, or 6 U/h are possible. Since the re-formulated rapid-acting insula glq-pa pen glb (analogue to our old fast-mixed insua gll in the yellow pen) comes in a set of five dosage units of, e.g., 100 U, it allows us to simulate the continuous rate of rapid acting insular analogues up to 8 U per h.For the square", "and can it is measured in urine or blood.and what is urea?is it normal to smell ur to detect ureal?i will see a doctor once detecting the high blood creatine .

The treatment usually involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for retina migratory artery. Surgery is used in some cases to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy is usually reserved for cases that are resistant to chem therapy or that have recurred after chem and surgery. In some case, anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs can be helpful. It is also important to note that these drugs are most effective when used early in treatment.

CTP: What is the therapeutic or pharmacological effect of CTF?In your text CORRELATION is written instead of correlation. I assume it is accidental. If you mean correlation then what is negative or positive correlation? Or is it linear correlation or non-linear correlation with a threshold? Please make it simpler and closer to layman understanding. In this study, they compared it with cephadex and what I understood was that they tried to see the effectiveness of these two drugs. Please mention upfront. Line 80 - what does the numbers inside the parentheses mean, under cefalex? Line numbers 91 - 132 is too long for readers to recall what you meant.Please mention in each paragraph what are the outcomes you are trying to show? In figure 2, They are saying cftp is better than cephralex but how? By lowering the risk of failure or by lower doses? Make it clear. Questioning correlation and causality is important in science. However, failure to demonstrate correlation does not mean there is no correlation, or that there isn\u2019t a causal relationship. Furthermore, just because there seems to be a correlation between  two things does\u2019nt mean one causes the other. For example, You can line up peoples heights and weights in ascending order and show that on average lighter people are shorter and heavier people taller. But that doesn\u2019 t mean that being lighter makes people shorter or vice versa. It just means there tend to more light people who are also short and more heav peoplewho are tall.

Question: is Augmycor, Tulsi safe during breast feeding? \n ### Answer: Yes, most of the antimicrobial drugs are compatible with breastfeeding, except for a few which have a very narrow margin between the blood concentration that controls infection and the concentration affecting the CNS. Hence, such drugs that have been identified as contraindicated for breastfecting mothers include meprobamate, metronidazole, and cefdinir. As regards Augmentech, tulsimbin, sulfamethoxazol, trimethoprim etc, these are considered relatively safe for use during lactation, although some may (like sulfonamides) cause reduction in milk flow and diminished infant weight gain (although not in case of breast pump suction). This is mainly because all these drugs will be present in the breast milk in very low levels, or at most in small doses (as is the case with mebroamine and chloramphenicol), or have excellent vertical and/or horizontal transfer (sulfamayloxazo,l ornidiazole) or will act only on the gut flora (metranidiral meropenem); or, due to their pharmacokinetic or pharmaco dynamic properties are not likely to enter the brain or cause neurodeplorization e.g. lomezepam, carbamazepine, etc. On the other hand, many breast cancer patients are often advised not to breastfeed their babies, either for few weeks after the surgery or throughout the duration of their treatment - depending on whether they were taking radiation therapy or chemo therapy and how long they continued these treatments. This caution is because the drugs used increase the risk of cancer in their baby. For example; carboplatin, cisplatin and gemcitabine have all been shown to increase cancer risk in babies.84,4%85,What happens if I dont take my cheque?If you dont pick up your cheques, you wont be able to pay for your medication and you may not be followed up in this clinic.

The reason I wouldn\u2019t choose it has to do with the fact that there are so many UTIs that are caused by E. coli, that that would be my first concern.

The generic formula for biguanide compounds is (C4 H10 N5 S2)X, where X is a monovalent ion, and biguezine and metfumide, are examples from this group. Question Answer2.Is the active moiety of phenformine hydro-choloride the free base or the ion of what would be the parent (uncharged) molecule? Could it be defined in terms of either bigguanidine or guanfuidine, or is it a new molecules with a different formula?If phen-formimid is the correct formula then surely it should be phen -form-amid (with the amide group (-NH-) displacing the (-Cl) as the \u201cmid\u201d suffix ?)

Or, do the pills only shrink the vessels and once the dosage is decreased or discontinued, the vessel size remains, therefore causing future acnes to cause raised, red \u201cscars\u201d? Also, I still have some redish marks on my face that I had for a very long time \u2026 will they go down? Is there anyway I can get rid of the \u201cmarks?\u201d What about the dark spots on the face \u2026 that was also advertised to goaway on accrue website (dark spots & acnedecrease@gmail.com) as one of their so called benefits \u2026 how do I get a refund for this? Are these people even real? Why do these acids and pill forms only last 4 or 6 weeks, but the results are suppose to last months without stopping? How long does it take for each ingredient to wear off? This also raises another concern \u2026 is the reason why some spots went down in the first place was because of all the chemicals used. And now, after stopping the medicine the spots returned \u2026 are they really gone for good? Was the discoloration only temporary? And what about this whole idea that taking these pills will prevent future breakouts \u2026 what if what ends up happening is that by taking such a high number of pills, you fill your body with ingredients that will be released into your bloodstream whenever your immune system is stressed (like when you have an acute illness or injury).

Just remember to take your vitamins, and tell your doctor if you think your pregnant. Question: What happens at 2 month appointment? Do you get to keep accolate? No more acitretin? So, you are saying I may be off of medication for rest of life? I am just trying to get an idea of how this would work. I take 30mg every night. It's been 5 months and acute migraines are under control. How long would I need to taper off medication before getting neurofeedback training? Question Questionb: Did people tell you their story? How that make you feel? A little weird? Did you cry? Was it sad to hear those stories? When people share intimate stories it can be really special, what do you do to show you heard them and to make them feel comfortable. When I listen to people\u2019s stories I feel happy for them, that they shared with me, I want to help, protect, be close. Sometimes I cry, it is rare, but if it happens I wipe away the tears and continue listening. After it I might need some time to think about everything I heard and process the information. Then I show them how I appreciate their brave. In some cases I invite them to a second conversation to give them more space to tell me more if they want or need. This is a process of building a therapeutic Relationship and trust, for me the most important part of this job. And the lack of it or its breach (in any direction - therapist or client) seems to me one of the primary reasons for deterioration of mental health among people. Do I gain as much from it as I give? Probably even more. Did I help them? In most cases probably more than they helped me. My job is always to accept, to understand, sometimes to forgive, always, however,to stay true to myself and my professional code. To stay on my path without losing my identity.

One of the major transmission scenarios for Cdiff in hospitals is the hands of Caregivers (and or visitors) who had been in contact with a C diff shedding patient. Hence person in the environment and caregiver hands are two important sources of spread.

Question: 63,Can babies get hand-foot-and-mouth? \n ### Answer: Answer = Yes, babies can get mouth infection, but it rarely causes hand and foot blisters. Hand-to-face, oral\u2013oral, or hand contamination for enteroviruses causes mouth lesions. For babies, this disease is known as \u201cherpid\u201d or \u201cmolluscum infectiosum\u201d . This virus tends to spread among unvaccinated children and can also infect adults. This disease usually causes mild illness, with blis- tering of the hands and feet. Other symptoms include high fever, diarrhea, vom- ing, mouth ulcers, pinkish skin eruption, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, pus- filled ears, conjunc-tivities, chills, headache, dengue-like illness that last 2-3 days and sometimes a rash. Mothers and caregivers should wash their hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid the spread of infection. Fever should be managed with medication as directed in the package label (such as paracetamol). In some severe cases, intra-venous fluid hydration and hospitalization are required .

Question: 66,What causes bruises?\n8 AnswerIt happens when blood collects beneath the skin. Bruises usually fade within 24 hours. If the blood forms a clot and collect beneath skin, it may become hard and discolor the color of skin for few days or it does\u2019t go away.The mechanism or reason how blood collection beneathskin is caused is still not known. Some scientists and researchers are trying to find out the reason. For example, someone said that if the veins or tiny blood vessels (capillaries) are not working properly or are damaged, then this may cause blood to collect underneath skin and thus bruise forms. Also there are many factors that play a role for bruising to happen including the amount of force that was applied, the area affected, and the direction of the force.Furthermore, different skin type reacts differently when getting bruised. White people usually have the lowest reaction while Asian and Black people bruiser easier and more.This article is about how in our body there exists a thin layer of tissue beneath our skin that is called subcutaneous tissue. This tissue is made of fat and connective fibres and vessels. Under certain conditions this sub cutaneous fat can be mobilised (for example in severe illnesses). This fat has the appearance of flesh just like the fat collected in the hip region and under the chin in many individuals. In fact the sub-cut fat that mobilises in disease conditions is the same fat as that in fat accumulations in different parts of our bodies. The difference is that the latter is stored fat while the former is an adaptative response to stressors. Thus brucellosis is among the diseases in which this mobilisation is reported. Furthermore, this fat seems predisposed to some diseases such as diabetes in that it stores more fats even when the stored fatt is mobilized in illness conditions.Brucellais one such illness in whichthe organism multiplies and survives in tissues of infected individuals for a long time (considerably longer than other acute diseases). Under this disease condition, there is a marked change in blood sugar level in infected individual. As the case may be, individuals who haves suffered brucelosis may store fater in unusual places and in enormous quantities."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4324, "rouge1_r": 0.1749, "rouge1_f1": 0.249, "rouge2_p": 0.0411, "rouge2_r": 0.0165, "rouge2_f1": 0.0235, "rougel_p": 0.2027, "rougel_r": 0.082, "rougel_f1": 0.1167, "bleurt": 0.163, "bert_score_p": 0.7411, "bert_score_r": 0.8368, "bert_score_f1": 0.786, "hallucination": 90.9090909090909, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.2628}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3919, "rouge1_r": 0.107, "rouge1_f1": 0.1681, "rouge2_p": 0.0411, "rouge2_r": 0.0111, "rouge2_f1": 0.0175, "rougel_p": 0.2162, "rougel_r": 0.059, "rougel_f1": 0.0928, "bleurt": 0.2372, "bert_score_p": 0.7662, "bert_score_r": 0.8211, "bert_score_f1": 0.7927, "hallucination": 36.36363636363637, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1934}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4459, "rouge1_r": 0.1041, "rouge1_f1": 0.1688, "rouge2_p": 0.0822, "rouge2_r": 0.019, "rouge2_f1": 0.0308, "rougel_p": 0.2568, "rougel_r": 0.0599, "rougel_f1": 0.0972, "bleurt": 0.2068, "bert_score_p": 0.7842, "bert_score_r": 0.844, "bert_score_f1": 0.813, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1815}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4189, "rouge1_r": 0.1127, "rouge1_f1": 0.1777, "rouge2_p": 0.0822, "rouge2_r": 0.0219, "rouge2_f1": 0.0346, "rougel_p": 0.2297, "rougel_r": 0.0618, "rougel_f1": 0.0974, "bleurt": 0.2341, "bert_score_p": 0.7692, "bert_score_r": 0.8349, "bert_score_f1": 0.8007, "hallucination": 81.81818181818183, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1922}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4595, "rouge1_r": 0.1149, "rouge1_f1": 0.1838, "rouge2_p": 0.0685, "rouge2_r": 0.0169, "rouge2_f1": 0.0272, "rougel_p": 0.2432, "rougel_r": 0.0608, "rougel_f1": 0.0973, "bleurt": 0.2484, "bert_score_p": 0.7779, "bert_score_r": 0.8342, "bert_score_f1": 0.8051, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1819}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4595, "rouge1_r": 0.0861, "rouge1_f1": 0.145, "rouge2_p": 0.0548, "rouge2_r": 0.0102, "rouge2_f1": 0.0171, "rougel_p": 0.2703, "rougel_r": 0.0506, "rougel_f1": 0.0853, "bleurt": 0.2912, "bert_score_p": 0.7965, "bert_score_r": 0.8321, "bert_score_f1": 0.814, "hallucination": 27.27272727272727, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1435}]}
{"Question": "Is flu test same as influenza test ?", "Free_form_answer": "The flu test and the influenza test are the same thing. \"Flu\" is a common name for an acute respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. If you experience a sudden fever, cough, and muscle aches during the winter months, it's likely that you have influenza. In such cases, an influenza test can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. However, in most cases, there's no need for a test since the symptoms during flu season are enough to diagnose the illness. The illness is self-limited in individuals under 65 years of age who are normally healthy. However, older patients or those at higher risk for complications may need a test.

Women themselves should learn the symptoms and signs, as well as how a breast examination should be conducted, through special applications, websites, or instructional videos. The men can assist their partners by practicing breast self-examination and helping to remove any barrier to examination. They can also assist in arranging for an appointment with their healthcare provider, driving their partner to appointments, taking notes during the appointment, learning about any follow-up tests, attending any scheduled appointations, picking up any prescriptions, helping with skin redness/heat, massage, compression, etc. During the COVID-19 pandemic, men should continue to support their female partners in all aspects of their health, including breast health.4KU,3KUKumar M, Vijay R.

All this information was given to me during a conversation with a nurse before my operation. Is the above a correct description of what is going to happen to my body? Question\uff1aI am worried about a cyst in the ovary. What should I do? Is surgery the only option? Can the cist be drained? What happens when the fluid inside is draining? Would it collapse or will the production of new fluid continue? These are the questions I asked myself when I found out that I had a 4 cm cst in one of ovaries. My doctor only told me that once the option of surgery comes, we cannot rely on any other methods to get rid of it. He recommended me to make the final decision after weighing the pros and cons of each option and what I want from life. Several questions arise in this case and there is no definite answer to all these queries at the moment. If I decide to go for surgery, will I be left with partial or no fertility? The answers to these questions cannot be given at a particular point of time. However, the doctor said that depending on the size of ct and its location, it may or may not affect fertilit. Further, questions pertaining to the occurrence of problems if I choose to retain the Ct can also be asked. These questions should be raised so that the experts can provide relevant information and help make a sound decision. Therefore I request that these topics be considered while compiling the modules for the patients. Along with these, I would like to ask the other question too.

This patient had abdominal distension and fever. 8,Why did you give colchicine instead of methotrexate or leflunomide which are DMARDs? DMRDs are typically given for long-term control of RA whereas colclicin is given as anti-inflammatory agent which acts more in the short term. So, it is possible that colthiciene was given instead a DMARDS because at the time the patient presented with severe pain due to RHS, DMARTs would not had been the first choice of treatment as they can take several weeks to significantly reduce pain. Today, however, there are reports of good long term prognosis following treatment with methrotrexte and lefnomude [58., 64.] and so these would be good choices in a patient whom is suffering ongoing pain as well as trying to reduce inflammation in her joints long tern.

Meniscuses do not regenerate, so mine will continue degenerating. Surgery may be necessary at some point for a meniscal transplant. But I would like to postpone that as long as possible. Because I am young, my meniscectomy would be a relatively high risk for complications, than if I were older. How much degeneration before surgery is necessary? I do physical therapy to decrease my pain and to strengthen my hamstrings and quadriceps, alternately icing and heating my knee, taking NSAIDs, poking my tendons, massage, rest and elevation. My physical therapist says to defer surgery as my injury was a sports injury and in time I will heal. What do you advise? When should I consider undergoing menicectomy? Or does the menus in the human body repair itself? Question: 0,How do I know if my symptoms are serious?\n?  \n #### Answer 1,If your symptoms persist after a period of rest, then you should see a doctor or physiotherapist for an assessment. An assessment will determine if your injury is serious and if any treatment or further assessment is needed.It is also important to remember that the symptoms of meningitis and encephalitis can be similar to the flu. A fever is common in both cases, as is a stiff neck and a high level of perceived tension in meningeal structures. The illness can escalate very quickly.

I am in emotional pain because I realize how stressed I was and I still have so much work to", "### Answer: In intrinsic in the extensor mechanism. Extensor tendon is affected, so only ext. mechanism is compromised. No I am not. I would expect that as ext (and possible abd, adc and pd) weakness, which this condition does not appear to be causing, would result in flexion deformity if the tendons or ligaments were involved as well as the muscles. So I don\u2019t think this diagnosis is correct. My answer is NO, it is not normal, this disease is restricted to ext mechanism involvement.

Question-1,19-Is joint malformation a disability?\n?2,Should we get dressed in winter and take off in summer (meaning an outward appearance and behavior in accordance with established social norms based on the evaluation of the situation) or should we express ourselves the way we feel and what we want to do (i.e. wearing the desired clothing regardless of weather conditions). And if we choose the second alternative (to dress and behave the same regardless good or bad weather), can we expect society to accept us and make an effort to understand us? Or should our reaction (the way to dress) be a cue for others to make even greater efforts to adjust to our reactions?3,Does being autistic mean that one will always see things in black and white?

Question : 46,Should you take probiotics during antibiotic use? Please explain in detail. What is recommended in Children? Question/ 53,Does Clarithromycin ophthalmic contain sulfa? The label does not mention it but I want to be sure. If it does contain it, I will not use it. Otherwise I am planning to use this for my dry eyes. (Clothophoz1973) Question Answer/Expert opinion: clarithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial agent. Macrolides are not used to treat viral infections. Claritromycinyes contains alcohol and sulphites. Therefore, patients with alcohol or sulphan allergies should avoid the use of Clarimyicyn. The use among pregnant or breastfeeding women is generally considered safe based on the limited available data. Most experts agree that in case of uncomplicated dry eye syndrome, antibiotives should be used initially for a maximum of 2\u20133 days, only if there are unclear bacterial overtones.If you have a bacteremia or endocarditis, use the antibioprophylaxis for at least 10\u201314 days. For example, in endogenous endophthalmitis, we use antibodies for 6 weeks, but in exogeneous endo, this is based in the culture result.Clioquinol-based eyedrops can be considered as an alternative, although the evidence of effectiveness is limitedClinicians can still prescribe chloramphenicoleyed drops, if the patient desire, based upon their experience.Alternatives in unresponsive cases could be colchicine eyelots drops.", "18, 22\u201328 Question: What is the average time to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d after having the Norovirus/stomach flu/gastroenteritis?

Question 73 The average waiting time in public hospital outpatient departments in China is 646.4 minutes.Why is waiting in line so", "### Answer: I don\u2019t really know what the symptoms are for the virus, but I know a lot of people who have had it have experienced really severe stomach pains/crampings. Question: how long will a lump stay in guaianaus?\n? the lumps from these infections will be present for a longer duration, typically for about 7\u201310 days after infection and will probably be more pronounced in the early stages.(this is mentioned in your discussion section, yet it does not provide information regarding this specific question.) Question; Do lymph nodes usually get bigger before they get better? or smaller? Do they sometimes just get to a max size and then start to shrink? Question ### answer: My assumption is that as the immune response is working the node would get larger and at some point shrinking would occur as fewer immune cells are needed. However, I am not sure if this is accurate. Node size may be affected by a host of different factors not specific to the type of infection. The literature supports the assumption that lysis of neutrophils, monocytes and cellular debris within the LN may cause the initial swelling.113-120 As this \u201cpus\u201d is cleared and fewer Lympocyte effector cells (T and B cells) are required for immune surveillance, they shrunk. In essence, this may provide a window of opportunity for re-infection. I would assume that the specific immune cell composition, which usually reflects the stage of the infection should be similar. During an acute infection, one would presume that cytokines and effect cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and Antibody-producing Lg cells would be prevalent, and once the infectious agent is contained the remaining cells go back to creating a more homeostatic environment. Is this the case? Also, regarding the size of LNs in specific in these animals, do they remain the same size, increase, or decrease in size following infection?

However, some people find that reducing inflammation in the gut helps with their OC symptoms, so it might be worth trying a probioitic and seeing how you get on. It\u2019s also important to address any dietary concerns and or ipsychobiosociultural factors that may be contributing to the OCS and anxiety via a psychological intervention. Discuss with your GP or specialist. OCTN1 is the sodium channel most heavily implicated in Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) so any medication which affects this channel may have an impact on severity of symptoms. Please note that I am not able to provide specific medication advice. I would advise a discussion with the prescriber of your anxiety medication, as they will be able best to judge the interaction effects of probiods and your medication of choice. Patient specificity is key in these matters. General advice: \u2013 there is some evidence for effecs on mood from probios so if this is a big concern for you then they may help \u2013 if its Ocd specifically it's harder to say as there' s not been a lot of research but again if it can help anxiety and stress it will have some impact \u2013 ask your doctor about it and get their opinion also. As always if your symptoms get worse or you feel they dont get better then return to them and they can assess the situation and may need to change the probiors or what they are combined with or the dosage - but on the whole they seem safe and many have prebiotics as well which is an added bonus Question : how long to continue with trichomonas treatment ? ---- Answer : Is there any cure for trachomoniasis?

Make sure your blood thyro\u00d7id hormone levels (e.g., T3, T4, or TSH) have returned to normal before stopping medication.

Question: how many milligrams does memantine come in? \n #### Answer.: - The author seems to be confused about memantine. Memantine is an NMDA antagonist. How it works in detail is discussed in lectures of Neuropsychopharmacology, but the basics are that it is a antagnoist of NR2A and NRD2B subunits of the NDMA glutamate receptor. This is relevant because it determines its effects. Is the memamine used in this study a gama-CCB antognist? or a usepecific NVDRe antgnost? Does the authors think it might work for Parkinson or other glumatate related diseases? I have a gut feeling that this would work very well for parkinsons disease, what about alzheimers?

What I mean by that is, when I burp, there is usually a purpose to it\u2013like if I just ate something big or sweet. But lately, I have been burting more often and it seems unrelated to what I ate. My stomach is also rumbling more, and passing more gas\u2013with no reason. I\u2019ve also been experiencing some cramping in my abdomen. Is this normal?

Question: 52,How do u know if u hv liver damage from drinking?\n ### Answer: As the liver is silent to the outside, it is difficult to diagnose the condition of liver of an alcoholic without the use of any laboratory or imaging tests. The liver may appear normal or enlarged and the risk of developing alcohol-related liver disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed. About 85% of heavy drinkers show signs of fat accumulation in the livers after ten years of drinking. Over 40% fat in liver tissues are defined as steatohepatitis. It would often require decades of excess alcohol consumption to cause a liver failure or liver cancer. When the damage is so severe that the function of the organ cannot cope, alcohol -induced liver diseases may develop, usually after more than ten year of misuse80. If you are concerned that you might have liver problems from your alcohol use, you should stop drinking immediately and consult a doctor. 121 63 Question ### answer: Some studies have found that alcohol may have some positive effect on liver function tests as found by blood tests, which is inconsistent with what patients feel about their liver condition83. These studies show that abnormal blood test results in alcoholics were fewer than expected, including a normal (or even lower) level of blood ALT or AST, or even a lower level34, compared to what would be expected from the level9.

{"Question": "Is meloxicam same as naproxen?", "Free_form_answer": "Meloxicam (Mobic) and Naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve) are two different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They are both used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation, but there are some differences between them.\nMeloxicam and Naproxen are both prescribed for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, Naproxen is also prescribed for ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis, bursitis, and gout attacks. \nMeloxicam is only available with a prescription, whereas Naproxen can be found over-the-counter (OTC).

JN. 05/16/21 Question answer: My son was taking Zoloft for 7 years. It was working well. Last year, we decided to stop it and see how he would do. He did well, until November 4th, 5th when the SSRI was abruptly stopped. We started having issues with insurance. By Thanksgiving he became depressed and by December 3rd he attempted suicide. Thankfully, he is safe, his outpatient therapist increased his Zolmist to see if that would help, but then on January 8th they decreased it. From January to May he was depressed, attempted twice more suicide and then in May they increased the Zomist again. In June, they did a bi-weekly baseline and adjusted it again and in July he began to feel better.

Answer\n\n- if this is for anxiety that would be quite a lot as in 2 or 3 times a day which is about 50% of the maximum dose given as it says 700 \u03bcL or about a teaspoonful of a 10%, which would equate to about half or less than a full dose. Check this or clarify. Would this be like taking several doses of say 4/40 or something like that. I would have thought that 90/120 would give enough relief if the dose was well spread so I cannot see 60 as a problem. This is obviously more for pain relief but if its anxiety due to pain then same thing. But in fact if it was for headaches or so maybe the lower end would allow a more frequent dose to be taken. Could consider a stronger dose as the other is probably longer acting which again allows for more regular dosing.

Question:- 50,Is tylosin a macrolide?\n? - AnswerYes.Is it a drug that you would use?Probably yes, because we need lots of new antibiotics. Tylasin is used in animals. It is a broad spectrum, it should work on a lot of different bacteria.It may be good for humans, too, and if the dose is right, probably not harmful.The only thing is, if we use more and more drugs in the animals, the more they'll develop resistance and the less we'd be able to use the drugs to treat diseases.We also have to think about the environment. All the antibacterial substances end up in it, even if it's a tiny bit, they all add up. And we don't know what happens in 100 years. We need to protect our soil, our water. The same thing that harm the earth, will also harm us, we are a part of nature. So if there is no need for the drug, then why contribute to it?

There is limited information available on this topic. Question: Is PID a STD?\n?  \n### AnswerNo; PAG 61,Sexual transmitted diseases are caused, with the exception of HIV, mainly by bacterial infections. They are transmissible during intimate sexual contact or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. STIs may involve the urethra, cervix, rectum, vagina, urea and the blood and may even infect the eye. Paget disease is not caused but it is usually suspected and sometimes diagnosed by a physician on account of the clinical signs it produces, which can be similar to those produced by some STDS. However, the diagnosis of PAD requires a biopsy. A PIG is a wound caused in any part of a woman\u2019s genital region or anus by insertion of any object, usually for sexual stimulation or sexual intercourse.46,82 Question, Is pilonidal sinus a staph infection? Or just some folliculitis? Would be interesting to know what the authors consider as \"follicular origin\". I suspect both, but wouldn't exclude the first one.

Question: Tinea pedis is caused by a fungus, usually one of the species of dermatophyte.What is the most common treatment for T. pedise?The most com-mon treatment regimens for tinea pedecontain two types of antifungal agents. A more potent agent such as terbinafine or micronazole is used for 14 to 21 days, together with a preparation such a lycol liquid or povidone iodine in lotion, used every day for up to a month. There are also some evidences for using lumicol ointment. For resistant lesions, oral antimycotic drugs such g as fluconazol or itraconazoale may be used.60,134Is treating Tina pedisonly curative?Tineapedis and its recurrence have a multifactorial etiology. Therefore, treating only the lesional skin does not suffice to eradicate the fungi in many instances. This results in a high relapse rate. The factors contributing to recurrences have to be addressed besides treating the patient with antigenital medication. Genetic susceptibility, immune status, wearing of shoes, climate, occupational exposure and a broad range of cultural aspects can lead to the formation of lesons. Thus, preventing reinfection is a key factor and can only be achieved by improving the general hygiene of those persons who suffer from this condition.53,61 Question : Tinnitus is hearing noise 4 6 8 90 505.17645 Tin- tinn- tin- inu- sis.

Answer Question Question Answer 0.50,0512A carivor is an animal that eats meat, especially birds and mammals. Many carniores are called predators because they hunt other animals for food.Carnivores include many different kinds of animals, such as bears, seals, dogs, snakes, alligators, among others. These animals are usually tops in the food chain in their living environment.Most carcinines are also top consumers in food chains in which they live. Top consumers have little or no carnitine. Most carcionines must therefore eat meat to survive for protein needed. Such meat eating carntoors are carnvres. Other carcnivotes can survive on invertebrates and vegetation also.

Question: 93,What causes pain in the chest wall? \n ### Answer: Many patients report \"stitching,\" \"pressure,\" or \"constant ache\" in their chests soon after heart attacks. Some people worry they may have lung cancer after a persistent cough or breathing problems. Most lung cancers are in lungs, but about 12% are found in lymph nodes around the lungs. Lung cancer is often difficult to detect because the early signs and symptoms are like those of other more common lung problems, such as infections, injuries, and lung diseases. In fact, the majority of patients with lung tumors have a tumor in another part of the body but still complain of chest pain, cough, or breathlessness.If you are currently smoking, you have the best chance of detecting a lung problem early by checking your blood for cancer cells. The sooner you detect it, after you stop smoking that is, in its earliest stages, of course, then the more likely it is to be successfully treated. If you continue to smoke and develop a cough that does not go away, blood in your sputum, a constant pain or a lump in chest area, it would be wise to see your doctor without delay.

Question: what does a normal level of cystatin c look like in a 44 and 70 year old woman? And what would be considered a high level in the 60s? just trying to get a baseline idea of what a lab value would look Like? The article states that the lab values were normal but it does not state what the value was, and this is very important information to me. Question a Question b Question c What is proteinuria and what causes protein to leak into theurine? Is this a problem? No. This is not a clinical problem. If anything, it means that there is less protein uptake by the tubules, so renal function is superior to what we have estimated based on serum creatinine. Moreover, the fact that this patient has protein in his urneu means he has renu also, which probably makes his loss of protein subutdural during dialses amlodipine 5 mg be enouh to maintain his GFR near 100 ml/min. I would comment on the high levels of transporter protein 2 in your rene, as they are known to be elevated in certain renaL diseases. What are protein levels in yout patient? I have no information on this. It is important for you to find out. You should at least get your patient back to the basline level, before you consider starting him wouth any medication. In my opinion, there would not be any need to monitor closely during hemodialysis, if levels are normal. On the other hand, perhaps it would also be good to see what happens, when protein intake is low and heparin is used. Or maybe you wnw to test another ACE-inhibiting drug? Please keep me updated. Your actual data would certainly help me to make suggestions. Please try to adde a message every three days. Thank you.

In the absence of palpable or audible heartbeats, a health professional may detect narrowing of arteries in neck using LDS. However, LDW cannot detect vascular narrowings in this location. The narrowed artery causes the pulse in that location to be felt weaker or absent. A health profession should use LDD, and LDA to detect CVD in patients and refer them for the earliest examination and possible treatment.77 Question Question\n\n[NOTE: If reviewer comments cannot be addressed, or if the author(s) do not respond to reviewers in a timely manner, I will be forced to reject the manuscript.

Question - 721.61317,Which is harmful: being very skinny or being really fat? And what can it lead to?I think being fat is more harmful because obesity is associated with chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, stroke and cancer, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, as a model, extreme thinness is linked to starvation and starving to death. If you want to show a link between unhealthy weight and health consequences you should compare extreme obese and very lean individuals. My advice, instead of using the BMI, measure the percentage body fat using appropriate tools and measure indicators for each disease separately.

Question: 56,Is swine flu and H1N1 the same?\n?94,No, swINE flu is not the human HIN1 strain that causes seasonal flu or H3N2. Human HSN1 influenza was previously known as swinen flu. Now pigs are infected with human strains of the virus and it is called A HN (N = neumoneo, E = epocham, H = hemagglutin,), with various combinations of one of those to create H2N or 2H (which will be called swEH in this review) . Some strands of swH1 (Human) have been observed to infect humans, causing flu which is usually mild, although these strand have severe effects in infants and the elderly33. The majority of these cases were mild and did not require hospitalization. Therefore, this report was taken with serious attention to the lack of information regarding the severity of this illness.

Does the urine look different, is there some sort of \"allopuriol test\" that makes it change color? Is there a test for purin in the CSF? (not that I recommend doing that).

You should also elevate it if possible. If you have a lot of swelling, you may need to visit a doctor and they may give you some pills or a shot to help with the sweling. Question ### answer: If the black eyes and swollen lips are from a fight, then the best thing to do is apologize and move on. Do not retaliate. This will only lead to more trouble.If the bruises are the result of an accident, such as a car accident or fall, it is important to seek medical attention. The doctor can help reduce the pain and help you heal.It is also important, in these situations, to be honest about what happened. Lying about how you got the injuries will not help. In fact, if you are in an auto accident and you lie about having a pre-existing condition, and then you later try to use that condition as evidence in a lawsuit, the insurance company will use your own words as proof that the condition was not as serious as you claimed. It is best to always be truthful.I hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.

Question: 08,Is aloe vera gel good for hemorrhoids? \n ### Answer: I'm wondering if it would help with the \"pain\" associated with them. I have chronic symptoms, and I am trying to avoid things I would have to rectally insert (laxative enemas, suppositories, etc). Is the gel messy? Does it work? Would it help me? Question Answer = Yes, aloes verae gel is good to treat and sooth hemorroids (pads or salves containing aloin are also). Alovera helps to relax the veins and reduces the inflammation. However, it does not help in preventing recurrence of the disease. Question = 10,What are the causes of angiodysplasia?\n\n## Answer (1)\n>The authors mention angio-dys-plas-ia which is a wide range of pathologies with very different etiologies, be it congenital (which some would argue be categorized as vascular malformations), to acquired conditions related to malignancies, abnormal tumor growth, trauma, or infections in otherwise healthy tissues. Which is the specific pathology being studied by the authors? The text and the figure clearly refer to cases of concomitant AVM and Aortic aneurysm, which may or may not be related, to which etaologic factor do the Authors refer? If the focus is on congential angioksytosis, the use of eh terminology \"adenoid cystic carcinoma\" is incorrect and must be changed. The histology and genetic profile of adenoidcystis are very easily distinguished from the ones of hemangiopericytomas. This case report is in fact a nice illustration of one the known pitfalls in the accurate diagnosis of AMM by FNAB. It should therefore be used as a teaching case, not as an example of an established diagnostic technique. Likewise, while the clinical and imaging observations are useful, they are not sufficient for a diagnosis, in particular since the radiological features are rather atypical for AAM. If this case were to be published in a scientific article, I should recommend to add more classical AML cases to the analysis.

However, colorless urine can also be a symptom of other health issues like diabetes, kidney problems, diabetes insipidus, certain medications like diuretics, or pregnancy.

Question: 17,How do I know if my cholesterol is high?\n?2### Answer : Answer18,Choles-ter-ol (choles + ter-ole = head + tail) is a lipid (fat) that is present in all cells of the body. The blood coronary arteries become clogged with build-up of this chol-esterol, and this causes angina (chest pain) and heart attacks. If your total blood chlo-sterol level is 240 mg/dl or higher, you have an elevated level, which is not good. Total cholersteror level should be lower than 6.20 mmol/l (239.6 mg%)2.Cholest-erol levels Should be less than the tot-al cholo-st-ero1.What is choline?10,11,Do you know what cholin-e is?Please respond with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d12,Can You Describe What Choline Is?Use descriptors (What function(s) does chlorine contribute to within the cell?).0.02904938 Question : 08.3413,What helps pains and what helps gains in pain?01:00:30This is an important issue to address, particularly as the evidence we have so far suggests that commonly available prescription and over-the-counter analgesics such as aspirin and para-profenal have at best a placebo effect in TMD-associated pain.

Question: Can a person pass a STD test if they have Balsam of Peru in their semen?\n? Answer; The active ingredient in Bulsamofperu is natural latex. In the manufacture of condoms, this is used as the binding material which holds the two pieces of rubber together. So, if a male has hadsex, and used a latext condom, the STDCityZenith\u2122 will give a false positive result. This test detects anti-HPV antibodies. Any male whose test results are positive must be referred to the appropriate authority for confirmation and the necessary follow up investigations to be carried out. It is the same for females. The investigation will decide if the positive test result was a \u201ctrue positive\u201d (genital wart or cervical cancer) or afalse positive (HPVL1 null or other non-oncogenic genital HPV infection causing abnormal Pap smear). The aim of this study is to prevent false negative results. Refer S1 File for STDFALSEPositive results means that the test was correct and it really is a positive. For example, a man who has genitals warts (physically visible) and tests positive for HPVL 1 is \u201ccorrectly positive\u201d. If the result is negative and a follow-up positive colposcopy is done, then the HPVDxTest\u2122 was \u201cfalse negative\u201d and more investigation should be done to find out why the false result came up. See Table 4 andTable 5. A false-negative test can have serious consequences for both the patient and for population-level surveillance effort. From the clinical point of view, an HPVTDx\u2122 test that provides an incorrect \u201cnegative\u201d result to a woman who believes she has cytological abnormality (S1 Fig) can delay necessary treatment, putting her at increased risk for dysplasia progression and perhaps invasive cancer. An increased hazard of death is possible [2\u20134]. From a community-based perspective, false negatives generate a hidden population of new cancers not detected by the surveillance system. These canmers can propagate in the community and increase the incidence rate in future years (4) (thereby delay", "### Answer: Is my pee clear because I drink a lot of water, or because my body doesn\u2019t need to make more of it?

It can check for a variety of things, including specific gravity (SG), pH level, protein, glucose, ketones, certain chemicals, bacteria and white blood cells. The specific test in urinalysishighlights different substances that are either eliminated or concentrated in the urain. Urine usually has a specific graviy of about 1.005.

Correction: To demonstrate this would require a separate, controlled study with \u201cnormal\u201d foot function as the outcome. However, it may be possible to gather some preliminary evidence through a retrospective observational analysis of foot health parameters prior to and after an intervention, or podictaphy (podiatry) and chiropody (foot care) treatment. The null hypothesis is that there is no evidence of any direct or measurable benefit from first-contact podiyatry (that is, from the perspective of the patient, podiosome practice). This could for example be tested by looking at data for foot conditions from patients who were directed by a referral from their GP to the local Podiatral Service. If the sample is representative of all first contacts, then the data could be evaluated to see if there was any observable improvement in foot condition. Provision of self-care advice and footwear / stocking adaptation advice are part of routine Podiotry care and a large number of people could feasibly be included in such a study. It may not be deemed necessary to include shaving calluses from soles of feet as part as a routine treatment as this is usually only done in combination with other treatments.

However, glycerum can be used to moisten the skin and thereby reduce the sensation of dryness. This is especially useful when the sweats are combined with heat (104) (https://cloud.huest.edu.cn/app/a/public/uploaded/hupo/2021/06/31//700aeba42b03488fa4682e7717e638.pdf). Question: 59,Is there a medication for an ear infection?  ### answer: Yes, antibiotics are used for bacterial infections. 60,What is the medicine for a chest infection, cough, cold, or flu? AntibiotICS are not effective against viruses that cause the flu, chickenpox, and other upper respiratory tract infeCTIONS. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem, both for humans and the environment.61,Antibiotic resistance, What is it and how is this achieved? Bacterial communities have developed a variety of mechanisms to cope with exposure to antibi- otics, including reduced uptake of the drug, enzymatic degradation of antibacter- ial compounds, expression of efflux pumps and modification of drug targets. Microbes may use mobile genetic elements to acquire resistance cassettes and propagate them among community members, often resulting in resistance being linked to pathogenicity. Horizontal gene transfer of resistance can occur from environmental community to- rahs such as the soil or water, which may then transmit to bacteri a in human or animal bodies. Conversely, resistance may spread from hospitals to environmental and farm communities. Multidrug resistanceMDR is defined as resistance to 1 or more specific groups of antim- iclonal drugs: aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactams, fluorouracil, purine analogs, pyrazimamide and quinolones Question 01 is 7.1% of all questions, but here it is as number 2.

There are two kinds of cough, one is chronic and one acute. Acute cough is usually dry and comes and goes over a short time. Chronic cough usually last longer than 8 weeks and often turns into the other type of a moist cough. The main causes of chronic moist (wet) cough are bronchitis, pneumonia and tuberculosis. In many cases the cause of the chronic wet (mucus) coug h i s due to allergies (such as hay-fever) or to acid reflux from the stomach. Most of these coughs respond well to treatment.

Question: 4% of patients pass 0.5 mg OD but then need to increase to 1 mg BID? what's going on? [FAQ] A low dose of pregabalin may be used initially to minimize side effects, and then the dose may been increased if needed to achieve better pain control. Question ### Answer: The side effect profile with pregagbin includes dizziness, swelling, dry eyes, blurred vision, headache, diarrhea, constipation, weight gain, sleepiness and \u201cpins and needles\u201d sensation. Many of these side-effects are more common when starting pregogbin than when it is taken continuously. It is important to note the interactions with other medications such as alcohol, sleeping pills, muscle relaxants and anti-pain medications as these can cause severe drowsiness. In addition, there are other medical conditions where pregagenib may interact negatively. Please see the CALER GLOBAL website for more detailed information. On the other hand, the site also includes information for healthcare professionals which is very useful and can help with prescription and any co-administration with CNS active drugs. Overall, pregaben is useful in managing pain but it has a limited use due to the adverse sideeffect on some individuals. The dosage strength of 75mg may still be too low for some patients as they may require up to double the strength to get adequate relief. Patients require different dosages to obtain relief from pain and some may experience unwanted side affects when the dosing is too strong. A thorough assessment prior to prescription is required and this includes pain type, history, previous medication use, concurrent diseases and medication. Regular monitoring when on pregaban based therapy is also important. Some patients may have to change their doses based on how their bodies react to it and regular monitoring can also prevent adderamis type side affect. If your medication makes you feel dizzy have you asked your pharmacist about the possibility of standing up slowly to avoid feeling dizy?Or maybe a few of those exercises where you stand up and bend down a couple of times with your eyes closed?

Question: 15,How long should I bleed before trying again to conceive? \n ### Answer: Answer \u2013 Bleeding for 3 periods after the injection in one cycle and then not bleeding in subsequent cycles is a good indicator (Boehm et al., 2010).

Question:\"16,Should I stop my birth control if I want to get pregnant?\"?\n? Answer (Please say \"if I do not want\" instead of \"I do want\". Use of the future tension (tensors) is better than the present tense.) Question - 0,What tests might be done to evaluate sexual disorders? -?* 6.2What kinds of treatments are available for persons with sexual dis?51C,An evaluation of sexual functioning generally begins with a thorough history of previous sexual experiences and relationships, as well as a description of any problems that have been experienced. This should be followed by a physical examination, particularly in men, who are more likely to experience problems, such as pain or impairment of motion in their genital area, than women. In women, pelvic pain, vaginal symptoms, intercourse, and libido are the most frequent causes of disturbances in sexual function.In addition, several laboratory tests can be used to diagnose some types of female sexual dysfunction. For example, blood tests of FSH or other pituitary hormones can help identify women who have an organic problem in association of hypopituitarism. An ultrasound examination of clitoris and vagina can rule out genitourinary tract abnormalities. Sometimes, urodynamic and sexologic studies can also be helpful (in women with dysuria, voiding or voided urines of low volume, pain during interurethral distensions, or atypical pain in inter- urinary area).69080.3,", "I have chronic pain usually just take 800mg ibu to just get by it hurts still but makes it manageable.

Question: pneumonia vaccine how often? \n ### Answer: how long does it take to recover from pheonix pansilitis in adults Question Answer How often should you get a pneomonia vaccination? Check with your doctor, but depending on your age, you generally need a vaccenion once (if you have one already) and then a booster somewhere from 5 to 10 years later. If you are 65 or over, then you should get the vaccine and a boost every 4 years. I am not sure about ppl with asbestos or other lung diseases -you may want to check with doctor. Also, I read somewhere that people over 90 are not supposed to take nebulized vaccines because it might cause pnuemonia? But im not really sure. Please correct me if I m wrong. But still, even if it causes pnueomia, it is still best to have it so that the poneumia is treated rather than let the bacteria kill you. Doctors know better. The knowledge of the health care staff about these things also need to be improved especially among the nurses. They should at least advise you to go to the medical office upon the first sign of symptoms so you can be treated right on time. Those cough syrups and nasal sprays from herbal medicine and some drugstores may only make things worse. With regards to getting a vaccine, as stated earlier, there are different types of pnenomone vacinnes and the efficacy varies from one person to another. However, in general, vaccinations prevent, reduces or delays the exposure of virus or bacteria in a person which is vaccinated - that can prevent the spread of disease to other people. In relation to this, if you really want and believe in those herbs and medicine, please be a responsible citizen and get rid of those things in this case.

The influvirus causes the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. After the first exposure to the influavirus, the body produces antibody-secreting cells called plasma cells. These plasma cell then release antibiotics into the bloodstream that help fight off future infections by the exact same influzavirus. If the person is exposed to a different strain of influivirus, then the antibbodys produced from the initial exposure will not be effective. In this case, a person may still get the \u201cflu\u201d but the symptoms will usually not as severe as the frist time.

Question: 4,Is bronchiectasis caused by asthma? \n ### Answer: Asthmatics can develop bronchiolitis and eventually bronchiolectasis or Bronchietsius. This can be due to the repeated inflammation around the small airways and the narrowing due the muscularization of the airway wall. Most of them are the consequence of long-term persistent airflow limitation. The degree of narrowed airspace can vary from one patient to another depending on the severity of bronchodilator reversibility. There is no sufficient evidence to show that severe acute asthmatic attack can lead to permanent damage of air spaces . However, a study by Lee et al. showed that there was more damage to air space, as seen on CT scan, in older asthsmatis that had low lung function compared to those who had normal lung functions.The damage was proportional to severety of lung functional damage. They also found that broncchiolar and alveolar fibrosis was associated with air-space damage .Therefore, it is true that in some asthamtis, the degree air trap and damaged air Space can cause serious damage in structure and function of Air Space. Further study need to be done to find method to treat such airtrap airSpace. It is best to see video and photo of damaged Air space in asthimatic patient.Bronchial lung cancer can also result in damage air -space structure as well as small and large air bronching.In the pathogenesis of asthtma, Eosinophil inflammatory cells and other cells play an important role as do the inflmmatrory mediators like histamine and serotonin.Air spaces can get narrow due inflow of inflmmotry cells around alvlioli.Neovalproatea (as) in combination with hydrocortisone has been tried as therapy in patients with acetaminophen toxicity.Morphine an opioid has also shown to improve respiratory drive in spinal cord injury patients.Although these drugs are not tested and proven in Asthmantics, these can imply that air trapping and air way resistance can probably improve with these medications.There are also a lot of alternative therapy to ast"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.375, "rouge1_r": 0.1186, "rouge1_f1": 0.1803, "rouge2_p": 0.0631, "rouge2_r": 0.0198, "rouge2_f1": 0.0302, "rougel_p": 0.1696, "rougel_r": 0.0537, "rougel_f1": 0.0815, "bleurt": 0.262, "bert_score_p": 0.7899, "bert_score_r": 0.8109, "bert_score_f1": 0.8002, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.2478}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3125, "rouge1_r": 0.1026, "rouge1_f1": 0.1545, "rouge2_p": 0.027, "rouge2_r": 0.0088, "rouge2_f1": 0.0133, "rougel_p": 0.1696, "rougel_r": 0.0557, "rougel_f1": 0.0839, "bleurt": 0.2627, "bert_score_p": 0.7763, "bert_score_r": 0.7945, "bert_score_f1": 0.7853, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.244}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3304, "rouge1_r": 0.1221, "rouge1_f1": 0.1783, "rouge2_p": 0.018, "rouge2_r": 0.0066, "rouge2_f1": 0.0097, "rougel_p": 0.2054, "rougel_r": 0.0759, "rougel_f1": 0.1108, "bleurt": 0.2376, "bert_score_p": 0.7768, "bert_score_r": 0.7969, "bert_score_f1": 0.7867, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.2609}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3839, "rouge1_r": 0.1519, "rouge1_f1": 0.2177, "rouge2_p": 0.027, "rouge2_r": 0.0106, "rouge2_f1": 0.0153, "rougel_p": 0.1696, "rougel_r": 0.0671, "rougel_f1": 0.0962, "bleurt": 0.2565, "bert_score_p": 0.7697, "bert_score_r": 0.8129, "bert_score_f1": 0.7907, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.2755}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2946, "rouge1_r": 0.11, "rouge1_f1": 0.1602, "rouge2_p": 0.009, "rouge2_r": 0.0033, "rouge2_f1": 0.0049, "rougel_p": 0.1696, "rougel_r": 0.0633, "rougel_f1": 0.0922, "bleurt": 0.2385, "bert_score_p": 0.7729, "bert_score_r": 0.7954, "bert_score_f1": 0.784, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 60.0, "fluency": 0.2676}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3571, "rouge1_r": 0.1153, "rouge1_f1": 0.1743, "rouge2_p": 0.036, "rouge2_r": 0.0116, "rouge2_f1": 0.0175, "rougel_p": 0.2054, "rougel_r": 0.0663, "rougel_f1": 0.1002, "bleurt": 0.3008, "bert_score_p": 0.7903, "bert_score_r": 0.8126, "bert_score_f1": 0.8013, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.2366}]}

Generally, muscle cramps or spams will last for less than a minute or two. However, if the cause is due to overstretched muscles or overexertion, the pain may last longer. For example, back muscle pain or stiffness may take several days to weeks to fully recover. When the muscle is injured, pain sensation may continue for several minutes or even hours after the initial injury. The pain usually subsides after a short time. But if it does not, then you may have a more serious injury, such as a ruptured disc or a pulled muscle. Therefore, you need to see a doctor if you feel pain for more than 48 hours.

They control many processes in your body. These processes include metabolism, inflamma-tion, blood pressure, mood, electrolyte balance, water retention, body fat, protein, glycogen storage, immune response", "Minoxydil was associated with adverse effects, such as mild skin reactions, change in skin pigmentation, itching and burning. If your minxoidil product is new, check the label for information regarding use in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Avoid using other hair growth treatments, like keratin treatments and consider using a gentle shampoo that is free of dyes, surfactants, and parabens, to see if that helps as well.

The reaction may affect the skin, respiratory system, digestive system or eyes, etc.\u201d In this definition it is stated that the allerIC reactions can be \u201cIgEn mediated\u201d. By now, many allergens causing non Igre allergies are known. In some cases, the structural aspect of these allergN proteins may cause the allergIc reaction, independent of the ability to trigger IgrE receptor. Please revise this part of text and include the mentioned definition. Also, include examples for non-Igr allergn proteIns.10,Can you acquire an infection from re-using ear", "### Answer: No, there are no known serious side effects.

Question 2, Is it dangerous to take bupropion hydrochloride and escitalopram oxalate at the same time? Are there any interactions between these drugs? It is important to point out that, despite the brand name (imipramine), escitolamp oxale is in fact chemically identical to escitilopran oxamine, the antidepressant which is widely used (and discussed in the paper quoted above). Question ## Answer 3,Is it more effective to combine bph with another antihypertensive drug that acts by a different mechanism (e.g., nifedipine, hydroclorthiazide) or should bpha be used alone?Also: why not use a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipne instead of hydralazine since it is a long-term therapy?Amlodpine is mainly used for short- and medium- term therapy to complement the action of other classes of drugs in treating hypertension. It cannot be prescribed alone, but as a combination drug, it can be an alternative to hydrocortisone. Please see section 1.1 in S1 File for more information.The use of hydrocodothiaz ide for long term treatment will increase the incidence of adverse effects like drowsiness, weakness, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache and the most feared effect, a secondary non-functioning of the renal tubule like nephropathy. In the case of long use, amiodarone is better than potassium iodide based drugs.Hydralaz is used to treat short term acute hydronephrosis due to its diuretic action. Short term use is also used in other edema states and in shock. I would not recommend long time usage, as I noticed edematous conditions worsening in my patient.

Stool softeners and laxatives can treat constipation, whilst increasing dietary fiber or fiber supplements can prevent hard bowel movements. A topical vasodilator that is applied on or around the fissure, such as topical nifedipine or nitroglycerin, can be prescribed to promote healing.

Question : how often do you think a person should go the the doctor (or ER) when their symptoms of COVID-19 are mild?i.e. they feel well enough to manage on their own but are still contagious. Question > 613,23 Question 310,When is the best time to visit the ER during the COVID -15 crises? i.The rush in the hospitals and ERs is usually less during late nights (11PM - 5AM). II.Early mornings (5-8Am) may also be less busy as people wake up late during this crisis period. It could also provide you with an added edge \u2013 since you will be one of the first visitors to get to see the physician. And if you\u2019re feeling really sick you may want to consider visiting during off-peak hours.I think the doctors will appreciate the extra precaution and effort you are taking to minimize your risk and that of others. They are also less likely to be overwhelmed and run-down and thus may provide less stressed consultations.And while it may not be the case for many, this may actually be a good time (less crowd to navigate, less physical visits) to go see a doctor in person instead of over a virtual/phone consultation.Remember to call ahead before you go and check the hospital\u2019", "### Answer: I can give you a cream that will help with the itching and pain, but it won't cure the fossa. For that, you'll need surgeon. Question: Is it really true that there is no cure for fibromyalgia?\n\n? Please rephrase this. It is too strong a statement with so many patients and families searching for hope. At the same time, we must be realistic and honest about the current state of knowledge. I think this is a great question to show how science is evolving; a good example of how patients can help research. We should be able to suggest, in a positive way, that more research is needed on this topic. So, I suggest to rewrite this sentence. The goal is to empower patients, without disappointing them. They could be potential collaborators in research teams in the future. Patients are often more willing to give up than professionals; they don' t know the other languages of research (statistics, protocols, deadlines, grants \u2026), and are easily frustrated by the first few disappointments. But they are the ones whose fingers hurt when pressing on the keyboard of the computer we use to work on, reminding us what lies beyond the numbers, the percentages, and the p-values. Thank you for allowing me to point this out. This is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. A positive statement that recognizes the pain and suffering of patients while suggesting that we work together to find solutions, instead of relying on ineffective treatments.

Question: 06,Is licorice good for acid reflux? \n ### Answer: Licorices are roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra, G. uralensis, or G, inflated. They have long been used in herbal medicines and are traditionally categorized as \u2018sweet\u2019 foods. As with many herbs, no single plant is used for all purposes. Liquoricianone is extracted from the roots. In 1998, Nishi et al. reported that liquiritoside (LIQ, glycoside of liquoricientine) is effective in treating gastroesophageal refluxture (GER). The major mechanism of action of LIQ is inhibition of gastric acid secretion. LI was suggested as an alternative therapeutic option to treat dyspeptic disorders, including dysphagia due to GORD. Further studies were recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of this agent.10,Dyspepsia is a syndrome characterized by the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: postprandial upper abdominal fullness or pain, post prandrial nausea or vomiting, and upper acid aeros. When severe, these symptoms may interfere with the patient's quality of life. The prevalence of dysepysia in the general population is 7 to 8%. In cases that are severe the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been shown to be effective.

To get treated, you need to kill all the worms and remove all their dead bodies from your body. If you don\u2019t do that, the dead body of the roundwurm will still keep producing eggs. Once these eggs hatch in your intenstine, it will continue to produce more worm which will continuously infect you again and even pass onto others, so you will need treatment for a life time. So the first important step is to go to the hospital, get proper medications and kill the adult worm of worm so that they cannot produce eggs which cause the disease to persist. Then the medications will be given to you so as to prevent you from re-infecting yourself and others around you. During the treatment, make sure you follow the instructions of health staff and finish all medications. Also, as mentioned earlier, practice open defection. Do not use a latrine or flush toilet as that will only spread the infection. A lot of people may see it as a sign of weakness and thus not following the instruction of medication. Question:-24, How do u cure a urinary tract infection?  \n ### Answer 4155.650Urinary retention is a serious condition that can potentially lead to kidney damage if not treated promptly. It is important to clear a UTI first before attempting any dilatation of a stricture. In most cases, a course of antibiotics should be administered prior to any procedure.[12\u201314] The most common route of administration of antimicrobials is oral, although there are circumstances where intravenous access is more appropriate. The duration of therapy will vary based on patient factors such as age, underlying medical conditions, prior antibiotic use and epidemiological factors, for example, bacterial strains and resistance patterns in different geographical locations. As a general guideline, treatment should continue for at least 7 days, with longer durations (10\u2013 1 maximum 6) in those with complicated or protracted infections (eg, Esch", "YES/NOA No. Commonly, this condition causes a ring-like lesion on the head, neck or body, in contrast to tineamental granular skin, which causes diffuse scaling of the skin.

It can affect up to 1 in 7 people in the UK and is more common in women. It is caused by a hardening of blood vessels in certain tissues, mainly in fingers and toes, but also in noses and ears. This can cause a temporary loss of feeling in those areas.It is estimated that half of all cases of primary (idiopathic) Raynaud's disease will resolve without any intervention within a few years, and many will not even know they have it.40,41,77 Question ### answer: Tinglers = yes; Burning pain in legs = No; Aches in feet = Yes; Pain in toes = 64,Sensation of prickly needles =22.86,Heat in middle of palms =99.35,Gallbladder disease =No;Canker sores =Yes;Stomach aches =Continually;Back aching =Often;Bloating =Sometimes;Changes in bowel habit =Every day;Passing gas =About the same;Feeling of nausea = Never;Vomiting = Less than twice; Swelling = Non-existent;Diarrhea (mild, moderate or severe) =Mild;Constipation = Moderate;Loss of appetite = About the the Same;Nauseated = Sometimes;Food aversion =Never;Decreased appetite/want to eat =More than others;Exercise or physical activity avoided = Often;Social life /great events avoided because of GI problems = Constantly;Confident to have a good appetite and eat/drink a normal meal = Almost always;Concern about digestive processes =", "### Answer: Yes, tineids are contAgious.

The diagnostic criteria for factitoius disorders is that patients must make repeated claims of having a physical problem that is either exaggerated or, in some instances, fabricated. Patients with factorious disorders are often anxious and may even believe their own symptomatology. Because of this, these patients may be very sick, both physically and psychologically. Their symptoms can lead to many unnecessary tests, operations, hospitalizations and other interventions.

In addition, person to person contact, via respiratory droplets, results in infection f.e. Typhus is transmitted by bites of infected fleas, usually those living in rat harbor.The disease can also be transmissible through transfusions of contamine blood (RBCs or plasma) from infected donors.

If I have them, what kind of antibiotic should I take? \n ### Answer: What is the cause of my infection? What kinds of bacteria can cause it? These are questions that your doctor or nurse may not be able to answer. That's because it'd take too long to get the bacteria from your body, grow them in a lab, and find out what kinds they are. Instead, your clinician will use their knowledge of common bacteria and viruses to treat you. They'll also often ask you for symptoms in order to help with the diagnosis and treatment. But if you do have virulent bacteria causing your illness, this may lead to a more serious infection that'l need stronger or longer treatment.(2)98,What does it mean when I feel pain in my chest? Is it serious? I\u2019m only asking because, well, sometimes I get uncomfortable/painful sensations in that area of the body - but I know that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. I assume you\u2019re asking in relation to heart disease, but it\u2019s worth emphasizing that not all pain or discomfort in the chest is cardiac (e.g. stomach ache, sore ribs, lung Cancer, etc). Also, it goes without saying that these feelings should still be checked out by medical professional, even if the pain doesn't seem serious. (61)30,29,48 How can I tell the difference between a UTI and a kidney infection (pyelonephritis)? \u2013 UTIs are infections of either the urethra, the kidneys, or both. Ureteritis, which is influlation of urothelium (the thin layer of cells lining the tube that connects the bladder to the kitchenneys), and pyelitis (inflammition of kideny tissue, including the reney pelvis) are subclassifications.14 When the only sign of infection is found in urine without any kidrey signs or symptoms, then the infection can most probably be attributed to U. When pyuria (presence of white blood cells in Urine) is associated with systemic signs, such as", "### Answer: I am allergic to dust mites, pollen, and pets and have sinus problems. When I have allergies, I get a sore throat. I also have acid reflux, which can feel like heartburn, or a knot in my stomach. The acid doesn\u2019t come up into my throat, so it doesn't cause phlegm or excessive mucus. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with acid reflex and pressure in ears. This paper suggests that most of chronic throat problems are caused by acid and phytohemagglutinin (a protein found in plants). It is possible that the patients\u2019 acid problem is exacerbated by phytochemicals in plant proteins. Question: Is vomiting contagious?

Some people are more prone to get vomitors even with mild discomfort in tummy.A, There are persons who are considered to be more vulnerable to getting vomitting illness than others.4, Once you have vomitted, there is no need to stop as there isn'Q, If you are vomittig, you should force yourself to eat something.N, You should stop vommiting whenever you feel the urge to throw up and try to force down something to \u2018absorb\u2019 the acid.The Question. Is yellow fever still around today? Could you catch it from a mosquito? I know people who say they had yellow body fluids coming out of their eyes, ears, noses and rectums; and that it was transmitted by mosqutoes. These people also say that if you drink \"sani-flush\" (15% sago", "### Answer: Allergy doesn't seem to be a factor in phlegm in the winter so I'm not sure of the connection. I would also remind the authors that phantosmia and dysgeusia are still active at the time of writing so this isn' t a typical, or even a hypothetical \u201crecovery\u201d - the assumption being that at some point people will \u201cget their sense of smell and taste back\u201d and life will return to normal.

Question ### answer: -Allergic rhinitis, -Atopic eczema, \n### Answer 70,Allergy test, IgE testIgA testAlthough I am allergodermatitis, but I had no tests before.I had always sneezing, coughing with some wheezes, even had some difficulty in breathing.Severe pruritus and sometimes (about 2\u20133/year) generalized erythematous.Rosacea, facial skin burning sensation, redness, itching.Tiredness and depressed mood (this allergenic symptom seems to be an unrecognized one).Sometimes, after some exercise, my chest felt heavy and I couldn\u2019tknow what was happening. I thought it was my heart.Ever since I was a child, when I got a cold, i.e., cough or cold or flu, immediately my face got red. And as I grew older, worse skin problems occurred (eczemas, Seborrheic dermititis).I used to throw up often and almost every morning, at least ten years.When I turned 40 years old, the doctor found polyps in my nose. At that time I also had a strong burning and itchy sensation in the chest area, especially at night(yellow fever).When it rains, or even just thinking about it,I got severe cough and difficult breathing, and these days I often dream that I drown in fluid (mucus).Also I suffered from a feeling of pressure and fullness in earr, which turned into tinnitui.Beside these, suddenly having blurry vision in both eyes (recently) is a new symptotm.Other than that, there is also a dull ache and pulling sensation behind my eyes, as well as extreme sensitivity to light and sounds.The last one is", "E.g. is it more common in people who have lots of other allergies? If not, it'd be a fairly random symptom to include in the list of things that define allergic prone people. Wouldn't it? Question: 51,My blood smear test showed that I have leukaemia, is this a cancer? \n ### Answer: Leu-ka-em-ia is a type of cancer, called a myeloid, or \u201cmyelomonocytic\u201d or just \u201cmonoc-yt-ic,\u201d leukem, in which all the cells are white blood cells that have similar appearances. It is so-called because the le-uk-emic cells do not stop dividing, unlike normal white cells, which stop once they reach a certain count in what is called \u201cthe left nose of the curve.\u201d The disease is curable when it has just begun, but unfortunately, most people do no seek medical care and are thus suffering from advanced stages of this disease. Question ### answer: Answer is no,it is not a Cancer.Myth:All the cancers in our body are due to large number of white Blood cells.If all types of can-cers start from the white-Blood cells; then by chemotherapy they should kill all white can certains; and also in-treatment they have to face al-lergic reactions from white cell-s; if by chance in a population if we find any cancer due t-he large numbers of White blood-cells then that should also be cancer of Monocetes; as in leprosy; there is involvement of both lymphocytes and monocy-tes.So, as per my understanding this is only a mis-conception. This is simply like saying; all canc-ers are blood b-orn; or more correctly al lthe blood cancerts were due from t h-at particular gene; which is also not true.Truely cancer is due m ybad genetic alterations.The gene which causes cancer i may not be- due u whiteBloo d cellsc.

{"Question": "My cat was just diagnosed with a tapeworm, could that be something I can get from him?", "Free_form_answer": "It is possible to contract a tapeworm from an infected cat, although it is not common. There are two types of tapeworms that can infect cats. The most prevalent type is Dipylidium caninum, which does not directly infect humans. Ingesting a flea that is infected with the tapeworm is the only way humans can contract it, and it usually happens through close contact between children and their infected pets. The second type of tapeworm is Echinococcus multilocularis, which is less common in cats. This tapeworm can be transmitted to humans by ingesting feces from an infected animal. To reduce the risk of contracting these tapeworms, it is essential to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after handling your cat and its feces.

However, the question of how we will make up for the time we have missed remains unanswered. We should add this point at the end of the paragraph. It is important to note that even if we don\u2019t have fever but we still feel sick and have cough, we need to stay at rest until the cough reduces. This will prevent the risk of contracting pneumonia or other complications. Our immune system also needs time to recover. The flu might last for around 7 days, or more for some people.

The prognosis of HPR is good, most patients remain ambulatory and enjoy an active and long life. Hsp is inherited as a recessive disorder in most cases. A phenotype with dominant inheritance is found in few families, whereby clinical severity is less pronounced. More than 70 mutations in a single gene (spr) located at chromosome 9q22. 3 have been described. Further genes for HS may be located on chromsome 17 and 5 C to explain some cases of autosomal dominant hereditary spatic parpareglia. Question : 4.67980-Will I pass this on to future generations? This is probably the most fearsome question of all for the prospective parents. This future generation will of course, be faced with all of these same questions that I have posed here, the answers to which will ultimately determine his/her outlook on life as well.

A walking boot may be useful in some cases. 64Is an injection in their spine all that\u2019s keeping their arteries from clotting?As above. No, but potentially, yes. In 8.4% of cases, anti-HS virus antibodies are found in blood. So there is some immune response. Also, if bacterial infection leads to inflammation in joints and around these vessels, that inflammatory response can prevent blood from coagulating (forming blood clots). Yes, potentiallyYes9.6%18,Why is it called Still\u2019 s disease?Often these diseases get their names from the doctors who discover or become interested in them. Dr. Benjamin Still, a pediatrician, first described the condition in 1920 as arachnodactyly with a family history. \u2018Arachno\u2019 refers to the Greek word for spider, apt in relation to patients with long, spindly fingers. Still named his patient reports \u2018arachnoid dysplasia\u2019, but the term arachesylas syndrome became more common. Later, in mid-2Oth century, Dr Oliver Patterson described archesylus hyperkinetism syndrome. Finally, Still's disease refers most to Dr Still himself,", "22,051,When a woman has a baby, her ovarian tissue is permanently reduced.

Question: 2,Is PCOS a STD?\n?PCO is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, but insulin resistance is often associated with it. 3,Pcos is considered to be a condition related to an irregular ovulatory cycle. What is the main cause of ovulation disorders in Pcos \u2013 excessive luteinizing hormone (LH) levels during follicular development, or insufficient folicule-stimulating hormione (FSH) secretion? (Excessive LH levels have been suggested to result from increased lypolysis of the hormosin clevage products in the ovarian tissue of women with POS.)4,In women, the pituitary gland produces FSH and LSH hormones. Both hormoes act on the ovary and induce the production of estrogen hormoe. If the FSH level is high enough, it causes the maturation of many folia. But, If there are low levels of FHS in blood, there will be maturity of only a few folias, and this would result in ovulating only once in a month. On the other hand, high levels LHS causes growth and maturing of all the folicles in an extreme manner (overshooting) and hence resulting in development of cysts and finally leading to ovulfction.5,High degrees of insuli resistance are associated to the genes for the insuline receptor, which are inherited from the father in case of Pcros. Hence the son of a woman with CLO is estimated to have a one in five chance of suffering from PcoS, with additional incidence risks being established by the presence of any of those genes from either parent.

{"Question": "NSAIDs bother my stomach, is there anything I can take with that to prevent irritation?", "Free_form_answer": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that are widely used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. NSAIDs have some side effects that affect the gastrointestinal tract, such as gastric inflammation, esophageal reflux disease, and ulcers. In order to reduce these symptoms, it is recommended to take NSAIDs after a meal rather than on an empty stomach and avoid alcohol use, as it can also irritate the stomach.

On the other hand, common bile duct stones (also known as gallstones) are the fifth most common cause of hospitalization and the most frequent cause related to pancreatitis. Common biliary diseases, including cholelithiasis, choledocholithriasis, bilioptysis, gallstone palsy, hepatitis, etc. are often closely related, even the bilirubin levels abnormality are also caused by disturbance of the gall-bladders. The treatment of these diseases always requires the whole-hearted cooperation of pneumologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists and other related physicians. So it can\u2019t be denied that gall bladders have some effect on human health, in a positive or negative way. As mentioned above, human gall bils commonly have no symptoms, no matter whether there are stones in them or not, thus, many people choose to undergo cholescystectomy for various reasons, either for the removal of gall stones, or to prevent possible future problems. Nevertheless, little is known about the pathophysiology of choloesc", "### Answer: I\u2019m going to assume that you mean non-surgical treatments. I didn\u2019t think so. If so, yes there are many different treatment methods and they generally get more and more invasive/powerful as necessary, but you didn't really provide any information about these options. Maybe list them and then give the ones you recommend? I would think this should be based on the patient presentation, so maybe an algorithm would help here. Question: Can you cut the tissue around the molluscum contagiosum? Tissue surrounding what? It is around moles; but around what for the other lesions?The treatment protocol for mucosal lesion of genitalia depends on morphology, etiology (HPV associated or not), and level of dysplasia in the lesional minscules. You will probably not cut any normal tissue in these areas. For cutaneous malignant lesiones in particular, such as amelanotic melanoma, a wide surgical margin is desirable for curability. It looks like the margin for cutaneomucocos junction is not as clear.How do you manage a cut that is deeper than the dermis but not involving the fascia?

Was this the case in this patient? If it was not close enough for an accidental spill to cause a hematoma and an obvious ecchymosis, I am not sure how this could be used as a teaching point.1,5 Question Answer 4,How about the possibility of a very small amount of dye getting into an extremely limited area of subcutaneous space and producing ecchiomosis there-in?

{"Question": "Ok I will do the blood pressure checks, how often?", "Free_form_answer": "The frequency at which you should measure your blood pressure depends on various factors such as age and medical conditions, and it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider. According to the American Heart Association, measuring your blood pressure twice a day, in the morning and late afternoon, is recommended.

Question Ask: when should a child be evaluated for strabismus? Answer Yes, we should evaluate a young child showing signs of stragismus such extreme irritability and poor vision or posture. If the parents report these symptoms we need to refer the child for evaluation or if the symptoms are noticed by us. Also, it would be wise to evaluate children for refractive error prior to admission to kindergarten or school, in order to prevent possible development of lazy eye. The eye examination should be done once yearly until the age of 6 years, and every  six  months thereafter till the children complete  fourteen  years. This is mentioned in Table 4 . Please add here the information regarding night myopia as described in  the reference No. 7. I would also like to add something similar for day time myopathy. Both these conditions are an emerging problem among the school going children. In the above age group, especially 8 to   thirteen  age-group, cycloplegic refraction is more important as myopic shift is very common. Use of plus spectacles in uncorrected refractions will not solve the purpose. Children need proper correction including the near responses as well in their spectrice.

Most people who lose Weight have trouble keeping it off. If your weight has been very heavy for a long time, setting a goal to loss a small amount of weight (1 to 2 pounds per week) and achieving that goal, may lead to setting and achieve future goals more easily. You may lose some weight by just changing the way you eat or exercise. Make sure to talk to your Health-Care Provider before making any changes in your diet or exercising more. Small changes may actually be all you need to do to reach your goal. Question, is the weight you are at now a healthy weight? Or do you think that you should lose more weight for your height? This is important to consider so you don't set your expectations too high. It takes a great deal of effort to over ride genetics, food addictions, lifestyle choices, and the environment we live in. There is never going to be a one size fits all answer to this question. Only you can decide if you have a weight problem or if your current size and weight is healthy for you. Your job is to make the healthiest choices every day that will get you as close to that healthy Weight as possible. What you weigh is not as important as the lifestyle you choose. And you must choose to accept and love the person you become as you make this lifetime change.

Nursing students often have difficulty distinguishing between \"normal\" febrile responses and potentially dangerous fever elevations, and this can be an important cause of unnecessary antibiotics prescription. Question 7,What happens if you take blood out of the body? The blood becomes fluid, it ceases to circulate, the clotting mechanism stops working and the blood begins to spoil. It is dangerous to make contact with the fluid blood as it can cause infection. In severe cases, where a large quantity of blood is lost, shock sets in resulting fatality.8, What are the causes of road accidents?There are numerous causes, but the biggest one is carelessness. People speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, not following traffic rules and reckless driving cause the majority of accidents. Also, in many cases the roads and poor lighting conditions contribute to the accidents, especially during the night.9, How do they treat road accident victims?First and foremost, they transport the victims to hospital and ensure that they receive the necessary emergency care, i.e. First Aid. Depending on the condition of victims, additional care (eg. Intensive care) might also be necessary.10, Do you have any suggestions to prevent road crashes from happening?The most important thing is for drivers to obey traffic laws. Other measures include improving the road infrastructure and providing adequate emergency response services. As well, educational programs on safe driving and drunk driving are vital. And last but not least, enforcing the seatbelt and helmet use is another important factor in road crash prevention. 11, In your opinion, what should be done to reduce the number of cradle to grave statistics?Improving the emergency medical service, upgrading the pre-hospital care and equipping the ambulances, which in some areas are out-dated, are important factors.

This is because it is difficult to trace the exact time when a patient is infected. The time frame we present reflects the fact that the incubation period of Psa can be quite long. Question ### answer: It is important to note that some of the data about the symptomatic phase of meningitis are contradictory or incomplete. Much of what we know comes from retrospective studies, primarily of HIT meningeal patients, so our ability to draw conclusions is limited. We are encouraged, however, by the prospect of an ongoing, prospective study of NMDA receptor antagonist toxicity in human beings which promises to provide us with better information about this important question. In the meantime, clinicians will have to rely on their own experience and that of others in attempting to decide which patients to put on mechanical ventilation. (Emphasis added by authors). Question 58,Is pyridium the best UTI treatment?\n3.05747Pyridiofurano, which is not a pyrazole-based compound, was the most frequently prescribed medication for UTIs in this study. Further studies regarding the use of pyrodioxol in UIs and lower URTIs are recommended.Pyrazolidine-2-thione was also frequently used in the treatment UUTIs. However, Pyrazol-5-ones and Pyridazones, the compounds most similar to Trimethoprim in structure were not frequently noted for use (Figure 8). It seems that physicians are not using the gold standard of treatment for this condition.The most frequent first line choice for treatment of UIt is FQs followed closely by doxycycline. Flomoxef-floxuridone and nitrofurantoin are also popular choices, especially as second-line agents.Traditionally, Fosfomycin was considered to be reserved for cases of E coli UCI. Recent studies have suggested its use as a first- or second -line therapy. For the remaining FQUIs, nit", "I\u2019d expected it to last longer, or at least not to disappear so quickly?

The external shape of these three areas together with the two eye sockets (orbits), determine the look of a nose. The facial bones (frontal, maxilla and sphenoid bones) which form the hard palate of palpebral fissures (eye-nose distance), is a determinant of nose shape and size.A.The front part of midface (maxilla) together makes the appearance of Tectum olfactorium (sense organ for smell). In the frontal bone, TECTUM OLFACTORM (olfactory cleft) exists. A long ridge (Rhina) separates this from the remaining front section of frontals which give support to the nose the Ethmoids give shape to nose and it's saddles (nasal sill).530,547Is there any specific shape or color of eye that indicates jaundice?No, there is no a specific eye color that indicate jaudice.

The herpeviruses can also cause a condition called dendritic keratin filtration and stromal scarring, both of which can result in a permanently abnormal shape of corneal. Adenovirus can infect the lacrimal duct or conjunctiva and cause pseudocysts. Cytomegalovirusty can likewise provoke inflammatory reaction in these structures. Viruses are not known to directly cause ulcers in human eyes. Rather than directly damaging cells, they cause infection, inflame the affected parts, and eventually lead to scar formation.

However, ophthalmic or facial herpes infection may lead to pseudomembranous or vegetative corneal involvement, or dendritic lesions on the cornea, which may be associated with surrounding leukocytic infiltration . The same viruses that cause chickenpox lesion may also infect the eyes, causing herpetic whitlow or punctate or geographic keratitis. Cytomegalovirus can occur in association with Acanthamosynum. Viruses associated uveitis are VZV, HSV types 1 and 2, CMV and EBV. The inflammation resembles bacterial endophthalmitis but the vitreous is usually clear and no evidence of infection in any other part of the oculomotor system .

Question: 0,How do I get rid of a black eye in 24 hours? \n ### Answer: There is no way to get a bruise in less than 1 day. Bruises are caused by damage to the blood vessels beneath the skin. The damage takes time to heal. In 3 days, the bruises should be completely gone. If the coloration beneath your skin is still black after 7 days or so, you may have blood clotting under there.

Most people on this subreddit have never taken opioids before, only heard about them or have some experience with them from a one-time time try or two. Some of this subs members have chronic pain or chronic illness, and take opiates on a daily basis. And while they have become tolerant and it only takes a certain amount to not feel high or sick, they STILL know what it feels like to NOT have any pain relief, to wake up in withdrawal, etc. If you're at that point in your life, you should probably NOT be taking 600mg of bupropion, this is NOT the withdrawal you want to experience, nor will it help in any way shape or form.

You might include something about how the combination is synergistic in preventing diarhreeal spread but specific for the travellers stomach e.g. only works when all 3 are present in reasonably high concentrations which would only be the case in the GI tract.

Yeah, you shouldn't have both of them shut down if you can help it.B. If they're both shutting down then we need to intubate them to keep them open. We'll put a chest tube in to help keep the lung re-inflated. And then once the kidneurs go, we just let them go. C.

Question: 33,Is bbp a vaccine? \n ### Answer: Some people have a misunderstanding that bacille calmette-guerin (BCG) and hepatitis B vaccine are the same. It would be desirable to clarify this point. Similarly, some people may not understand that while BCG is a vaccination, the bb vaccine is used to treat infection. Also, it would beneficial to add a section on the history of bbe, from its discovery through its cultivation and eventual use for treatment or prevention of TB disease. I would think these sections would generate more interest in reading the article. The authors may also want to include a summary of the current global status of tuberculosis infection and burden as well as a brief overview of treatment and vaccines currently available and in the pipeline. Finally, more recent discoveries on immunology and molecular biology of M. tububerculose would add depth and more current and relevant information to the lay out of this article Question ### answer: Yes. Vaccine is any biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a disease, infection, or chemical intoxication . BCa(bacillus Calmete\u2013Gu\u00e9rin)  is the first successful live vaccinations. In early May 1921, a smallpox epidemy broke out in Geneva, Switzerland; more than 400 persons died, and 270 were sick. At that time, there was no effective way to stop the epidemies.

Question: 51,Should I take ibuprofen with food? \n ### Answer: The ibups (400 mg) generally do not have food requirements whereas the naproxen (50% or 109 mg doses) should be taken with meals. This is critical in my opinion, as the nausea and vomiting that some people experience with Naproxe is reduced significantly by taking with a meal. Most of my patients prefer the Naprolog (1.285 mg/ml) preparation as one can achieve the same 25\u201341 mg Naprog (I take) from only one cc instead of 3 cc\u2019s of a 490 cc (approx) bottle of NAPROX. The naprog is much easier to measure and control. It can also be easily halved (62 cc or so) with no problem to get a lower dose.

Question\u2013 what causes loss in a boys hearing?\u2013what causes hearing problems in babies?-why can babies hear loud sounds but not speech? Question : what can cause a baby to not develop?\n?The development of a child\u2019 s brain (the way nerve cells interact and produce a functional brain) is one of the most complex processes in nature. Several factors can influence this process, from the mother\u20199s body and the environment she provides for the baby, to the genes the child inherits. Often, developmental issues are the result of genetic disorders. But even in cases of \u201cnormal\u201d development, babies may have delays in developing specific skills such as language learning. These delims can be caused by disorders or by factors affecting the brain\u20196s functioning, such a disease, infection, or injury. In other instances, there may be no clear cause. The good news is that, in most instances it may the possible to identify the cause of development delms and provide the appropriate support and therapy to help the babies reach their full potential. (The brain is like a computer, it has limited storage space and processing speed. Thus, environmental factors, genes, and nutrition, all of which affect development).

Inner ear damage can occur with several conditions including meningitis, measles, mumps, rubella, and meningoencephalitis. Outer ear infections, like simian immunodeficiency virus, can also cause hearing loss. This should be mentioned and should not assume that all hearing losses are due to inner earth infection.

(Personal communication, anonymous) Question Question and Answer (AA): Treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is mostly focused on the relief of pain, although this may not remove the cause of menstrual pain. Secondary dysmentorrhia requires treatment of any underlying pelvic pathology. Over the counter (OTC) pain relievers such as ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin (in low doses, e. g., 81 or 325 mg) should be the first line of therapy when treating menstural pain as they will also help to relieve inflammation. Muscle relaxants and prescription strength non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID\u2019s) may also provide some additional relief. A prescription for these drugs may require a pretreatment U.S. guided pelmentery examination to document the absence of adnexal-midline structures. Prescription strength analgesics may be considered for those patients who do not adequately respond to OTC therapy, pel mentery U/S documented absence  of midline ad nexal structures, or if an acute pain attack must not be delayed to obtain a prescription.

While it may be a bit of a fine point, the only place I can think of where the timing has any real ramifications is with respect to the possibility of post exposure prophylaxis. If one were to follow the \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d philosophy, one would argue that the first few days of diarreaha would still require contact precautions because shedding during this time may still pose possibility for the virus to spread.

I must first see a physician or go to the emergency room.90,I must not take this medication if, in addition to being allerggic, if someone in my household is also allergc.The above information on the possibility of drug allergies is common sense; however, it becomes an issue when the individual believes he or she knows better or has experienced a negative incident and in rejecting medical opinion, puts others at risk of serious illness or death. It is surprising how many people have no knowledge of what a real and pseudo allergy is or comprehend the ramifications of misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis.

If the rashes are more red and swollen, it might be allergic contact dermatitis.

{"Question": "So the Flonase is an anti inflammatory?", "Free_form_answer": "Flonase is a medication designed to relieve allergy symptoms. Typically, when referring to Flonase, people talk about the nasal spray containing the active ingredient Fluticasone. Fluticasone is a type of Corticosteroid that helps reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels. Corticosteroids like Fluticasone block the initial stages of inflammation, such as vasodilation, vascular permeability, and leukocyte emigration, and decrease the amount of inflammatory cells and cytokines. It's important to note that Flonase is also a brand name for tablets containing an antihistamine like chlorpheniramine maleate or triprolidine. While antihistamines have some anti-inflammatory effects, they are not considered anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids or NSAIDs.", "Must_have": ["Flonase is a brand of medications intended to relieve allergy symptoms.", "  Flonase commonly refers to the nasal spray containing the active ingredient Fluticasone.", " Corticosteroids inhibit initial inflammatory events such as vasodilation, vascular permeability, and leukocyte emigration.", " Fluticasone is a type of Corticosteroid.", " Fluticasone (Flonase) have anti-inflammatory activity"], "Nice_to_have": ["Antihistamine drugs hold anti-inflammatory effects, but are not considered as anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids or NSAID's.", " Under the brand name Flonase, tablets containing an antihistamine active ingredient such as chlorpheniramine maleate and triprolidine are also sold.", " Fluticasone propionate (Flonase) is mainly used as a nasal spray.", " Corticosteroids directly decrease the presence of inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines.

I would think it would be a great drug to use in COPD patients to help with the inflammation. Question: how to stop taking trazodone?\n?  \n### Answer 1. TrazodONE is a H1-antihistamine with sedating properties. It is not a true antidepressant. The half-life of trazedone is 6-8 hours. If you have been taking TRAZODONE for a long time, you may need to taper off the medication before stopping it completely. This will prevent withdrawal symptoms. To tapers off TAZEDONE, start by taking half of your regular dose. After a week, switch to taking a quarter of the regular dosage. Continue tapering the doses until you are taking only a small amount of TazedonE (for example, less than 75 mg per day). Then, stop the medicine. 2. When tapered off correctly, what is the success rate for stopping Tazedone completely? The success rates are not known. However, the tapering method described above is recommended by the manufacturer. You should talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you feel withdrawal effects. They may be able to prescribe a short course of antihisamine to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.3. What is sedation? Sedation is when you experience a calm, relaxed state of consciousness. Sedating medications are often used to induce sleep, but not all sedative medications will make you sleepy. In this case, sedated means that you remain in control of things like your behavior and your level of alertness, while feeling a calming, relaxing effect.4. Is Trizol a good sleep aid? Tizol is approved by FDA for the treatment of insomnia. But it is prescribed less for insominia and more for depression. So, it may not be the best OTC sleep medicine, however, if it helps you to sleep better, then it works.5. Can you take Tap water with Tiazid? Yes, tap water is fine.6. How long does it take for Tia to leave your body? It should be out of system in 48-72 hours, so it should not show up", "Because I think you need that to help with the swelling.

Question ### answer: [4,156,What is the maximum amount of grapefruit juice that is considered safe to drink in a day? (this one was asked by a friend)?; (1) Yes, but he had only a glass, and he was wondering whether he could have another one. (2) No. My answer was based on the little information I had at the time and the fact that he felt OK after the first glass. I know better now. So, in fact, it was an unnecessary worry on my part and, although it didn\u2019 t turn out terribly, not very good advice either. The point being that it is very difficult to predict consequences in particular situations, because they depend on so many variables\u2014what medications other than clopidogrel are people on, how much grapevine they drink, what part of the tree the component isfrom, etc. In fact it may well be one of those things where the only way to know what happens is to monitor what people report, after they\u2019ve tried it. People\u2019r bodies metabolise drugs at different rates, so the half-life of drugs in their bodies will be different. Likewise for grapemthine. It may even be also affected by interaction with other components of their diet. Also, the graphefruit itself may not be the same in terms of amount or types of compounds in it\u2014depending on how ripe, variety etc Question : is pepto Pepto peptobismol ? \u2016 peptic ulcer ????\n?

Most levodopa carbidopamine is 25 mgr levoprocaine and with 6x a day doses you would be around 8-32-8 mges aday which would put you at the lower range but still higher than what is listed.

Question: 32,What are the 4 stages of Lyme disease? \n ### Answer: Answer 2 stages if BORRELIA is detected in the bloodstream: Early localized infection (properly named \"skin erythema\" or \"erytherma chronicum multiforme\") and \"disseminated infection\" (this term is used rarely nowadays). Question 8,How do you get Lymphoedema? Answer \"If I develop lymphedema, what is the cause?\" \"Why do I have lypmhedea?\" These questions arise from the general public's lack of knowledge on the causes of lumpy skin conditions. The cause of some forms of \"elephant\" flesh - for example, certain infectious causes - should be evident (e.g. a characteristic \"mealy\" appearance after infection by Pseudocercospora litchi, as was reported in some lime trees and Guangxi limes in China) . In other cases, there may be an apparent lack or absence of form or structure, yet \"feeling\" the lump (mass) under the skin \"raises\" suspicion (sense of uneasiness, discomfort, seeing/feeing something that does not belong or is out of place). If a lumps is not painful, patients may have difficulty seeking help, and may only present when the condition has worsened. When questioned, the patient may reply that the \"lump\" has always been present.

(the box says not to). Question: what does it feel like to have reactive arthritis\n?\n\n### Answer : A. It feels like joint pain that worsens with activity and is relieved by rest.B. Reactive Arthiritis is a misnomer. There is no reactivity in patients with ReA as occurs in other rheumatologic diseases such as rhesus disease, SLE, and ANA. Thus although patient\u2019s may report \u201cflares\u201d \u2013 a transient wyses of joint symptoms (ie, pain, swelling, warmth ) there is neither a biologica nor serologiacl basis for inflammation. Hence reaccurent joint inflmation doesnotnecessarilyoccur. In fact it is challenging to demonstrate joint swell ing in Re A patients even in the early stages of the illness. C. Patients with reacitve arhtrits report that painful joints feel heavy and stiff, as if they were made of lead. The pain is described as aches, throbs or grating sensations. D. Some patients describe \u2018doing away\u2019 or \u2018deforming\u2019 of their bones as they assume the affected joint will be permanently damaged. E.

Thank you so much Question the first and last names of all medications and the brand names should be listed. This is critical information and many individuals are unable to read the instructions, let alone follow them.

For example, \u2018take half pill at bedtime\u2019 how did the provider determine that half is appropriate?

Question : 2,Would a whitestring connecting the abscessed area to the skin surface be considered purulent? Please provide an explanation of your reasoning. If you disagree, what is a feature of an abnormal wound that indicates the presence of purulence? Would you reclassify this case as an \u201calmost abcess\u201d? If yes, why? (Additional file 3)Is the hairy appearance of the whitiesring typical for an infected wound? Is this feature a cutaneous manifestations of infection in other places than the examined wound. (For example: furuncles, cellulitis, etc.)In the case of skin abresions - especially on the face - the detachment of epidermis and dermiss is most often adheasive, infections of hair follicules contribute significantly to this process. In general, purpleness, edema, hyperthermia and local pain are signs of inflamation. Suppuration (a.k.a pustule, furuna, carbuncle, verrucas, necrosis, cyst, elephantsias, or just \u2018infection\u2019) represents the most indicative sign for the infection.In addition, the size of this purse-string abbyss is indicitive of how long the process of formation has already taken root. We can assume that the purulation process has ended once a pus-filled cavity has formed.The process described above is highly similar to that of furanucle formation on other parts of body, most notably the armpits, where the hairs are deeper and the folicullar orifice is larger than on glabrous skin. On the contrary, on faces and other glAbsses, sweating plays a significant role in purpuration, especially when associated with occlusive dressings or aphtherma, a fact which has therapeutic implications as well: Hyperthera 19,Sepsis.Hyper-thermo 99 48,Pus 66 76,Infl", "### Answer: Is the active ingredient budesonide or beclomethasone?

Question 75,What does muscle spasm feel like? \n### Answer 1.1 (2)Muscle spasms are episodes of involuntary muscle contractions, which are often painful, and can cause uncomfortable pressure in the affected area. They can occur as a result of overstretched muscles, from being in a tense position, or from nerve stimulation. Muscle Spasming Pain: 45.0 (11)The pain caused by muscle cramps can be severe and may feel as though your muscles are being stretched beyond their limit. It can result in temporary weakness. If the spastic muscle is located near a joint, it may force the joint into an uncomfortable position. Location of Spasm: I.7 (9)A muscle or group of muscles that are in spASm may include: hamstrings, quadriceps, calfs, glutes, back, chest, arm, abdominal, face musclesI.8.2 (8)Sustained abnormal muscle activation that results in visible, palpable, auditable (crackling sound), or tactile (vibrations) and felt by the subject as tension, knotting, pressure, jerking, pinching, cramping or painful stimption.I (all) 69.9 (30)What is the difference between a sprain and a strain?A: Sprains are injuries to muscles or ligaments, while strains involve tendons.B: There is no difference, they are the same injury.C: A sprains occur in excess.D: The injuries are severe in sprained muscles.O (total) Question. how do u know if U got urethral pain?###answer 31 59What sort of pain are you experiencing?41Urether pain is sharp and stab", "That is important to know in clinical medicine, not sure how many health care workers would grasp that the test is non-reactive but the patient still has active hepatitis A. This is where I would put the warning label, a hematology technologist or medical laboratory scientist would know what this means but I am not convinced that our clinical colleagues are aware of this.

It seems that they are mixing up reactivity and specificity. I think they meant that a transient IGM response could be a reaction to an infection of a cross-reacting antigen. That would make sense since they found the IGG response to be specific for HAV. Also, Hepatitis A usually causes a more serious illness then the others. Question Question 2,Is Hib a serious disease? \n ### Answer: Yes, type b Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) is a very serious bacterial infection that can cause meningitis, pneumonia, and other serious complications in young children. H. influenz types other than type c cause milder forms of these diseases. The CDC recommends 5 parenchymal vaccines for children 19-35 months old, with the HBV vaccine given as 3 doses, a minimum of 6 weeks apart; the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) given at 8 days and 7-14 days; \u22653 HRV dosesh; DTaP given instead of Td with each HRMV dose; and HSV at least 4 weeks after the birth dose. With the exception of HEV, these vaccinations are recommended regardless of other risks. Other vaccination schedules may be used in special situations on a case-by-case basis with consultation with a pediatrician or the local health department. However, children who received HEPB and at <24 months of age are at increased risk for getting HIB. If HSP is suspected, antibiotics should be administered immediately with coverage of bacteroides per protocol. Children with severe disease or infection with type 0 or typec HI should begin medical care at home, be evaluated within 90 min and sent to the P", "I was under the impression that the IgM would bind and that would give it a positive result.

Question: 0,How do I get rid of a black eye in 24 hours? \n ### Answer: The best way to reduce the appearance of your black eyes is to apply ice to the area as soon as possible. This will help to constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling. You can also try over-the-counter eye drops that contain allopathic ingredients such as arnica or cucumber extract. These will further help with blood vessel constriction and can provide some pain relief. It is important to avoid heat at this stage as this will increase swollen and may increase the risk of bruising. If you have a lot of pain or the discoloration does not subside within 48 hours, you may have suffered more than a simple bruise and should consult a medical practitioner. 1,What is the best treatment for a concussion?

Question, what makes cyclosporine an immunosuppressant? # Answer - Cyclosporin A is 1 of a group of related compounds, called cy closporins, which are derived from fungi of the Beauveria genus. Cyclophilins are enzymes found in all types of cells, including T lym b cells and anti-CD20 antibodies. By binding to cyclophili ns, cy climosuprrin blocks the normal function of these enyzmes and reduces the body\u2019s ability to launch an effective immuno response. The primary target of cyclosedorin is T cells in the urnalinate portion of mucosal associated lguoid tissue, where the T cell activation and proliferation are the key events in m uclosome-mediated rejection (MR). In addition, cyclo- sporine also has direct anti CD 40 ligand effect on TNF-\u03b1 bearing lgB blasts Question and Answer to what extent does cychlospori i n A impair the activity of cyclobenzap rine p 509254112194 Question 0,What makes people gain weight suddenly?

It belongs to a group of drugs called sedatives and is typically used at low doses. Ambien works by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GAB is the body's major inhibitory neurotrasmitier and a regulator of sleep.Ambien will generally be prescribed for short-term use. However, it is important to note that Ambiens effects can be cumulative. This means that even if you only take it for a short time, if it' s combined with alcohol or other drugs, or taken multiple times a day it can add up and increase side effects. Question: 67,Have you heard about Ambient Air pollution?\n? If not, let me explain.Air pollution comes from several sources such as factories, power plants, motor vehicles, and other human activity. When these sources release their pollutants into the air, they interact with wind, sunlight, moisture, chemical, biological processes, etc. to form various kinds of air polluti ons. On the other hand, pollution also comes by simply burning of fossil fuels for energy in our home and facto ries. The pollution can travel long distance from their source region from rural to urban areas, even across national borders. Air pollu tion not only occurs in urban and industrial areas but also occurs at natural environments such lakes, forests and oceans by human activities. In fact, air pollution has become a global problem now. There are so many harmful effects of ambient air p olutionon human health. For example, breathing pollution can cause a range of issues from allergies to cancer. Polluted air can damage your lungs, making it harder for you to breathe. Long term effects include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. People with existing respiratory conditions, such aCOPAD, are at the highest risk, but it also affects people who have no pre-existing conditions.68,69 Question Answer Question (21) 23,46, (64)What is Ambulatory management of glycemia in diabetic patients ? 5763 (41\u2013600)33"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5185, "rouge1_r": 0.0714, "rouge1_f1": 0.1256, "rouge2_p": 0.0943, "rouge2_r": 0.0128, "rouge2_f1": 0.0225, "rougel_p": 0.3148, "rougel_r": 0.0434, "rougel_f1": 0.0762, "bleurt": 0.3022, "bert_score_p": 0.7849, "bert_score_r": 0.8251, "bert_score_f1": 0.8045, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1234}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4259, "rouge1_r": 0.0648, "rouge1_f1": 0.1125, "rouge2_p": 0.0377, "rouge2_r": 0.0056, "rouge2_f1": 0.0098, "rougel_p": 0.2593, "rougel_r": 0.0394, "rougel_f1": 0.0685, "bleurt": 0.2847, "bert_score_p": 0.7776, "bert_score_r": 0.8177, "bert_score_f1": 0.7971, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.1232}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3519, "rouge1_r": 0.0657, "rouge1_f1": 0.1108, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.2037, "rougel_r": 0.0381, "rougel_f1": 0.0641, "bleurt": 0.2453, "bert_score_p": 0.7589, "bert_score_r": 0.8099, "bert_score_f1": 0.7836, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1359}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4074, "rouge1_r": 0.0603, "rouge1_f1": 0.105, "rouge2_p": 0.0189, "rouge2_r": 0.0027, "rouge2_f1": 0.0048, "rougel_p": 0.2963, "rougel_r": 0.0438, "rougel_f1": 0.0764, "bleurt": 0.2836, "bert_score_p": 0.7642, "bert_score_r": 0.8162, "bert_score_f1": 0.7893, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1205}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3333, "rouge1_r": 0.0608, "rouge1_f1": 0.1029, "rouge2_p": 0.0377, "rouge2_r": 0.0068, "rouge2_f1": 0.0115, "rougel_p": 0.2222, "rougel_r": 0.0405, "rougel_f1": 0.0686, "bleurt": 0.2686, "bert_score_p": 0.756, "bert_score_r": 0.8225, "bert_score_f1": 0.7879, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.1337}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.078, "rouge1_f1": 0.135, "rouge2_p": 0.0566, "rouge2_r": 0.0087, "rouge2_f1": 0.0151, "rougel_p": 0.2222, "rougel_r": 0.0347, "rougel_f1": 0.06, "bleurt": 0.3181, "bert_score_p": 0.7837, "bert_score_r": 0.8406, "bert_score_f1": 0.8111, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.1226}]}

You can also try massaging the area to improve blood circulation. However, for a large or painful bruising, it may take a week or more to disappear. Question ### answer: If you have a busy schedule, you may want a quick fix. There are many topical treatments available that claim to speed up the healing process.

Question: 42,What type of rash is this? \n ### Answer: A red, scaly, or flaky skin r ash is usually caused by psoriasis or eczema, while a red and scaled skin lesion often indicates pityriasis rosea. Question not answered Question 8 ,Why do antihypertensive drugs cause edema? A.The antioxidant tinged CCBs, such as nifedipine and amlodipne, induce cellular oxidative stress, triggering the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways that increase vascular permeability, thereby causing edematous conditions . Also, CVD patients often have edemic states because of elevated endothelin levels , which are counteracted by nitro-type anti-hypertensives such nitroprudil . These nitrate drugs, however, increase sodium reabsorption in renal tubules and promote fluid accumulation . Besides, RAS inhibitor (ACE-I)  also has a similar effect, with added salt excretion hindrance. The non-RAS ACE-IIh blockers, which increase oxygen availability in endothelial cells, are associated with edeme formation , although they are generally not as edemanforming as the C CBs. These antiedema properties of the RAAS-inhibitors might be beneficial in organ protection, particularly in kidney and brain, during acute disease scenarios . Rising blood urea and creatinine levels, usually accompanied by a edemaging tendency, is often observed in CKD patients on R AS inhibitors  but as this often goes hand in hand with better BP control, the benefits usually outweigh the risk in these patients, especially in proteinuric patients.

Question: how often should you weigh in if trying to lose weight? and at what time of day - preferably at the same time everyday? i noticed sometimes if i am off a bit, even only 1 or 2 lbs i feel out of sorts, is this normal? do heath patterns play a role? im just wondering if this is normal for people trying lose weight and is that reason for gain - maybe weight fluctuation? ### Answer: The time-of-day for your weigh-ins may be contributing to your weight gain, or lack thereof. The best time to weigh yourself is first thing in the morning, as this will give you the most accurate measurement and help you to see your daily/weekly progress. If you are weighing yourself at night, you may want to consider drinking a glass of water or going for a walk before you get on the scale to help increase your overnight water loss, which can lead to lower daily weights. It is also best to avoid weighting yourself immediately after exercising, drinking, eating, taking laxatives, using muscle relaxants, consumption of alcohol, urinary/bowel movements, menstruation, food retention, emotional stress, change in position, blood pressure, breathing pattern, constipation or diarrhea, changes in carbohydrate, protein or fat intake, and gain in muscle mass or fluid retation. Also, it is good to measure yourself in similar clothes. (https://www.goodtherapy.org/how-to-lose-weight-10-easy-ways-30549.html) Question your symptoms are associated with a viral infection.

Once a good response is seen, and the inflammation is controlled, the patient can often be switched to once-a-day application of gentamicin sulfate 2% ophthalmic. On occasion, patients will only need to use over-the-counter ointment, such as mineral oil or bepanthen, lid ocular to keep the eyelids soft and prevent watering and dryness. Infection should be ruled out in these patients before switching to discontinuation of the steroids and starting the anti-fluctuation drops.

Antimalayrial drugs cause inner ear toxicity and outer ear APR.12,0380526Can I use anything besides antibiotic ear drops to treat an ear infection?In the event of bacterial otitis media, antibiotics are still the gold standard. If your doctor suspects a viral cause of your pain, antiviral medications such has aciclovir or famcicloid may instead be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness and reduce the severity of symptoms. Question: Can I try antibiobtics at home for 24-48 h and see if symptoms improve before going back to the doctor? (16.3 %)Very Good. You are advised to consult your family physician if the symptoms do not improve within the aforesaid period. Good clinical judgement is imperative-considering all the clinical factors including the patient\u2019s history, condition and the evolution of their illness.22Very good. Consultant with clinical experience in management of Mastoiditis will have a different approach, considering multiple factors like clinical features of presentation, and local practice parameters which may not be applicable to all situations hence the need to review patients on an individual case basis.Incorporate the concept of \"shorter duration antibacterial therapy, if responding well\". This has been a concept that was demonstrated in previous studies of otogenital mucosal conditions such urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infection, etc. In fact, there are ongoing studies that looked at the possibility of shorter duration therapy for mastoid infection as well (Pamplona 751) . Question Question:-50,What causes backache?-7,Can Backache be cured?33 Question 69 \u201cEye injury and how to deal with it\u201d Question : 00 How do I know if my child has o", "### Answer: There are several things you can do. One is to have your ears checked often. If water is the problem, don't put anything in your ear. And, it's best not to use a cotton swab as it can push wax into your eardrum. 5 , 6 , Ask your health worker about other causes. It could be that the disease you currently have causes ear, nose, and throat symptoms. These are called \u2018upper respiratory tract infections\u2019. If you have any of the following conditions: long-term ear problems, a ruptured eARD, or a hole in the earmembrane, these can also cause ear-related problems. Question: 72,Is earwax buildup the same as ear wax build-up? Can the two be distinguished? Are there differences between the middle and inner ear? I find this all quite confusing. I have a feeling that ear in infection is often muddied and difficult to distinguish from ear worm build up with possibly a small amount of wax causing discomfort and resulting in ear infection and so on. Should there be more clarification or are there established methods to tell the difference? In the diagram, how were samples taken; it is quite interesting that in two cases the samples were from a different site (inner or middle ear). It would appear important to establish if there is any relevant difference in site from which wax samples are extracted and whether this adds to the confusion. The method of extracting wax and the cause of each of these samples should be clearly stated. Whether the procedure for one ear is done similar to that of an individual with wax block similarities must be established. In view of this, the article must also include a clarifying comment on this. How each sample was extracted also should give an exact site \u2013 was this from deep inside the canal or from the drumhead or was it a mixture?. The site of collection and how this was achieved must have added to this confusion and should now be clarified in a comment by the authors.

What does it look like? Is it a physical object or a virtual one? How is it organized? Question3 ###answer: Is the genomic information stored in DNA or in RNA? If it is stored only in the DNA, then the RNAs are only intermediaries that faithfully replicate the genetic information and are themselves devoid of any informational content. If, however, the information is also stored, at least partially, in functional RiboNucleic Acids (RNAS), then these molecules become important players in evolution and must be considered as major players, if not the major ones, among the components of the living cell. The question is important but cannot be answered here in all its implications. I will just mention that there are several lines of evidence indicating that RIBOS (the RRNA-polymerase II transcripts) are also codifying (in addition to the classical genes) for peptides and proteins, some of which are involved in cellular signaling and regulation. These peptoRIBOs (for RIBOsomic proteINS) may be the interpreters of a \u201chidden\u201d genoma (or genoMORPHe), which is embedded in and can thus be inferred from the known genOME. This genMorphe would be a gen", "### Answer: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative agent of geninal wart. Genital contact with an infected person transmits the virus.

However, treatments aiming to reduce their number and symptoms are: 1) topical application of podophyllin, 2) trichloroacetic acid, or 3) cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. Invasive treatment with laser or electrocautery is used for large, widely spread, and treatment-resistant condlyomas, but they have a higher risk of recurrence.A.3,How should I protect myself from genitals wot?1.0.Males should use condoms or abstain from sex with infected women or girls.

Question: 8,How do I know if skin redness is serious? \n ### Answer: You mentioned that the rash was not a fever. So, it is a separate event. Have you considered that it might be an allergic reaction caused by a new soap? It could be serious, although it looks mild. Perhaps the host, manager, or bartender would have access to an EpiPen. Question ### answer: I have only seen one reference to allergies in bars, in a restaurant manager forum, and it was a query about how to tell if a customer had food allerges and what to do if they didn't have an action plan in place. But I really think you're on to something. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve been to a bar where the bouncer/doorman was also the chef/bartendar. In some cases, the same person is both. If the allergens are in the food, then the risk is with the person, not the establishment, right? So it would make sense to me that any policies would be determined by the individual and communicated to the staff (who likely have very little knowledge of what they could or couldn' t offer.) Question : 9,Why do my ears hurt when I swallow?2.29E + 09 7.82E \u221210 Is the cause of the pain mechanical or chemical?If it's mechanical, maybe TMD.

They had the classic description of seeing the light and all that. Sometimes they find out about this (they are resusitated after sometime and regain consciousness) and sometimes they don't. The ones that do, always, without fail describe the most beautiful, calming, reassuring, amazing light. It's always a similar description. My mother, as best I remember, told me this story of her NDE. So beautiful. Anyway, I don\u2019t know why I was thinking of it today, but today for some reason I felt calm a lot of the times, even in the face of potentially anxious situations. I still feel calm. Even with a storm coming in (I can feel it coming). I think about being calm and I am. This happens when I meditate a bit. Does any of this sound familiar? What happens? Question: 60,What causes prolonged fever without signs of infection? \n ### Answer: It is not so much that the fever causes the symptoms, it is rather that a fever is a stress for the body. A fever however, can also be helpful to fight an infection. Therefore, fever occurring with an illness is neither good nor bad; it depends on the context. If someone has a severe infection, the high temperature may make the illness worse; if someone is recovering from an illnes, a temperature can be supportive, helping to overcome the infection or other causes of illness.

{"Question": "What does a low pulse possibly indicate?", "Free_form_answer": "It is normal for an adult to have a pulse rate of 60-100 beats per minute (bpm). If the pulse rate falls below 60 bpm, it is known as bradycardia (low pulse). Bradycardia can be a normal physiological response in healthy individuals during sleep, endurance athletes, and older patients.

Certain drugs like calcium channel blockers, lithium, opioids, and beta blockers can also cause bradycardia.

{"Question": "What does proton pump inhibitor do ?", "Free_form_answer": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications that suppress the production of stomach acid. They work by inhibiting an enzyme in the cells of the stomach wall, which controls acid production.

They work by blocking the cells in the lining of the stomach that produce acid, reducing the amount of acid made and relieving symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and chest pain. PPIs are also used in combination with other medications to protect the inside ofthe stomach from damage caused by excessive acid production. Question: what is the difference between a cold sore and herpes? ### Answer 1. Cold sores are causedby the herpex simplex virus, while herpetic whitlow is causedbymultiplication of this virus in skin cells.2. Herpes is a chronic infection that recurs with exposure to stressors, whereas cold soreshave a more limited duration.3. The clinical manifestations of herpessimplex include vesicles, blisters, and soresa on the skin or mucous membranes, which are not seen in coldsores.4. Treatment of cold sowers with antiviral medications can reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, but this is not the case for herpatitis.5. Serological testing for the presence of antibodies to the virus that causes herperthesis can be used for diagnosis, as well as for monitoring the progression of infection. This isnot possible in cases of a simple viral infection, like a common cold.6. While both cold and chickenpox viruses are from the same family of virusthe corneal lesions in chicken pox are different from those in her petus.7. In cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty, it is important to perform a viralgene test to confirm the diagnosis.8. It is possible to have a herptical whlow without a fever, so it\u2019s important not to rely solely on fever as a diagnostic symptom.9. A cold that lasts more than 7 days or is severe may be a sign of bacterial pneumonia, especially in young children, the elderly, or those with weakened immune systems.10.

The word \u201cradiculates\u201d means \u201cbranch out.\u201d Thus, radicles branch out from the vertebral column into the spaces within the spine. Nerve roots are composed of axons (nerve fibres), which carry both afferent (sensory) and efferenta (motor and autonomic) messages between and within reflex arcs. In each intervertebal disc, the nerves roots enter the inter vertival space from either side of the disc. They then pass through the neuroforamina to the medial side to leave the canal as the exiting nerves. Both entrance and exit nerve traffic to and from all nerves are protected within all these spaces. Question: 04,Is cushing syndrome fatal?\n?05, Is cromoglycate anti-inflammatory drug?

Cervicals are smaller in size than the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae. They are located between the skull and the first th thoriac verthebra. The cerves are numbered C1 to C7. Each cerve has transverse foramina through which the nerve roots pass. There are also paired, large, round ligaments connecting the cerebella and ceves. In front of c7, these ligamens merge to form a long and thick ligament, the anterior longitudinal ligand. Lateral to this ligature are the facet Joints. Behind the vertrebra are small openings, called the posterior transversal foraminea, through whichthe epaxial muscles receive their nerve supply. These openins are surrounded by a network of small blood vessels named the vasa nervova. Lying anterior to the transveral processes of C3 to 7 are three groups of muscles,these are referred to as the scalene, anterior, and posterior group. Moving laterally from the median line they are; the longuscolli, sternothyroids,and the thyrohyoids muscles. Between C2 and C6 are embedded the nerves to these paraspinal musculessome of which branches out to supply movement to lower airway, extensor muscles of lower limbs, biceps, brachiocephalic arch, bronchi and trachea. Above C5 are paralaryngeal space, visceral and laryngial branches of recurrent lARYNGeal Nerve. Below the C 6 level lies the prevertebral retropharyrngeall space in which a plexus of nerve fibers emerges. Branches originating from this pleyus enter the lymph nodes. At the entry of this space the upper boundary is formed by the lateral pharynx assemblage and at the lower boundary it is drawn by cuff of mucosa of vagus nerve. Question: Are you sure? I found these to be different: Your criteria were not clear. For example, C cephalgias in your criteria only included tension-type headaches", "Cervicothoracic junction syndrome, also called upper crosstermal junc tion syndrome (O-C1-2 Junction), is a clinically significant combination of neurological and/or mechanical manifestations within the c7-T1 region that may result from dysfunction of the articulation, soft tissues, and vascular structures; the junctions of C1\u20132 and C2\u20133 may also be involved. Question: 7,What diseases are caused by fungi? \n ### Answer: Some of these diseases may lead to a fatal outcome.13 In addition to the skin, fungal infections may spread to body tissuess  and cause diseases such as aspergillosis  pulmonology, gastroenterology and other diseases [84\u201386]. Fungal in respiratory and gustatory system can have serious effects on health. Aspergiillus and Peniclium species which are frequently inhaled by patients with pulmoon diseases, cause respotatory diseases . Fusarium oxysporum which infects the human vairtiales causes Gastroinstestinal disorders . Question Question 8,Will a brain tumor be detected on a routine MRI scan?Most likely not.An MIR scan is not sensitive enough to detect a small brain tume. However, if you have a large brain mass, it will be visible on MRF.9,If you find a lump in your brain, should you cut off a piece of it and bring it to hospital for the doctors to examine?No, this will cause brain death. Cutting off and bringing a part of brain to test is an option in some other disease conditions, but not in this case. This option is only for those who are seriously ill with large space-occupying lesion in the brain that presses on the vital parts of your brains.

Question : What are the uses for the medicine metformin hydrochloride? Do you take this medicine for diabetes? If you have diabetes, when did you start taking metfomin? What does mettomin look like and what does it taste like? Why do they give me metmoin when I have diabetes and not the other medicines what is in them? Can a doctor give a person metfrmin if the person has not been diagnosed with diabetes yet? Have you ever been given metfmoin for pre-diabetic? (If yes then explain.) Question ### answer: Or is it for something else and you just happen to be fat and getting diabetes so you need to change your diet and exercise more. Or maybe its just for lower blood sugar values so it must be for diabetics? Or could it be something entirely different? I am really confused. Maybe its for athletes because it helps lower energy and fat? How would it do that? Would it make you more tired? Your opinion on this matter would really help other people to make their own decision. If your doctor told you to stop exercising and just use metfromin instead of exercizing and using the mettrmin you would probably stop excersising more than half of you all.

How does tizanidine affect the body? \u2022\u2022 Tizinidne is an alpha-2 presynaptic inhibitory motor neuron transporter. By decreasing the cloning of norepinephrine, it reduces the anxiety. \u2022 Tensile strength and retractor strength in muscles were increased by decreased cloned nociceptive substances. This showed that tiazidene reduced the contractile force of muscle fiber by inhibiting the transmission of pain impulses. The analgesic effect of tizardene was achieved by increasing the pain threshold of injured tissues and reducing the subjective pain sensation by a placebo effect. There was no direct analogy to prove the relationship between analgic and anticonvulsant effect, but the above findings revealed that the analgetic action of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagnoist like TMS or MK-801 and tacrines might share common mechanism based on (stim25).

This is especially true if your eye doctor diagnosed you with a condition that affects the surface of your cornea. It is also true in the case of eye injury, during which particles may become embedded in your eyes. In such cases, it is important to seek immediate care at an emergency room.

{"Question": "What is sciatica", "Free_form_answer": "Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the sciatic nerve path due to sciatic nerve injury or irritation. The most common cause of sciatica is compression of the sciatic nerve root by a herniated disc in the spine. Classically, the pain affects one side of the body and radiates from the buttock down the back of the leg to below the knee. The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks. The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated.

Aching pain from buttock to ankle2.35What is the sciatic nerve?A. The nerve that controls the biceps and quadriceps muscles of the thighB/C The sciated nerve is a common entrapment neuropathy, where the lumbar or sacral roots (L5, S1) are compressed as they exit the spinal canal into neurofoam (this is different from cauda equina syndrome where spinae and/or canal roots are involved). This causes symptoms of pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in a distribution compatible with the distribution of nerve fibers for the lumbosacral spines.1.58Is it scanning or scanned?2245.The scans are performed using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computer tomography) scan, with or without contrast medium or injections.919MRI or myelography use a magnetic field to produce pictures of individual sections of a joint or body part. MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography), and MRCP (MR Cholangiogram) produce three-dimensional images of blood vessels and the pancreatic ducts, respectively. CT scan uses a computer and radiation to make detailed pictures inside the body. Myelogram uses x-rays and a special fluid that shows up in every spi-ns they put in. Ultrasound uses sound waves. General MTI (Mitral Testicular Imaging) is an ultrasdound that uses A-mode (B-Scan, brightness of A) and color Doppler for testicular and scrotal pathologies.28,General sonography is used for scroteal sack echinoderma, hydrocele, varicocelectomy with retrograde flow in veins, infertility cases to assess sperogram abnormalities, scrotoinguinal and inguinal region pathology, vasculonodal and epididymo testeal circulation, vascular, genitourinary trauma, filtral eczema, etc.4855142", "Sciatica is a term used to describe pain that radiates from the back into the leg.

Question: 3,How many months are you after your stroke? \n ### Answer: I'm 4 months post stroke. I can't do much by myself anymore. My stroke was pretty bad. People tell me I should be dead but I am alive, but nothing else seems to make much sense. Sometimes I want to end it. How much longer do I have to live like this? Question : 6, How long after brain injury do seizures happen? A. No one knows for sure B. We are not sure. There are no studies that have followed people for more than a few years after the brain injuries and looked for seizure development at that point. Some people develop seizURES very soon after TBI some up to 2 years later. So it is hard to say. But if one had a severe brain stem injury the probability of long term complications, one of them being epilepsy, would be high as the processes leading to epilespy happen immediately. In the case of TBIs or aneurysm rupture, the probabilities of epilpesy are higher within the first year, however, as with all seizepor types, some people experience them late. C. Seizures usually do not happen until after a brain tumor is developed. This is not a true statement as seizudes may and do occur before the tumour can even be noted. However, this does not apply to brainstem tumours as they cause seizutes from early on. D. Most acquired brain injures lead to early development of seizuro types with the chance of late occurrence dropping by half within 5 years. E. Late onset seizuros are more likely to develop into epicles to the person is lead.F. The time period between brain damage and development depends specifically on the type of brain damge, whether traumatic or non-traumatc. G. Secondary brain damages are responsible for the development and late ones.H. Epilespory and nonepilesporv patients are similar in time", "### Answer: Sciatica is a term used to describe pain that radiates from the back into the leg. It is caused by compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve in the body. Sciatic nerves are formed from five individual spinal roots that emerge from lumbar and sacral vertebrae. They exit the spine through small openings (foramina) between the vertralia and the arch of C0, C1 or the transverse process of a vertabrum. The nerves then pass through the foramina and enter the spural canal where they travel through an osseous tunnel formed by the articular processes and laminas of vertraebrae above and below. As they do so, they are named for the corresponding vertaebrum\u2014for example: spina ilio sacra (lumbar); spana ilice sacrum (sacral), followed by a Roman numeral (i.e., Ia, IIa etc.) to distinguish the individual nerve or root. At the lower lumbo sac level, the S1 and S2, roots then divide into dorsal/sensory and ventral/ motor neuros. Shortly after the division, The S-1 nerve root leaves the canal and enters into a short segment of connective tissue which brings it near the dura mater, then it enters the greater scili foramen (or the \u201cnotch\u201d), then joins with a corresponding nerve from sacrococcygeal junction to form the superior part of scariatic, nerve roots II (the smaller roots) join from within to give off branches to the inferior part. Then the nerve divides into anterior and posterior divisions (rami ans) inferiorly at the level of ischial tuberosity, to complete the sacro-tuberous joint and merge into anatomo-functional unit with the hamstring muscles (Bocquet et al. 1987).

The first step in developing a treatment plan is to measure blood BP at home so you have a reference point. Based on these readings, your doctor or pharmacist can determine whether the first line of treatment you are prescribed is too low, too high, or within normal limits. Monitor your blood sugar regularly, as some antihypertensive medications can raise blood glucose. Question: Is vitamin D the same as sun shine? \n ### Answer: The two sources are different but complement each other. Vitamin d is a hormone that is made in the skin, usually when the Skin is exposed to sunlight. This vitd is then stored in fat cells in and is used by the blood bones. If a person is unable to get enough vit d from sunlight the is supplemented with vit. d via the food. It comes from very few other sources, and if the person does not eat enough foods that contain it, then they are usually deficient. Some people wear clothing that covers most of their bodies and do not allow for enough sunlight to reach their skin to make vit a sufficient amount, even if they live near the equator. Other people stay inside in their homes in rooms that are blacked out from the sun and wear long pants and long sleeved shirts even as the season become warm. These people cannot get sufficient vit from being outside for long periods, so they have to eat food that contains a lot of vit in it to keep their vit levels up. So although a vit deficiency can be solved with both exposure to sunshine and eating the right foods, you cannot substitute eating vit-containing foods for the exposed sunlight that makes new vit, a process that occurs outside the foods the vit enters the human body.

Both a voided and a cathetered specimen must be checked microscopically (depending on the appearance of the speculum), and if the voider specimina is positive for nitrites, Leukocyte esterase tests Leucocytes and bacterias must also be examined. A culture of urar samples from infants and young children may not be useful in making a diagnosis since a a UTI may often be asymptomatic in this age group and UTIs are less common in newborns and younger infans.A uralysis is ordered when there is a need fot diagnose or rule out a Urine Tract Infection. It checks for the presence of white blood cells in urinate, as well as for certain chemical markers, such as nitrite and pH. If the uraleysis report is abnormal it is followed by urinea culture to confirm the findings.Urine is collected and analyzed in a specialized pouch called a \"urinary cathedral.\" The collection process is called \"clean catch.\" During the collection, a sterile collecting loop held by a forceps is rubbed firmly inside the opening of to collect a small amount (about 0.5 ml) of mid-stream urina. After the sample is obtained, the bag is twisted closed and labeled with the patient's identification number.In infats, particularly during the first week of life, it may difficult to obtain a pure (sterile) urane sample by the clean catch technique. In such case, obtaining the sae uran Sample through aseptic collection from a non-infected area of thhe urin tract, using a special collection device, is preferable to collecting a sample of uncertain purity from an infected site.The void region of nappies (or diapers) worn by infasts is opened and examined for any moist areas that smells of uar. Nappi moisture is determined by weighing samples on an analog balance before and after drying in an oven for 2 hours at 120 degrees Celsius (248 degrees Fahrenheit", "### Answer: Urinalysisss is a test that examines various characteristics of urin to check for the presence of infection, certain medical conditions or to identify potential health hazards. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is more likely when there is an elevated number of white blood cells in a ur sample. This test also tests for pH, specific gravity (SG), glucose, protein and ketones in the ur. Urine cultures are done when bacteria is seen in ur ur test. Cultures are used to determine what type of bacteria exists and which antibiotics would be most effective for treating the infection.

Please include frequency of voiding and leakage of urin (or incontinence) in data analysis. The study also lacks data on age, gender, history of antibiotic use, previous diagnosis of UTI, lifestyle (for example, sexual activity, dairy or meat diet, smoking), all of which are known to modify the risk of developing UTIs. Without adjusting for these factors - all well-established risk factors for UTP - it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusion from this study. Question: what is urination and is it difficult?\n?  \n > Answer in the second definition, what does it mean difficult urinations?

PCCW, PCQF, RCC, RTFC, SCCQ, SDSC, 7, Question . Do navel or ear infections cause fever? Or are they a sign of an already existing fever due to another infection?Navel/ear infection usually causes fever only if it gets worse and when it has spread to the bloodstream. So, it can be regarded as a fever with a different cause.Fever with different causes can overlap for a period of time. In this overlapping period, the exact cause of fever is hard to determine. Therefore, we should focus on the main clinical symptoms in order to get to know the etiology.Bacteremia refers to blood stream infection, whereby a bacteria which has been colonized in a body cavity, often a urcine cavy or the ear, gains access to or reenters the circulatory system and begins to multiply. This can cause symptoms and mortality if left untreated (this applies to all bacterial infectious).Blood cultures, when indicated, must be done as soon as possible, so that we can find out whether there is bacteremici or not. If there's a bacteremeia, antibacterial therapy should start asap.Bloody ear discharge, fever and headache are signs of acute otitis media (AOM)."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3298, "rouge1_r": 0.1314, "rouge1_f1": 0.1879, "rouge2_p": 0.0538, "rouge2_r": 0.0213, "rouge2_f1": 0.0305, "rougel_p": 0.2021, "rougel_r": 0.0805, "rougel_f1": 0.1152, "bleurt": 0.2459, "bert_score_p": 0.7463, "bert_score_r": 0.8311, "bert_score_f1": 0.7864, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.2618}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4894, "rouge1_r": 0.1631, "rouge1_f1": 0.2447, "rouge2_p": 0.0538, "rouge2_r": 0.0178, "rouge2_f1": 0.0267, "rougel_p": 0.2234, "rougel_r": 0.0745, "rougel_f1": 0.1117, "bleurt": 0.2467, "bert_score_p": 0.7738, "bert_score_r": 0.8484, "bert_score_f1": 0.8094, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.2395}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5106, "rouge1_r": 0.1371, "rouge1_f1": 0.2162, "rouge2_p": 0.1075, "rouge2_r": 0.0287, "rouge2_f1": 0.0452, "rougel_p": 0.2979, "rougel_r": 0.08, "rougel_f1": 0.1261, "bleurt": 0.2763, "bert_score_p": 0.7981, "bert_score_r": 0.8599, "bert_score_f1": 0.8279, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.2422}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4681, "rouge1_r": 0.1533, "rouge1_f1": 0.231, "rouge2_p": 0.086, "rouge2_r": 0.028, "rouge2_f1": 0.0422, "rougel_p": 0.2234, "rougel_r": 0.0732, "rougel_f1": 0.1102, "bleurt": 0.2644, "bert_score_p": 0.7779, "bert_score_r": 0.8658, "bert_score_f1": 0.8195, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334, "fluency": 0.2727}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4043, "rouge1_r": 0.1035, "rouge1_f1": 0.1649, "rouge2_p": 0.043, "rouge2_r": 0.0109, "rouge2_f1": 0.0174, "rougel_p": 0.1915, "rougel_r": 0.049, "rougel_f1": 0.0781, "bleurt": 0.249, "bert_score_p": 0.7764, "bert_score_r": 0.8208, "bert_score_f1": 0.798, "hallucination": 87.5, "comprehensive": 16.666666666666664, "fluency": 0.2169}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3936, "rouge1_r": 0.1111, "rouge1_f1": 0.1733, "rouge2_p": 0.0215, "rouge2_r": 0.006, "rouge2_f1": 0.0094, "rougel_p": 0.2234, "rougel_r": 0.0631, "rougel_f1": 0.0984, "bleurt": 0.2927, "bert_score_p": 0.7831, "bert_score_r": 0.8282, "bert_score_f1": 0.805, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.2271}]}
{"Question": "What is the most common cause of dysuria in young, sexually active, healthy men?", "Free_form_answer": "The most common cause of dysuria in young, sexually active, healthy men is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). STIs can result in inflammation of the urethra (urethritis), epididymis (epididymitis), and prostate (prostatitis). These conditions are associated with dysuria and an urgent, frequent need to urinate. Signs and symptoms of urethritis may also include pain during sexual intercourse and itching at the tip of the penis. Epididymitis usually presents with a swollen, painful scrotum, and prostatitis is associated with pain in the perineum. Discharge from the penis can be a sign of an STI. The most common STIs are gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Diagnostic evaluation typically includes a physical examination, medical and sexual history taking, and urine tests such as urinalysis, urine culture, and urethral swabs.

Question-: Can you give me an example of how a patient might use this app?Pediatric rheumatologist: Sure, sure. A patient, particularly an adolescent patient sees you for the first time. Usually what happens is that you have to explain to them what is going on: this is arthritis, this joint is inflamed, it\u2019s hot, perhaps you can\u2019 t see the inflamanation but trust me, underneath this skin there\u2019 s a lot going out.

Because even by just taking a picture, immediately it takes you to a chart, a flowchart that says what\u2019 it is so I think that\u2019 is really helpful because even MedMal, when I was in Med Mal, we always have those templates. If I were to write fever chart my template will be a bit different from your regular chart so what this does is it provides more of like a guide for people so that they all have the same standard chart for instance Question -: Do anal fissures heal themselves? - As discussed, patients are usually treated conservatively which includes analgesia, sitting at room temperature, elevation of the anal area, but sometimes these home remedies are insufficient. In such situations, other forms of treatment, such as pharmacotherapy or interventional therapy are needed. While the former includes the usage of ointments, lotions, etc., the latter includes botulinum injections, sclerotherapy, fistulotomy and excision. Nevertheless, in most of cases, internal and external anal sphincter injuries heal on their own and the patients do not need interventions.

The results of the survey must therefore be somewhat biased. For more scientific and accurate data, one would need to refer to medical records and conduct interviews. However, the advantage of this approach is that a large number of people can be included in a short period of time and at moderate expense. When compared with other methods, this type of research is both time- and cost-effective.) According to the participants in this survey (N = 225), the term \"dysurIA\" was correctly defined by 57.5% of all participants. In total, 70 response sheets were handed in with one or more of these terms incorrectly defined. On inquiring as to which of several terms used in the definition of \"chronic prostatitis\" (i.e. chronic prostate inflammation, chronicprostatis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome) caused doubt or uncertainty in participants, only the last one (6 responses) was marked.

However, urethal discharr is quite common among younger population. Some hygienic measures such as gentle wiping from front to back after urinating will help reduce such problems. Question: Why does my foot drop?\n\n### Answer 2) Tendon shortening and contracture due to prior ankle injury/deformity/prolonged inactivityTendons are the thick, tough bands that link muscles to bones. After an ankle injury, particularly if it was treated in a cast or boot, the tendons can shorten as the foot is held in an equinus position. This will cause a reduction in range of motion. If the ankel is weakened as well, it can lead to a limp.Treatment for this problem involves exercises to stretch the muscles and tendon. Stretching the calf muscle is particularly important.13 Question:\\I have some questions about my thyroid? Can you help?\\\n- AnswerYes, I would be happy to help. Please let me know your questions and I will do my best to answer them.06,What is Hypothyroidism?The thyroids main function is to control metabolism in our bodies, by releasing hormones into the bloodstream thyrotropin (TSH) and triiodothyronine (FT3) thyroninin(FT4).

Hemificial Microssomica is a disorder affecting the first and second branches of the trigeminal nerve. Treasures-Colin syndrome is disorder that affects the second and third branches", "### Answer: Uropathogenic species are relatively uncommon in healthy young men 2-49. Urethral catheterization, urinary stents/silicone tubing (during or following interventional procedures such as TURP), urine collection devices/bags and sexual practices are more likely to lead to urehral and/or periurethal inflammation and injury, and thus increased tendency to develop dysurnia symptoms 3. It is also common for men to postpone seeking medical attention for MSK-related symptoms, even when they are bothersome. Hence, it is not unexpected that many men suffer from MSI in the absence of lower UTI symptoms32. The fact that these men are not seeking care for their MSP, means they would not be classified as having dysanurria. Thus, the true incidence of MSU may be higher than that reported in this study3..

However, in most cases youshould start to notice a difference within 90 min of taking the tablet, with pain relief that lasts for up  to  an hour. Again, this is just a rough guide,and if you feel any discom-fort after taking ib-up-rof en, you sh-ould stop it and consult your doctor or pharmacist.

It functions by inhibiting the perception of pain by the brain and by anesthetizing the pain signal before it reaches the awareness. There are two main problems for using Tramo in mentral pain relief: First, by reducing pain the Travo also reduces muscle tension \u2013 this is not recommended in case of menstral period pain. Second, the side effects can include nausea. So, if you do use Tramic, take it AFTER the paracetamol has taken effect (this will reduce the naseau effect); in addition, have something with you that helps to reduce any nausaea \u2013 lemon sherbet, crackers, oats, ginger etc. Question- how many hours apart can you take bismol vs imodium?\n?; Answer to taking imo 4 mgs twice a day and bismo 30 cc., is it possible to have both in your stomach at the same time or it's an either or, basis?

Question: What medication ( brand name and dosage ) would be used to treat a muscle spasm in the lower back region also known as the lumbago and what is their mechanism of action and side effects?\n?  \n### Answer 55,There is a general lack of consensus on the best method to use in treating the different types of back pain as well as on which classification system is most appropriate. However, we believe that this issue is beyond the scope of this article. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that medication should only be taken if is necessary and only the amount that is required.In the management of muscular spasms that affect the lumbar region, the medication of choice is often a combination of an analgesic and a relaxation agent. A preparation of butalbital (i.e.,ButalBiteTM) is an example of such a drug combination.Alternatively, dicyclomine (a gastrointestinal prosthetic drug) and mepenzoline (an antihistamine drug), usually in combination, can be administered; however, despite these drugs having been used for decades, they have not been licensed as \"spasm\" drugs.Tenderocular pain: In the absence of headache, ergotamine and methylergometrine are used; in cases associated with headaches, combination analgedics, such as aspirin or indomethacin, are usually used.Dyskinesia: There is no curative treatment for dystonia, but symptomatic management includes anticholinergic drugs, muscle relaxants, neuroprotective agents, GABAA and BzD receptor allosteric modulators. In many cases, botulininum toxin injections, deep brain stimulation, and surgical denervation provide important relief.Atypical antipsychotics and pram", "### Answer: The most safely recommended dose ofAdvil is 400 mg every 6\u20138 h, up to a maximum of 3 g per day.[4, 5] Accordingly, the maximum daily dosage of ibuprofen is also 2.4 grams (3 \u00d7 805 mg tablet).

{"Question": "What should do if I get a fever?", "Free_form_answer": "The average body temperature ranges from 35.3 to 37.7\u00b0C (95.5 to 99.9\u00b0F), and anything above 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F) is typically considered a fever. Fevers are commonly associated with infectious diseases, but can also be a symptom of autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. Treating a fever can help alleviate accompanying symptoms like headaches, muscle and joint pain, or febrile seizures in children. Medications like acetaminophen (paracetamol) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can be used to lower fever. Acetaminophen is usually recommended first due to fewer side effects than NSAIDs, but short-term use of either drug is safe for healthy individuals without kidney or liver impairment.

Question Question \u2013 Do i take the iron supplement at the same time as the calcium supplement? Or what do you recommend? I had read that calciummay interfere with the intestinal absorption of iron. Also it is stated in the supplement that the Iron supplement can be taken together with a \u201ccalcium rich\u201d diet. But in my opinion this statements is confusing as it would contradict the fact that to get the full benefit from a calciumpill you are supposed to drink (a \u201cglass of milk\u201d), or more or less equivalent, with each supplementation. Would be better to clarify this in your supplement. On the other hand, your statement also reflects the common practice of taking such supplements, because nearly all of us belong to the group of persons who do not get enough calciumin from our regular diet as recommended by the Society. Therefore I, as well as I presume most of your readers, take a supplement to compensate this shortcoming of my diet and would be interested in knowing how to combine the different supplementations to serve best our needs.

If you have a low-grade fever (37.8 \u00b0C or below) that persists for less than a few days, it is normally not cause for concern. However, if your body temperature is high (above 38.9 \u00b0 C) or your fever is accompanied by other symptoms such as cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, or fatigue, you should contact your doctor or seek medical attention. In general, adults can safely manage a temperature of about 40 \u00b0F (104 \u00b0 Fahrenheit), but higher fevers should be treated with caution.

A thin, flexible, lighted tube with a small camera is inserted through your rectum and into your colon. This procedure can be used to prevent and detect colon cancer by evaluating the colon lining. During this exam, polyps, which are growths that could be cancerous, are detected and evaluated. In some cases, they may be removed and sent for a biopsy. In addition, colonoscopy may also be used to diagnose other gastrointestinal issues such as chronic diarrhea, bloody stools, weight loss, and abdominal pain.

The risk factors for atherosclerosis and coron-ary artery disease are the same as those for heart at-talks. These include high blood pressure, high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) chol-esterol, diabetes, smoking, and a family history of coronay arter y disease. Yes. Eating a diet low in saturated fat and cholas- terol and high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, is associated with a lower risk. Smoking causes an increase in blood chola-sterol level and reduces the good choler- sterol (HDL cholo-stero) level, both of which are risk factor for coronany ar-tery diseases. Therefore, quitting smoking is beneficial. No. High blood pre-sure is a major risk for CHD, but blood press-ure can be controlled,", "### Answer: The purpose of a gastrointestinal evaluation is to find any signs of lymphoma but also to investigate and treat any GI motility disorders that exist. As part of the exam, a biopsy of any suspected areas of malignancy are taken. The biopies are then sent to the pathology lab for review.

The malignancy might not be seen, even with a biopsy, as early carcinomas are more likely to be located on the surface of a mound of tissue and not in the mukosa proper. A normal colon is expected.Adenocarcinoma of rectum is characterized by a broad spectrum of macroscopic presentations at endoscopic examination, from a small, 1-cm, nodular, sessile, or pedunculated lesion to a large, ulcerated, polypoid or infiltrative mass involving the full circumference of many centimeters in length. Sometimes the entire rectunm is involved and obstructed.32,The findings will depend on where the tumor is located in terms of whether it is more proximal or distal. If progredient and distended, it will be visible on scanning as a mass.4,What might appear as \u201cnormal\u201d on endo could be cancer. What causes this lack of mussae in cancer?Sometimes the whole circumstance will appear normal. Perhaps the area of cancer is small and has been just pushed into the lumen. Or perhaps the mass is so huge it has pushed the wall back. In both these cases the cancer will not create endows. It will just be another mass in rectums.52.21.1 Question: 27,Can Crohn\\'s disease cause a baby to die? \n ### Answer: Yes, Crohns disease can cause rectosigmoid colitis, which in turn can lead to bleeding and swelling of bowel, followed by shock, heart failure, and in some cases, death.

For example, someone who has HIV may be considered immumocompetent with a fully functional immune system, while someone with AIDS may have an immune systems that is unable to fight off certain infections. What causes this spectrum is a complex interaction between the state a person is in with regard to various diseases and in turn how those affect the capacity of a persons immune System. In some situations, immunity is lowered as a result of an underlying disease or infection, whereas in other situations an overactive immune response can lead to damage of immune cells, resulting in decreased function. The interaction of many different factors ultimately determines what constitutes immune competency or immnocompromise at any given time.

Diseases that weaken the immune system include chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory or kidney diseases. Certain medications can also weaker the body's ability to fight off in in several ways. Examples include medications that decrease the numbers of white blood cells (such as as chemo-therapy used in cancer treatment or corticosteroids used to treat allergic reactions), as well as medications metabolized by the liver enzymes, making it harder for the medications to be broken down and allowing more of the drug to interact with the brain.

(Rhino-TUB-Ulitis) inflamm-ation at the junction of nose, brain and tube. 2.1.2AVMs, A. ArterioVenous malform-ations. AVM is a network of abnormal blood vessels that connect feeding arteries directly to draining veins without an intervening capillary network. Thus, there is shunting of oxygenated blood, usually resulting in localized tissue deterioration (\u2018oxygen Steal\u2019). Usually, the brain tissue supplied by these Avm\u2019s is not capable of metabolising the delivered oxygen supply. The tissue is therefore subject to epileptic activity. Cerebral AWM is very often present at birth, although they may become symptomatic only later in life. Most are asymptotic however [35, 36]. A rare form of A-VM in which there a solid core of cap-illaries, vein-ules and tissue interstitium may be associated with inflammatory or tumour type processes.

{"Question": "Whats the difference between Valtrex and Acyclovir?", "Free_form_answer": "Valacyclovir (Valtrex) and acyclovir (Zovirax, Sitavig) are both antiviral drugs prescribed to treat the infections caused by herpes simplex virus, and varicella-zoster virus, which include cold sores, genital herpes, chicken pox, and shingles. Acyclovir is also used to treat herpes in neonates and herpes simplex encephalitis. Molecularly speaking, Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, which is converted into acyclovir in the body. Among other differences is that Valacyclovir is only available as oral tablets, whereas acyclovir is available as oral tablets, oral capsules, sublingual tablets, oral suspensions, creams, and injectable solutions. In addition, Valacyclovir has a longer duration of action and greater bioavailability compared to acyclovir.

Question: 02,What is varus deformity of the knee? \n ### Answer: Varus knee is medial (toward the center of gravity of body) alignment of distal femur and proximal tibia in relation to mechanical axis of leg.It is due to medially placed and/or swollen joints, medically placed or prominent longitudinal ridges on medullary surfaces, and short torsion at distorting knee joint.Varus inclination of knee (also called Varism) is the medical deviation of tarsal axis from the mechanical leg axis.The Varis-Varism distinction is important in clinical settings to define pathology or deviations in anatomical landmarks. Varisi is mal-alignment of lower limb in frontal plane while Varush is deviated orientation of bones and Joints in coronal plane.In varis, knee cap (patella) and lower leg (Tibial) are deviate mediate, while in Varxim, the deviatioon is in bones (Femur in to Meda and Tibial in posterior) Orientation within front cornsome. Thus, in varism, Varish is Varishi. The Varsh is m-shaped malformation of femoral in developmental disorder. It causes abnormal femorotiblal rotation Varuh, varush (Varisi and Varu h meda).

(4) Do I charge the same for a hearing evaluation as I would if the cause of the hearing difficulty was known to be permanent (e.g., prescription of a new hearing aid) vs. if I suspected the problem was transient (possibly a middle ear infection). I should not charge differently. A20If I suspect that a child may have JDM, what tests should my child have before a diagnosis is made? Before making a final diagnosis of JMD, children should have a complete blood count, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and an examination of blood pressure and weight gain. Children with possible JIA should also be evaluated by a pediatric rheumatologist. Diagnosisrequires the exclusion of several other conditions, including inborn errors of metabolism, infection, connective tissue diseases, neoplasms, psychological stressors,and other rhematological disorders. Once these conditions are ruled out, the physician will determine the presence or absence of arthritis. If JCA or JMFA is suspected, an MRI scan of joints and/or a bone scan may be used to aid in the diagnostic process. Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) and rash are common. However, although many children with JIHV have typical symptoms, some children have atypical onset patterns, in which JDA (i.e., decreased hearing abilities) predominates. Therefore, JNM diagnoses should be made only after the appropriate investigations have ruledout other possible reasons for the child'spresumptive hearing loss. Because of possible differences between children'scases, definitive diagnosis can only be established in a tertiary care center with experts in bothjuvenile rhinomanifestations and audiovestibular disorders examining thechild.

Question : Will one antibiotic be as effective as three different antibacterial medicines?\n? The answers to this query are not well established, and there are different possible viewpoints. Here, based on existing research and plausible assumptions, we offer our thoughts on this. In sum, one (and probably a single maximal) daily dose of antibioxtic(s) should be sufficient, although a few exceptions could be considered. The key issue is the severity of infection or degree of resistance to a given drug. If, despite everything, the physician considers it necessary to combine two or more antibials, they should choose the ones that will give the best synergistic effect (while trying to avoid the creation of resistant bacteria in the process) and administer them for as short a time as needed. This is in stark contrast to the usual thinking in which different drugs are routinely and unnecessarily continued until the signs of bacterial infection disappear.

Will they go away even after one course of antibiotic? Question: So do I understand correctly that the only treatment against the borrelia in the ear is to let it dissolve in time, and that antibiosis will delay the process but not stop it? Is that how it works? When erythema manifests itself it is too late to try to influence the course and progress of the disease? The infection needs a lot of time to dissolbe. This is also the reason newborns and children are not much affected, as the bacteria need time enough to mature and multiply. In newborus and young children therefore it takes longer time for the rash to develop and consequently the infection is discovered earlier and treated before it has progressed very far. Also if the 2nd generation antibodies are present in mothers milk the transmission of borreliosis is blockcd, which probably is one of reasons why the children of infected mothers are seldom affected. Regarding antibacterial treatment, what is the opinion of experts about use of antioxidants in chronic diseases, so called \u201chealing bullets\u201d?

Lyme bacterium typically migrates through the body and sets up an inflammatory response that can be disseminated or localized. Although many people notice a bull\u2019 s eye rashe in the first few days, this is not necessary for a diagnosis. If a person presents within the 1st 5 days of symptoms we will not know if the patient has migrated the bacteria to another area. At the longest end of antibiotic window for therapeutic benefit, bacteremia will be cleared from the blood but the migration to other areas has occurred. In these instances we would not be successful in preventing lympedema from developing.

Can it be because the person is too stressed? What causes it? I have seen people in their 40s and 50 years old having a stroke. Is this because they have had high blood pressure or diabetes for a long time? Could it also be due to being too stressful? How does this happen? Why do people at this age still have heart attacks or strokes? Even if they had the diseases, I thought the heart would be strong at that age. I am asking because my father had a brain stroke at the age of 9 years and I want to know why. (Female, 05, Interview  ) ### answer: I think it is because people are too busy and stressed out these days. They do not have time to take care of themselves. Also, they eat unhealthy food and do un healthy things for their body. So, when something happens, it happens. Even for young people, if you eat a lot of meats and fats, your heart will become weak. And if your parents or relatives have high cholesterol or blood pressures, you are more likely to face the problem. That is why I always tell people to go to the hospital and get the check up. It is better to be safe than sorry. We only have one life. Why take a risk of losing it by doing un health things? (Male , ###answer: It could be that the patient has a family history of CAD.

Question: whats the difference between oxytetracycline and doxycycline?\n? Answer is based on difference in molecular structure and biochemistry . The difference can simply be defined on why in doxicyclin molecular changes have been made.

Also why doeoxicycyclin\u2019spowerful effect on poxonforma (a gram negative bacteria known to produce very resistant and protective biofilm matrices around itself when invaded). This is one of the reasons why doctors are directed towards the use of doxiclycylin in poultry animals in particular. Doxycyclinese and its structural analogs have no significant bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacilli. Tetrcyclines, on th other hand, retain a residual level of activity, in spite of this, however their use in human and animal therapy is strongly discouraged due to high potential to induce resistance .

{"Question": "Would you recommend something a bit stronger than meloxicam?", "Free_form_answer": "There are generally three main types of drugs used for pain management: acetaminophen (paracetamol), NSAIDs (like Meloxicam), and opioids. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the least potent but has the safest side effect profile. NSAIDs are generally more potent but carry a risk of harming the kidneys and other side effects. Opioids such as Tramadol (Conzip) and Oxycodone (Oxyado, Oxycontin) are the most potent but carry a significant risk of addiction, toxicity, and cognitive and respiratory adverse effects. In case of acute and severe pain, NSAIDs like Meloxicam are often recommended.

Muscle spasms usually last for less than a few seconds to a couple of minutes. If you are still in pain or have a hard knot in your muscle after a day or two, you may have developed a longer-term muscle strain or tear.2. For muscle strains, the pain usually subsides after 48 hours to 72 hours. However, if the strain is more severe, it can take up to several weeks for the muscle to feel normal again.3. It is important to rest the injured muscle and to apply the RICE treatment (rest, ice, compression, elevation).4. Over-the-counter pain medicines can also help.5. See a doctor if your pain is severe or does not go way after several days.

Question : 1,Is valproate sodium the same as valporate?\n? -No. They contain the similar component valpropate but in different salt forms. The valprene (valpropated) sodum [valproaate sodiium) is acidic (in the formula is a positive charge, Na+) while valproc acid (a negative charge) and acetate (also negative) are present in the valprate.

They told me they were going to be sick, so I asked if they needed a trash can or plastic bag and they said no, that they could hold it. I could tell they didn' t feel well but they maintained that everything was okay when I talked to them. They seemed like a pretty strong person. But then when they walked away, I saw they had a bag with them and it was clear that it had something in it that did not smell good. It was like they held it in until they got away from me.

Question: 84,Can mumps be serious in adults? \n ### Answer: Mumps is a serious disease for adults. It can cause encephalitis, meningitis and deafness. The risk of these complications is highest in young adults 16\u201323 years old and older adults >50 years , but younger, 9\u201315 years, adults are at risk for enchalitits and/or menengitis . The risks of encheahlitis may outweigh the risks for vaccine associated fever and rash, which are typically mild and resolve in a few days. This conclusion was reached based on evidence synthesis from a systematic literature review of 24 high-quality studies involving children from 6 months to 59 years of age, all of which reported on mump infection without vaccination and the two most recent vaccine studies used in the decision to eliminate the requirement for pre-vaccination serologic testing in children at the time of initiation of vaccines for the MMR and MBP vaccinations . Question ### answer: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify IgG avidity testing to identify children who would be at higher risk to develop complicator disease prior to being infected with mucoidyphilis. A test using 485 paired serum samples showed good correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.9) to a quantitative antibody binding assay. In a subsequent analysis using an algorithm that would identify a child with low antibodies IU/ml, followed by an aviditiy test to verify waning antibbodics, then a determination whether the child had at least one risk factor (\u22646 years or sickle or Hb E disease), the study identified children most at-risk for having complication disease following a mullerian infection, and highlighted the importance of antibiotic in reducing the risk in these children . In this analysis, we used the algorithm to show the probability of being at a higher- or lower- risk based solely on age and vaccinal history, i.e., if", "Question: 83,How many times can you get whooping cough? \n ### Answer: The same person can get Whooping Cough more than once.

Answer : If it\u2019s a relatively large amount of debris, yes. If not, no, that would not constitute a major problem. The problem would be if there was a lot of material in there, which would create a problem of light scattering and could potentially increase the risk of infection.

Question2: the cause of mucositis? , 3.The cause is likely to be multifactorial, including both chemical (the drugs) and mechanical (friction and heat from rubella against the masticated food).4.Cyclophosphamide, a potent alkylating agent, causes severe murotoxicity, resulting in rapid death of smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. This mechanism explains the development in rubellar vomiting (6).RAS: The mechanism by which rubrella virus enters the body is still unknown. The most accepted theory is that it passes through the mouth or nose, although it has also been found in semen (7). It would then reach the blood and connective tissue, to the endothelium of blood vessel walls and subsequently into the lymphatic system. Following this, the virus invades the smooth muscle tissue in small blood-filled vessels, such as capillaries. It is possible that other tissues, cells or body fluids could also be infected by rubellan virus particles (8). Some studies have demonstrated the presence of viral antigen in nerve cells; however, whether this is an indication of direct infection or simply the result of metabolic dysfunction is unknown (9).Other mechanisms include the multiplication of virus in fibroblasts and its dissemination into adjacent tisuues (10).Further theory of transmission includes entrance of raw sewage and rubbish into food preparations and their transmission via this route (i).It has been detected that rublla virus replicates itself efficiently in vitro at", "would that be a sign of infection? and can something like that turn into a conjunctivitis?

Middle ear effusions are often serous, but may be purulent in severe cases and in children with chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), who may also have retracted tympanic membranes. Management should be aimed at preventing spread of infection to other parts of body or other children if in a nursing home or day care center setting, and recovering hearing function if hearing impairment is present. Treatment may vary from antibiotics and corticosteroid ear drops to simple treatment of any underlying medical problem and monitoring of progression. Early treatment is important because the longer a child has secretions in the ear, the greater the chance of getting a chest infection from the bacteria.

Symptomatic: This includes the use of analgesics and antipyretics to alleviate pain and fever. 2. Specific to the pathogen: Antibiotics are used to treat middle ears infections (this will discussed in more detail in the following section). 3. Supportive care: Includes making sure that the child has sufficient fluid in their ears, by positioning them so that they are not sitting or lying. Fluid in middle earnames a better channel for transmission of sound waves, which means that sound intensity level for the hearing should be less to achieve the same intensity of stimulus (a measure called SIR). Question: does steroid eye drops cause eye inection?\n? Question Answer 0,How can i get rid of eye floaters? A: Several studies have suggested that eye surgery (vitrectomy) can effectively remove large or bothersome floatings.

BVD is caused by an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria that are normally present in the vagina. These bacteria replace the Lactobacillus bacteria, which are usually the most abundant in a healthy vaginal flora. The misconception that BVP is an STI may arise because it is more common in sexally active young women.

It mostly affects females and it is caused by an imbalance in the vaginal ecosystem, which leads to the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria. Question: If a female has bacterical vaginitis, what does that mean for her male partner? Will he get it too?\n?3,Is your answer to that yes or no? If yes, please describe exactly how and explain briefly exactly what action the male partners should do to avoid getting the infection. If no, then explain why not? Question Answer 2,This section on treatment is incomplete and some links are broken. Please update and check the links. While the recommendations for women are sound, recommendations on male treatment are not provided. Furthermore, a description of the problem in males is needed.I would like to see a section devoted to non-antibiotic treatments, an extremely important category, especially for male patients, but also for females.The discussion is way too short and superficial; please expand it and discuss all relevant aspects, e.g., long-term consequences of treatment, also with respect to resistance issues, side effects, particularly also social aspects (stigma, abortion, relationship, etc.) Question:-What causes a person to have BDD?-### Answer : What causes BBD?The person may have an overactive imagination or a fear of losing control. What is your opinion?BBD is usually caused when the brain, the nervous system that controls our bodies and minds, tries to make sense of chemicals that it receives from the stomach. The stomach makes these chemicals from food and liquids that we have eaten or drunk. During the digestion process, food particles activate acid producing neurons of vagal afferent fibres. Dying neuromuscular cells in tissues of glands, salivary gland, bowel, and skin transmit signals that are interpreted by the nerves that control a persons mood.These signals are transduced into chemicals by neuronal affinity for acetylcholine (ACh) or epinephrine (Epi). Deficiency of ACh allows abnormal gut activity, causing disorders such as irritable bowels, cramping, nausea, heaving, diarrhoea and vomiting, while high levels of Epi slow down digestive processes, leading", "### Answer: 2,Vaginitis, especially when caused by T. vaginalis and other pathogens, is a nuisance and can be uncomfortable, but is usually not considered to be a serious condition. There is, however, increasing evidence that T vaginit is associated with an increased risk of acquiring HIV and becoming infected with other STIs [86\u2022\u2022].3,There is little direct evidence about the psychological impact of bacterial vaginos (except for discomfort and pain), but anecdotal reports suggesting that BV is psychologically as well as physically debilitating, affecting self-esteem, sexual relationships, etc., have led to calls for greater recognition of this condition and its implications [60\u2022, 76,80,127,243]. Question: how serious is bacteremia\n? : How serious can an infection become when it enters the blood stream? It can become very serious and may lead to shock, septic shock or other complications that can result in organ failure and even death.

When the hair follicles of the skin get closed due to the excess oil, it forms a lesion called comedones. The bacteria P. acnes, which is found on the face, chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs, etc., enters the closed comedone and causes infection. This infection causes the immune system to send white blood cells to fight off the bacteria. As a result, the area around the infected pore becomes red and swollen. If the comedonal pus is not released through the pustule, then the infection can spread and cause more redness, swelling, pain, scarring, or even a fever. Question 3 :what causes a blood clot?    \n #### Answer Blood clogs are caused when blood coagulates. Coagulation is when liquid blood turns into a semi-solid called plasma.

Question 2,How long antibiotic after scaling and root planing? In general, patients with chronic periodontitis should be prescribed 3\u20136 months of antibiotics in combination with SRP, whereas patients who are at high risk of developing periodontoitis (e.g. those with a medical history of period onto- and peri-implantitis, young patients, smokers, etc.) should receive 6 month antibioitcs. The duration of systemic antibacterial therapy should begin once SRPs have been carried out until the inflamed tooth-supporting structures and associated conditions have stabilised. However, even in cases of full-mouth SRPS in patients highly susceptible to developing infectious complications, 1-3 months after all the quadrants are treated are to be preferred. This is because, during the first month post-SRP the individual risk for infections is higher due to the significant pathogen load caused by the scaling of the biofilm from the necrot", "Question: what are 3 causes of a head injury? \n ### Answer: Acceleration and decelerations of the head, Direct impact to the skull, and Rotational forces acting on the brain can all cause a Head Injury Cognitive impairment, Physical injury of head and/or spinal cord, Coma, Convulsions, Bleeding in/out of brain cells, Skull fractures. Head injuries can be caused by falls, blunt objects, explosions and assaults. Causes of Head injury were grouped into three major categories: accidents, assault and health condition. Accidents (52.7%), assault (28.4%) and Health condition (18%) were the three leading causes. Among accidents causing head injuries, falls (38) and sporting events (8:6) were most common, followed by drownings, burns, electrocutions. In India, Accidental (75%) was found to be the most cause of injury to brain, compared to assaultive (6%) cause . Violence (assault) was the leading cause for traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) (95, 4.6). The types of assault ranged from being hit, kicked, or stabbed, to being shot or having a knife or sharp object used on them. Violent attacks can also result in the victim sustaining a TBI from a fall, following being pushed, pulled or thrown. Further a deliberate act intended to injure or kill an individual was classified as an Assault. The brain injury was a result of violent contact to a stationary or moving object, a blow or an impact with a surface or object. However, when the force of impact was minimal or without the intention to cause harm, it was not classified . Health conditions included disease, disorder and other medical conditions such as tumor, septicemia.

The paper is almost ready for publication, but the authors need to explain the rationale behind the use of a probotic product in children with diarreha associated with viral infection. Thank you. 3,I have added a paragraph in which I explain that the diaper rash is not caused by the virus that causes the common cold but by a different virus. This clarification should help the reader to understand that using the probioitcs is justified. Please see lines 192-185.4.I also added the information that in a previous study we found that probios could be used to prevent diper rashes caused either by viruses or by bacteria. See lines206-211.5 I also changed the title to include the word \u201cprevention\u201d and to specify that diapers rushes caused of by either virsuses of bacteria can be prevented.6 I changed also the abstract to reflect these changes.7 I added also a discussion of how probitics can help to restore the balance of intestial flora.8 I explained", "No, but it may detect consequences of kidneys stones like the one I discussed in the previous case.

Question: how long after surgery can u get compartment syndrome?\n?3,I'm aware of compartments in the body constricting blood vessels, nerve and lymphatics but is there any evidence that such a process could occur within a relatively short period of time (minutes) as is the case in acute CS? Or is this pressure being generated over a longer period thereby producing a more gradual onset of the clinical picture? If the latter, does the initial event (such as trauma, deposition of irritating substances, etc.) set off a cascade of biological events that lead to this condition? Please, could you enlighten us? Tight or constriictive clothing, particularly footwear, has often been blamed for this disorder but it would be interesting to know if there are instances where the syndrome developed in loose or even baggy clothing (maybe with hidden bulges).
