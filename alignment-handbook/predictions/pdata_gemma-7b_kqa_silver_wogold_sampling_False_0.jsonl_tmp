This type of cough is typically a good sign as it means your body is trying to clear the lungs of mucus, but it can also cause discomfort and disrupt sleep. Instead of a suppressant, you would typically use an expectorant to help loosen mucus, making it easier to expel from your lungs.

This usually happens when outdoor molds release their spores, and trees, grasses, weeds release tiny pollen particles into the air. When you have a seasonal allergy and you breathe in these allergens, your body mistakes these harmless particles as a threat and releases antibodies to attack them. These antibodies trigger a release of a chemical called histamine which causes nasal congestion, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose. Common triggers of seasonal allergies include tree pollen, grass pollen, weed pollen, and spores from fungi and molds. Treatment options can include avoiding the allergen, over-the-counter or prescription allergy medication, and allergy shots for more severe cases.", "Must_have": ["Seasonal allergies occur during specific times of the year when plants release pollen and spores.", "Symptoms can include nasal congestion, sneezing, watery eyes, and a runny nose.", "Treatment options can include avoiding the allergen, medication, and allergy shots."], "Nice_to_have": ["Seasonal allergies are also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis.", "When an individual with a seasonal allergy breathes in an allergen, their body mistakes it for a threat and attacks it, causing symptoms.", "Tree pollen, grass pollen, weed pollen, and spores from fungi and molds are common triggers of seasonal allergies."], "ICD_10_diag": "Urticaria, unspecified", "sample_predictions": ["1.

One way is to take antihistamines. Antihistamines are a type of medication that can help reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They work by blocking the action of histamine, which is a chemical that is released by the body in response to an allergen.\n\nAntihistamines can be taken as a pill, liquid, or nasal spray.

Some common antihistamines include cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), and fexofenadine (Allegra).\n\nAntihistamines can help reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and congestion. They can also help reduce the severity of an allergic reaction, such as hives or swelling.\n\nIt is important to note that antihistamines are not a cure for allergies. They can help reduce the symptoms, but they will not prevent an allergic reaction from occurring. If you have severe allergies, you may need to take other medications, such as corticosteroids or immunotherapy.\n\nIf you are considering taking antihistamines for your allergies, it is important to talk to your doctor first.

A healthy tongue is typically pink and covered with small nodules known as papillae. However, changes in the appearance of your tongue might indicate a vitamin deficiency.

Iron deficiency can also lead to an inflamed, sore or strangely smooth tongue. A deficiency in these vitamins could also result in a condition known as angular cheilitis, characterized by sores or cracks at the corners of the mouth.

{"Question": "Is there another medicine that you would recommend instead of Sudafed, since it has acetaminophen in it?", "Free_form_answer": "Yes, Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) is a medication that is primarily used for nasal congestion. If you're looking to avoid medications containing acetaminophen, there are several alternatives available. For instance, you may consider phenylephrine-based products like Sudafed PE. Although this is not the same active ingredient as Sudafed, it is also used to treat nasal congestion without containing any acetaminophen. Another medication option could be oxymetazoline, which is found in some nasal sprays like Afrin. Finally, for allergy-related congestion, antihistamines such as Claritin (loratadine) or Zyrtec (cetirizine) may also be considered.
