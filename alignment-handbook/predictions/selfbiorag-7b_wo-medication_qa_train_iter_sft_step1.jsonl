On the one hand, there are many similarities with other autoimmune disorders, and on the other hand, there are also striking differences.The diagnosis of PMR often relies heavily on excluding other autoimmune disorders.However, it is becoming increasingly clear that PMR is also a separate entity with distinct features, and it is no longer appropriate to consider it a variant of another autoimmune disorder.Therefore,PMR is considered an autoimmune disorder."}
{"text": "Question: 20,Is pneumonia very serious? \n ### Answer: Yes, pneumonia can be a serious condition, especially for older adults and those with underlying health conditions. Pneumonia can lead to complications such as pneumothorax (collapsed lung), pleural effusion (build-up of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall), or infection spread to other parts of the body. It can also result in organ failure and even death if left untreated.\nHowever, many cases of pneumonia are mild and can be treated at home with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers.It is important to seek medical attention if you experience severe symptoms, have underlying health conditions, or are in a high-risk group."}

{"text": "Question: But can blocked sinuses cause vertigo? \n ### Answer: Yes, blocked sinuses can cause vertigo. Heres why: the sinuses are connected to the ear through small passages called ostia.When the sinuses are blocked, it can lead to increased pressure in the sinus passages, which can then push against the delicate structures of the middle ear.This pressure shift can lead to a sensation of spinning or vertigo.\nAdditionally, if there is any inflammation or infection present in the sinuses, it can further aggravate the symptoms of vertigo.It is important to note that while blocked sinuses can contribute to vertigo, other conditions or factors may also play a role.If you experience persistent or severe vertigo, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."}
{"text": "Question: So longer on antibiotics helps deeper infection? \n ### Answer: This is because the bacteria causing the infection are not completely killed and so continue to harbor antibiotic-resistant genes. Since these resistant bacteria can then establish infection if the antibiotic is removed, the prolonged use of antibiotics increases the risk of metastatic infection.In the case of MRSA, recall that it is a member of the normal human flora; therefore, it too can harbor antibiotic resistance genes.In summary, the deeper the infection penetration, the greater is the chance that bacteria resistant to the administered antibiotic will be present and, as a result, the more prolonged the use of antibiotics needed to eradicate the infection."}

{"text": "Question: Is this contagious? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes, all the way back to the infection of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. (Some branches of Christianity, notably Catholicism, believe that humankind inherited a predisposition to sinfulness through the fall of Adam and Eve.)In terms of mainstream biology, original sin is not a plausible hypothesis.Nor, if we were to observe it, could we say that it is a scientifically valid theory.Unlike the inheritance of physical traits, we do not observe people \"inheriting\" behavioral traitudes through direct transmission from parents.Even if such a mechanism were demonstrated, behavioral genetic studies suggest that most complex behaviors--including both good and evil--are the results of the interaction of multiple genes with the environment.This means that no single gene (including a sin gene) would be directly responsible for an individual's sinful ways.Individual sins would have to be attributed to specific circumstances, which would make them extrinsic to the genes and therefore difficult to ascribe to a single inherited tendency.Moreover, even if original sin existed, its biological plausibility is questionable.After all, there is no clear pathway by which such a mechanism could influence the two separated spheres of the spiritual and the physical.In conclusion, we can say that original sin is a matter for theology, not biology."}
