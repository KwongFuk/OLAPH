{"text": "Question: Alright so I dont know much about Lexapro would you tell me more about it? \n ### Answer: Does it cause any side-effects and is it safe to use for someone too young? Thanks for letting me on here. -Elva\n\nLexapro is an antidepressant in the same class as Celexa, Prozac, Paxil etc. Forget about how old you are, but deal with the diagnosis per say. For some reason Lexapro is seen as the one that has the least sided effects \u2014 I dont know why because It works the same way as the rest of the drugs in this class which are problematic and true they do at least have few side-effects such as insomnia, nausea, headache, appetite change, anxiety and those sorts of things. What you don't see are the nasty side-effects that can occur.\n\nSo its hard to say to somone your age what drug to take, but I'd recommend to steer away from Lexapro if you can then instead of handling worsening symptoms of anxiety and depression with a medication but instead just hanging out with friends and trying to be with people that you feel comfortable with plus voluntary work and other activities to cure the dullness caused by the antidepressant medication. Its not that hard to cure but some have such extreme cases that they need medication."}

We strongly recommend that patients with these conditions work under the supervision of a health care provider.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDr. Tammy Wong replies:\n\n- Cold sores occur from the herpes-virus; unfortunately, there is no known cure, but there are antiviral medicines that work very well when taken in the early stages of the virus reactivation. However, with your sensitivity to medicines, you would certainly need to have a careful discussion with your physician to come up with the safest treatment possible.\n- Mouth ulcers/canker sores, as you know, are wholly different (for dental guidance, please view our previous post, \u201cWhat Do We Do About Canker Sores?\u201d). These typically occur when there is a slight injury that causes trauma to the inner lining of your mouth. Generally, they\u2019ll heal within a few days, but nutrition can certainly play a role in how quickly it heals, and prevention may just be the best medicine. Be sure to get enough B-vitamins (rather than just one) and also do your best to avoid injury (this can be difficult in the Sjogren\u2019s patient\u2026let go of the toothbrush, refrain from biting on them, and try to remember the one that popped up this morning \u2013 don\u2019t bite it). I also review the herbal factor for it too. In this patient population a topical application of food grade sodium bicarbonate (Sea/Sally, Polident or Pensyl) can be used as a mouth rinse that I\u2019ve seen take a whopper of an ulcer down to seemingly nothing in a very short time. Sodium bicarbonate works by lowering the pH to a basic (more alkaline) which this virus strain will not tolerate. It effectively \u2018short circuits\u2019 it. Though it makes a lot of sense, and is not toxic with topical applications like this, it might not be tolerated by all.

{"text": "Question: And what could be causing the white tongue? \n ### Answer: White tongue can be caused by tobacco use, allergic reactions, bacteria and dehydration \u2014 and it\u2019s often a symptom of something else.

This may contribute to foggy head, general aches and pains, grumpiness, angry moods, brain fog, fatigue, headache, and jaw pain as well as approach, migraine and different types of headaches.\n\nNerve pressure in the cervical spine (neck) can cause distention of the veins in the neck as is the case with sinus infections.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body\u2019s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults and requires daily insulin injections to control blood sugar levels.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in adults and can be managed with a combination of diet, exercise, and medication.\n\nDiabetes can be a serious and life-threatening disease, but it can be managed with proper treatment.

A study done at the University of Toronto shows cognitive issues can result in a chronic depression.\n\n### Different Forms Of Depression\n\nIn ordinary life, there are different forms of depression and we will see a doctor if we suffer from these signs: sadness lasting more than 2 weeks, sleep changes, irritation, anxiety, appetite changes, losing interest in daily activities, loss of hope, insecurity, panic attacks, negative thoughts, experiancedown and in again mood swings and etc\u2026\n\nDepression may cause memory problemsfound in both aging and young people.

Prolactin elevates brain chemical dopamine in the major midbrain is thought to trigger memory loss. Drug addiction also may cause the lack of memory.\n\nLocal brain lesion or injury on the cortex stimulation may decrease memory deficits. It is a main cause of memory loss during an emotional illness.Unlike the memory loss for normal people, depression may extract unwanted or desired information from the brain. War veterans who suffered from depression are found to have more memory loss than general population.\n\nMajor depressive disorder may cause spatial memory problems (found in the sense of direction and grasping location of objects, places and people), and performance deficits in memory tests. Depression symptom is likely to be increased during active treatment for several weeks or months. Emotional illnesses (burnout) that last for more than 3 months may impair attention, psychomotor, memory, mental arithmetic, encoding and retrieval of new word list. Major depression decreases about 20 percent of memory deficit in healthy people and about 25-40 percent of short memory-spatial short-term memory, mood and attention problem. On the other hand, decreasing working memory and cognitive impairment is a major component of the depressed mood.

Hopefully once you know there won't be any uncertainty.\n\nBRIEF EXPLANATIONS FOR CANKER SORES VS. COLD SORE VS. HERPES\n\nA canker sore is something completely different from a cold sore or a cold.\n\nAlthough a canker sore looks unsightly it is not herpes.\n\nHerpes can cause cold sores and cold sores will sometimes be mistaken for canker sores because they both bleed and tingle in the same places.\n\nHerpes is a virus. Canker Sores have no virus in them yet they can be connected to the immune system as well as stress.\n\nTRADITIONAL CONCEPTS OF CANKER SORE AND VS. COLD SORE AND VS. HERPES\n\nFirst, when it comes to the difference between canker sores and cold sores, both are quite different.\n\nCanker sores are outside of the mouth, whereas cold sores are on top of the mouth. Thus, a cold sore is also known as a \"fever blister.\"\n\nThe common cold blisters are caused by the herpes virus, which can be spread from touching the blisters then your eyes area. Most herpes viruses are contagious.\n\nHerpes is recurring, meaning that fever blisters return twice a year, but the frequency and severity can differ from person to person.\n\nOn the other hand, generally, canker sores are not contagious, although they are prone to spreading, but they only last a short period of time, sometimes 1-2 weeks and can be widely noticed. Canker sores result from an infection within the mouth, or as a result of an injury.\n\nSYMPTOMS AND RELATED CONTENTS FOR CANKER SORE VS. COLD SORE VS.

{"text": "Question: How do I measure blood pressure? \n ### Answer: When it comes to measuring blood pressure, having the appropriate equipment and knowing how to use it is essential. However, it is also crucial to understand what causes your blood pressure to vary and to know what actions to take and what symptoms to look for to protect your heart.\n\nA device known as a sphygmomanometer, which consists of two parts \u2014 a blood pressure cuff and a strain gauge connected to a pressurized air column on the instrument itself (sphygmomanometer). Knowing how to use these two instruments is essential for taking a blood pressure reading.\n\nBP Monitor or any other digital devices are more convenient as they can keep track of your blood pressure and date readings with a few fingertips right at your own home or wherever you are.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts:\n\nDo\u2019s:\n\n- Find a spot that is well-lit and not too chilly.\n- Your arm should be at heart elevation.\n- Your arm should be relaxed and up to your torso.\n- Your arm should be near to you but relaxed.\n- Allow for an adequate amount of time.\n- Allow yourself to be as comfy as you possibly can.\n- Don\u2019t Talk while the test is being done.\n\nDon\u2019ts:\n\n- Don\u2019t empty your cotton tank.\n- Cigarettes, caffeine, and other drugs like chocolate should be avoided.\n- Do not eat a heavy meal within the last 30 minutes.\n- Don\u2019t exercise or engage in any strenuous work within the last 30 minutes.\n\nPrecautions:\n\nWhen taking basic vital signs like temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure, it is crucial to keep in mind that place of measurement affects the reading for temperature, length, and pulse. It is fair to say that these variables also influence blood pressure readings. Blood pressure readings, just like those for height, length, and pulse, undergo a variety of factors apart from the environment in which they are being measured.\n\nWe now have 4 readings, or triplicate readings (3 times simultaneously) in the lab (72 hours apart), to try to get an \u201caverage\u201d of the measured value; we must provide an estimate of the detection Limit on the standard error of the mean for those 4 readings to get an \u201c"}

{"text": "Question: How is HRV different from heart rate? \n ### Answer: Both are measures of your cardiovascular activity during rest or activity. Below illustrates comparison of these two heart rate variables. Understanding the distinction between the two can help you feel better, train better, and improve healing of the body. After all, health is all encompassing!\n\nDifferences:\n\n- Resting heart rate can adjust in the short term, but this adjustment is enacted at the cardiovascular level, specifically the sympathetic nervous system. It beats faster to compensate for the body activity.\n- HRV is more of your cardiovascular master clock. The heart uses the electrical conduction network within the heart to contract. This network varies in its reports from cell to cell across the heart. These reports can correct irregular times for conduction to a normal pattern within a heart beat. If this master clock is deficient with poor variability, more variables or timing differences are present to conduct this beat. It is an ANS problem not a cardiovascular problem.\n\nHRV provides insight into your internal clock. Can your body find the right rhythm? Do you understand and can you master the stress triggers in your life? Trust your body and give it the most optimal energy it needs to function at it\u2019s best."}
{"text": "Question: How is PID treated? \n ### Answer: The treatment modalities for PID will differ depending on the type of infection, but the basic management of all of them requires a visit to your physician and medical treatment. For example, treatment will follow a different path for mycoplasma, chlamydia, and gonococcus infections. Mycoplasma infection requires macrolide antibiotic therapy; chlamydia is eradicated with azithromycin or doxycycline; and gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics. These antibiotics can be given orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of the patient's condition. If your doctor suspects the presence of an STD that causes PID, he or she will usually send a sample to the lab for testing and confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the case of acute PID, antibiotic therapy is the first line of treatment. Other treatments that may be considered include surgery to drain a pyosalpinx or an abscess, bilateral salpingectomy, removal of ectopic pregnancy, Caesarean section, and IV therapy (IV antibiotic treatment is very important to control potentially lethal toxic shocklike syndrome). When patients receive one of these treatments, antibiotic resistance is less likely to occur.\n\nSurgery is also needed when conservative treatment with antibiotics has failed, endometriosis develops, or there is residual problems or pelvic abscess. Surgeon must perform more aggressive surgery when PID has already caused adhesions and if a treatment that produces well-defined structures is required like tubectomy [20].\n\nThere are reports about the replacement of existing implants on patients exposed to PID in the past and concerns associated with pelvic implants [21].\n\nHow to prevent PID?\n\nAccording to the ACOG, PID can be reduced by performing tests for STDs when a woman has genital infections. A test for chlamydia and another for gonorrhea should be considered for all sexually active women annually or when at risk and for any woman attending a family planning clinic for the first time [22].\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease therapy is not easy only because the diagnosis is difficult; proper treatment depends upon a careful medical and surgical history and a thorough understanding of the pathological mechanisms including"}

The answers to these and a lot more questions you may have are coming.\n\nBupropion is an anti-depressant that is prescribed as an unlabeled off-label medication for individuals suffering from often mild to moderate ADHD. Wellbutrin is the most commonly prescribed name-brand for bupropion along with Aplenzin and Zyban. It is a prescribed anti-depressant more commonly prescribed to those suffering from ADHD than any other off label medication Bupropion XL-230 (Wellbutrin XL) or wide open (Wellbutrin nursing can also be utilized to desensitize smokers).\n\nAn overview of bupropion helps you understand the huge spectrum of medication makers offering medication such as Bupris, Zyban, Qudexy, and Wellbutrin and how Wellbutrain generic works and its use.\n\nWhy Is Bupropion an Anti-Depressant for ADHD?\n\nBupropion blocks the re-uptake of Dopamine, a \u201cpleasure chemical\u201d implicated in the cycle of addictive substance abuse. However, it also blocks the \u201cmoved stript\u201d from taking back up Dopamine. This stops the relapse associated with addictive triggers such as cigarettes, alcohol or cocaine.\n\nThe withdrawals that take place when one is trying to give up cigarettes, alcohol, or other addictive substances also relate to using Bupropion to overcome the issues facing others. Faced with shakes, insomnia, and depression, one could tell a lot about the course of a treat.\n\nThe most significant effect of Bupropion used to treat ADHD patients is that it does not significantly interfere with neurographic jitter nerves used to determine the mental activities for ADHD treatment. In addition, good results are predicted for individuals using bupropion to desensitize smokers from continued use of nicotine."}

What vaccination should I take? \n ### Answer: The Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) and World Health organization (WHO), recommends that travelers to Brazil receive the yellow fever vaccine. After a yellow fever epidemic in Brazil, the vaccine may not be readily available. For this reason, you should purchase and carry along with you a Certificate of Vaccination (yellow card), as proof that you have received your yellow fever vaccine. Without proof of yellow fever vaccination, the Brazilian authorities may detain and quarantine you for up to six days. You can also be turned away from Brazil and sent back to your country of origin. Make sure you receive your yellow fever vaccination at least 10 days before your trip."}

As far as timing is concerned, it is recommended that probiotics can be taken 1-2 hours apart or 1-2 hours before/after the antibiotic, whichever is preferable to you. These 2-hour spans are based on gastric emptying half-life and will allow acidic gastric juices to fully inactivate the antibiotic before probiotic travel through the digestive system, and then inactivation will take place by probiotics*"}

In fact the withdrawal can have the effect of causing the condition to be worse than it was before. Treatment with medication should always be medically supervised and carefully monitored, especially if it involves stopping a particular medicine. Some medical conditions require you to take the medication for the rest of your life.\nThere are different kinds of anti-depressants and they vary in the way they work and the side effects they produce. They will have different withdrawal characteristics. Prozac (or the generic name fluovrsamine) inhibits the re-absorbtion of serotonin in the brain, which in turn can reduce the uke of excess of serotonin which can cause depression. Withdrawal of Prozac should be gradual, which will prevent a number of negative effects like dizziness, headache, vomiting, and insomnia. Do not stop it abruptly. Tell your doctor what bothers you the most from Prozac not work.\nProzac usually stays in your system for about five weeks after your last dose. However, this depends on several b,ong conditions and the rate at which you metabolize this drug. Whenever possible, use a safe and efective medication instead of antidepressants.\n\nLetter #: 415857\nCategory: Drug and Alcohol Abuse"}

{"text": "Question: Is blepharitis contagious? \n ### Answer: Some people who have blepharitis believe it is contagious, but in most cases it\u2019s not. But it still carries some dangers.\n\nBlepharitis is, to some degree, unavoidable and represents one of the most common reasons for eyelid inflammation in both children and adults. It\u2019s an ongoing condition, and one that requires you take steps to keep any symptoms in check.\n\n## What Is Blepharitis?\n\nBlepharitis is a type of eye inflammation that involves inflammation of your eyelids. It can affect your upper eyelid or your lower eyelid \u2014 or both.\n\nPain from blepharitis can range from minimally to severely irritating.\n\nAccording to Harvard Health, there are several causes of blepharitis, but the most common one is microscopic \u2014 or eyelash \u2014 mites.\n\nMites are small, cyst-like organisms that extend their reddish-brown legs beyond their shell-like bodies. They remain hidden in your eyelashes and carry a bacteria called Staphylococcus epidermis, which contributes to the irritation of the lids. These mites, which are about the size of a grain of salt, likely result from bacteria that produces the mite shell.\n\nAlso known as mite demodex, blepharitis may be caused by a mild bacterial infection. There are two main types: anterior and posterior.\n\nAnterior blepharitis is related to the oil glands (meibomian gland) at the base of your eyelashes, right on top of your eyelids. Posterior blepharitis is related to the oil glands in the middle of your eyelid. It\u2019s slightly more common in people with rosacea. That inflammatory skin condition is known to redden the skin on the face and cause inflammation \u2014 and sometimes acne-like red bumps or sores \u2014 to appear just under the lid closest to your nose.\n\n## Blepharitis Contagious?

{"text": "Question: Is it common to have an abscess with no pain? \n ### Answer: While each individual is different, and each pain experience will have its own dynamics and timeline, it is not common to have an abscess with no pain. Usually, pain will start immediately or within a few days, and it will intensify over time as the infection spreads and the pressure increases.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the pain might develop later and intensify gradually over time, even with a lack of awareness. This is particularly true if the pain is localized to the skin, since pain under the skin is often a sign of systemic illness (e.g., infection, injury) that can easily be masked by other sensations.\n\nPain in this case can be an unmistakeable sign of a problem.\n\n## What are the 4 signs of an infection?\n\nInfectious syndromes arise when infection with pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi) causes a distinct set of symptoms in the host.\n\nThere are four common signs of an infection:\n\n1. Fever: Fever is one of the most common clinical signs of infection. Fever results from an inflammatory response by the body to the presence of a microbe.\n\nThe entire body reacts to foreign pathogens (bacteria) by increasing the body temperature, increasing the metabolism and producing white blood cells.\n\nThis causes a rise in the body temperature, and the result is a fever. A high body temperature is the body\u2019s response to injury, infection, and inflammation.\n\nNormally, temperature stays within a range of between 98.6 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If the body gets infected, an inflammation process will be generated, and the temperature will go higher.\n\nIn general, when the temperature of the body goes above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, there is a threat of an infection. The higher the body temperature goes, the more severe the infection is.\n\n2. Increased white blood cell count: Usually, the white blood cells in the body are found in the bone marrow. After an infection by a foreign pathogen, increased white blood cell counts can occur in spleen, liver, lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and kidney.\n\nWhite blood cell levels can be measured by blood tests to gauge an infection.\n\n3.

{"text": "Question: Is there any kind of medication you can prescribe in the meantime to help reduce my sweating ? \n ### Answer: AskDocWeb: Sweating is a natural response to hyperhidrosis. Did you know that every hour of every day our bodies produce more than a liter of sweat? The body's sweat glands are mostly located under the arms, in the groin and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Even though sweating is typically triggered by exposure to heat, it can also be a natural cooling mechanism. Sweating can be a response to emotions and can first appear at any age. Difficulty with handling anxiety and the sympathetic nervous system playing too much of a role can trigger an individual\u2019s sweating to go into overdrive. Treatment is often a choice between new oral medications with problems or scalpels and needles with extreme risks. Are you ready to leave that all behind?\n\nHow did you get on the sweating medication? Is it prescribed by a dermatologist?\n\nAskDocWeb: Always us a doctor or dermatologist when treating a medical condition. You must first ask your doctor whether he or she has had any amount of training in treating hyperhidrosis. Ask how many patients similar to you he or she has treated. Since hyperhidrosis is not generally taught in the medical schools, you must ask if they read, learned and/or studied about it. Urge for a more thorough and appropriate evaluation. Your best bet is to seek help from a medical doctor who specializes in conditions just like yours and not for a doctor who dabbles in treatments like these only as part of an overall skin treatment practice.\n\nI now have anxiety when I use my hands in public.\n\nAskDocWeb: AMiDARc\u2122 is the simple and safe way to finally regain that control over your hyperhidrosis. With AMiDARc^{\u2122}, you'll live a normal, confident, sweat-free life. This revolutionary treatment stops the over production of the body's stimulants.

Some days are better than others, but there are still days where I just start sweating and my heart starts racing. What should Im be looking out for?\n\nThere are a variety of things that can cause palpitations and or \u2018passing out\u2019 sensations. These include; stress, dehydration, lack of food, side effects to medication etc.\n\nSeeing your GP is the first step in trying to work out what is going on, as a certain type of test or medication may need to be carried out.\n\nHowever, do also mention how you feel to anyone because they might have had a similar experience but it is important that you seek professional advice/help too\n\nHi, As Palpitations are quite common want to check when you are experiencing them? Is it when standing up suddenly from sitting etc. If  these are typical of standing up from sitting, then its possible you have \u2018orthostatic\u2019 hypotension and will require blood pressure cuffs on both arms. Take pulse laying first and then once stood for a few minutes. If your pulse is much higher when stood up your lying pulses are slower than usual \u2013 meaning you have normal resting pulses, though can recover better standing up due to help of gravity, then you have \u2018orthostatic\u2019 hypotension. Both arms blood pressure cuffs then needed.\n\nHi Sweetheart,\n\nThe first thing I would suggest is that you see your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy. Have some blood tests done and tell him your symptoms. You may have blood pressure problems, hypoglycemia, or your body may just need to rest. The palpitations will go away when your heart is healthy again. Some women feel this way after their baby is weaned, since the high levels of estrogen fluctuate.\n\nAnother option is to make an appointment with your ob/gyn in case of pregnancy, to check your thyroid for hypothyroidism.\n\nPerhaps a vitamin-mineral and B-complex could help you. I suggest stopping alcohol, tea, coffee and caffiene, anything that might have a diuretic effect. Supplement with magnesium to calm your nerves.\n\nLet me know if you want more info and suggestions.\n\nViewing 11 posts - 1 through 11 (of 1"}

If what is indicated is rather simple in application, you may learn while trying to incorporate this new idea into your routine, of course it is not worth losing.

{"text": "Question: Is viral pharyngitis an allergy thing? \n ### Answer: Can allergy to certain foods cause pharyngitis? The short answer is yes. However, let\u2019s see how this can happen, and how such a reaction could manifest itself. Fact is, many things can play a role to trigger reactions to allergens that precipitate a viral infection and that would express itself in your throat. In This Article, we shall describe these different cause of allergic Viral Pharyngitis and how you can treat this.\n\n## Is Viral Pharyngitis An Allergy Thing? Pharyngitis Allergy In Technically Terms\n\nWe have many different kinds of viruses that can cause pharyngitis, most of them really common and are almost ubiquitous and can actually cause numerous different conditions. That\u2019s why it may be a little bit confusing sometimes to distinguish one type of pharyngitis from another. We also have a lot of reactions that happen in the body. And in some instances, one virus may cause a number of reactions, and a standard, run of the mill virus will express itself completely differently in one person than it will from another person. That\u2019s also why it can be a little confusing, and you can see lots, lots of different symptoms that people develop.\n\nHowever, there are certain kinds of reactions that you can witness that may suggest the viral pharyngitis is caused or at least triggered or caused by an allergy reaction. But the key fact here is that a virus may play its role precipitating an allergy. Whatever the origin of that virus, it could be either a biological organism in itself, whether that is a wet virus, like the flu, or flus, various other pneumonia, whatever it may be there is also something that can be a trigger for an allergic-type reaction.\n\nAnd one of the immediate reactions that a body can have is actually a gastrointestinal reaction, it\u2019s a digestive reaction. Now, that may not be recognizable as a problem because when you start reacting to something and then it works its way down to the digestive system.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever taken any kind of medication, just basically any kind of medicine or supplement to start off with, after a couple of days of consumption, many times your gastrointestinal glove may react by stopping you from absorbing as much of the ingredients. So, instead of running it through your gastro"}
{"text": "Question: Lets assume its keratosis pilaris.Are there any pharmaceutical options to treat this? \n ### Answer: Such as retinoids, lasers, etc. Or any products we can make for her to do at home that will rapidly exfoliate the affected skin? If they call her in, do you have any recommendations that could work over time, for the entire body, like a high% salicylic acid product? When done, can a laser permanently fix this?\n\nKeratosis pilaris is not a medical disease and therefore is not a offered therapy with medical insurances. Keratosis pilaris is a hereditary result of a keratinization dysfunction in the pilosebaceous glands that are located on the dermis of all skin. Keratosis pilaris is manifested as projections from the pores as the entire pores are keratinized and it result in the sebaceous gland ducts blocked and an accumulation of sebum and keratin in these follicles. Cystic retention causes the follicles to become inflamed and develops redness around the follicle opening. Keratosis pilaris could move from mild to moderate in 4 weeks time.\n\nKeratosis pilaris might occur at any age\u2013from childhood to adult. The presence of keratosis pilaris may serve as a signal for an accompanying eczema or allergen contact dermatitis.\n\nKeratosis pilaris is a very difficult disorder to deal with. In spite of using medical and cosmetic treatments, it is very usual for keratosis pilaris to not respond. Hydration is vital for the therapy for keratosis pilaris. Medically, it is possibly the best chosen treatment. Hydrocolloid products that contains glycerin also works well to hydrate keratosis pilaris and prevent its advance. Topical retinoids are rarely recommended to a patient with keratosis pilaris during the summer season, when most house and office are basically constantly air-conditioned to a cooler temperature level.\n\nChemical peels have been used infrequently to treat advanced keratosis pilaris, because it could perhaps cause hyperpigmentation and transient dermatitis on the affected skin. From the professional point of view, we cannot think that one particular chemical laser peel would remove keratosis pilaris permanently (also not if Utilized for more"}

{"text": "Question: What does a low pulse possibly indicate? \n ### Answer: A fast pulse, on the other hand, is generally not desirable, but there are some situations when it is! Let\u2019s dive in to learn more about it!\n\n## What Causes Low Pulse?\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for reduced HR, but everything begins with the situation of your body. A low HR may indicate a reduction in stress, considering that an elevated pulse is frequently associated with stress. If you have a low heart rate at rest, you\u2019re not going to be as active and therefore less stressed.\n\n### Exercise\n\nYour last cardio workout may have included a lengthy period of steady-state exercise. This will take time for your body to recover. During the cooldown, a muscle known as the coronary vein will be chilled. Your heart rate is regulated via the coronary vein. When the temperature is low, the blood circulating via the coronary vein is cooled, and the temperature of the blood flowing through the vein decreases if you walk for more than nearly 30 minutes.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re in excellent physical shape, your pulse should be higher than a typical pulse. In order to efficiently get oxygen into the bloodstream, circulation needs to be outstanding.\n\n### Medication and Supplements\n\nOne of the most frequent reasons for a low pulse is prescription drugs like beta-blockers, such as beta-blockers:\n\n- Propranolol\n- Metoprolol\n- Carteolol\n- Atenolol\n\nIf you\u2019re already on certain prescription medications like beta-blockers, you\u2019ll experience a reduced pulse.\n\nThis change in pulse is a sign of a properly functioning medication that is sustaining the quality of your life. Multiple medical circumstances, including thyroid issues, hypothyroidism, and bradycardia, might be alleviated by some forms of beta-blockers that lower heart rate and blood force. Anyone might obtain some of these drugs\u2019 benefits for high blood stress, calm nerves, migraines, and diabetic nephropathy.\n\nAs medications start to work, heart rate and blood pressure may drop. This has a stabilizing impact on our health. You\u2019ll feel better and less anxious if your heart rate or blood pressure drops.\n\n## What are the Side Effects of a Low Pulse?\n\nIf you"}

This is why so many customers are confused as to whether they should select Advil or Advil. You\u2019ve been given the right response if you select Advil. When Advil is administered, the sodium bicarbonate allows the medication to go into the person\u2019s system more quickly and effectively, and the name of the medicine references this component, which is why its name was named Advil.\n\nThe truth is that while Advil and Advil may work quite similarly, it has been discovered that because they have slightly different components, one brand may work slightly better for women, whereas the other will operate better for men.\n\nWhat Is The Optimal Length Of Time To Take Advil?\n\nFor nerve pain and a variety of other various diseases, Advil is a very successful drug, though once you\u2019ve started taking the drug, you\u2019ll want to continue taking it for the three months.\n\nIf you typically take Advil prescribed medication, you may have wondered at some point during your treatment, \u201c"}

However, if flares are persistent and medical therapies fail, prednisone doses up to approximately 20 mg/day have been deemed safe during the first trimester for use in women struggling to keep their colitis under control.^{1} While corticosteroids are known for transplacental transfer, thus affecting the unborn foetus, this specific data is contradictory.

{"text": "Question: Whats good for muscular pain? \n ### Answer: Which is better for pain, ibuprofen or Tylenol?\n\nI have muscle aches. How can I feel better?\n\nWhen you have muscular or joint pain, it is likely that at least one of these drugs was recommended by your doctor for pain relief. Advil and Tylenol are the most common over-the-counter pain pills listed in my patients\u2019 medication lists.\n\n## Ibuprofen found to be gentler on the gut than a common painkiller\n\nBut despite its ubiquity, how did Advil get to be a part of so many treatment plans?\n\nThough available as a nonprescription drug, Advil is actually sold as the generic ibuprofen (or by other brand names). It was first approved by the FDA in 1974 as a prescription drug for the treatment of muscular and joint pain. You may be surprised to learn that ibuprofen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, or NSAID. Its effect on pain is actually secondary to how it reduces inflammation.\n\nMany patients mistakenly assume NSAIDS only relieve pain.\n\nI recently worked up a treatment plan that included ibuprofen for a patient who has a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Surprisingly, he thought Advil would probably make him feel worse because it was a pain pill, and he didn\u2019t want to risk having his symptoms flare up. In fact, not only does ibuprofen help to relieve the pain from his condition, it also reduces the inflammation that aggravates his Chrohn\u2019s disease.\n\n## New study shows pain pills gentler on the gut\n\nAlthough ibuprofen is a stronger anti-inflammatory drug than Tylenol, it is one of very few NSAIDS that has been proven in medical research to be a safer bet for patients with a history of stomach problems.\n\nThis month\u2019s issue of Gastroenterology carries an interesting study that compares ibuprofen and Tylenol for the treatment of GERD related heartburn.

{"text": "Question: Whats the difference between Valtrex and Acyclovir? \n ### Answer: Valacyclovir is the prodrug of Acyclovir, meaning it is converted to acyclovir during metabolism. Acyclovir is then converted to acyclic acid. The fact that valacyclovir hydrolyses to acyclovir means that during metabolism, there are two possible sites of deactivation of the drug (acyclovir and valacyclovir). Acyclovir is extensively deactivated by human plasma esterases, whereas Valacyclovir is less prone to deactivation than Acylovir (Gardner and Monroe, 1984). The major difference between acyclovir and valacyclovir is in their dosages. Since Valacyclovir has a longer half-life than acyclovir, lower dosages can be used during treatment of HSV 1.\n\nAre antivirals the same as antimicrobials?\n\nAntimicrobial generally refers to agents that kill germs, like some antivirals. They might be antibiotics that target bacteria, or antivirals, or antifungals, etc, to treat infections. Some antivirals are used in high doses to kill microorganisms. An example would be valacyclovir that has a secondary use as an antimicrobial and has been used in super-high doses to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria in the blood. Antivirals are also mainly used in higher doses for bactericidal purposes like killing moulds.\n\nWhen should I use the anti-microbial tool for?\n\nValacyclovir, famciclovir, aciclovir and penciclovir are antiviral agents first and foremost. They should only be used against bacteria in high doses as an antibacterial agent on the recommendation of an expert. Acyclovir does not have a gram-positive antibacterial activity, it would take 10 times the dose of acyclovir for an immune-compromised patient to achieve the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed for gram-positive bacteria, like staph, to be killed.\n\nWhat are the non-antimicrobial side-effects of Valacyclovir?\n\nValacycl"}

The antibiotic often kills both good and bad bacteria and also depletes the intestinal flora.\n\nA gastroenterologist specializes in treating patients with age-related bowel constipation problems.  He warned his patients to avoid most of the literally hundreds of commonly prescribed drugs that are known to cause digestive tract constipation problems.  Most patients assumed that if a doctor wants them to have a particular drug, it must be good for them, and they never questioned taking it, except in the rare situations where this digestive problem caused acute life-threatening pain and agony.\n\nMany people report their digestive problems are worse than ever now that they\u2019ve eliminated drinking alcohol.  One of the major causes is constipation that never permitted the dark colors and residue in wine to pass through.\n\nAn acquaintance told me that he was constipated all his life and feared colorectal cancer.

Before all people were afraid that it was more likely to spread herpes that I had with the kissing technique and other activities that were more likely to transmit the disease than intercourse. I was even being discriminated by some people because afraid to be touching me.\n\nBut how do we defend ourselves against a herpes infection? First of all, we all need to know the basic facts about the disease. Only that way will we be able to protect ourselves.\n\nMost of us know that herpes progresses in stages. In the first stage the virus gets carried into our body through the starting point \u2013 the open sores on the skin, mucous membranes, or the pathways that carry these substances into the body, like the mouth or genital opening.\n\nThen, in the second stage, the virus migrates to the central nervous system, where it establishes a permanent home \u2013 the ganglia. That also explains why after the initial bout of herpes cold sores took so long to return..\n\nIn the third and final stage, the virus crosses from the ganglia back to the original entry point through the nerve endings .Once the virus crosses the nerve endings, the virus travels back to the original site through the lymphatic system. I know it was enough for me to vomit just with that information, so give yourself a minute before going any further!!!\n\nWell, this is the actual progression of the disease.\n\nThe virus can find it\u2019s way to the ganglia through at least three pathways. One of them is possible initial exposure through contact\u2013for example, when the mouth or the eye comes into contact with the hands of an already infected person. This requires direct contact.

{"text": "Question: does a corneal abrasion usually cause discharge from the eye? \n ### Answer: Hello Hazel:\n\nWhat you describe sounds a lot like blepharitis. The redness in one eye, the crusty matter and the feeling of wanting to constantly rub the eyes would all be consistent with an upper lid or lower lid blepharitis. Normally there would be no discharge, but some people seem to product discharge as a result of blepharitis. I would speak with your eye doctor to go over what is happening. If your doctor finds nothing else after a careful examination, you might consider a short course of a good antibiotic ointment that you could apply to the eye lid margin twice each day to see if that helps.\n\nHello Hazel:\n\nIt would be unusual for a corneal abrasion to produce a discharge but your red eye may be the result of irritating material like a tiny hair or eyelash. These irritants tend to be produced from rubbing the eye with your fingers or when cleaning the eye with a cotton swab. Aside from an eye examination, the best way to determine a true corneal abrasion from something you might have out of your eye is for your eye doctor to stain the front of your eye with a special dye such as fluorescein. He would then review the results of the stain with you. The answer would determine the treatment needed. The good news is that even if you do have a corneal abrasion, if you have had it for a short time, it is usually self-healing. Should you have any discomfort or redness that is not getting better, you need to see your eye doctor.\n\nThis article appeared in the April 2010 issue of OPHTHALMOLOGY TODAY."}
