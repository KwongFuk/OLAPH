{"Question": "What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease?", "Free_form_answer": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.

How the PCRD related to Noonan syndrome? Or how does a kid title of this condition to anyone with Noonan syndrome or is this a general thing for males/females? Will they take the kidneys out? Can they prevent the blockage in the kidneys coming back?\n\nDon\u2019t worry. Nothing\u2019s going to happen until your son turns 18, and a physician will only do the surgery if, at that time, he thinks it\u2019s going to be beneficial, i.e., if there are ongoing complications. Usually, but not inevitably, such surgery requires dialysis and often a transplant, on a longer term basis, and because it seems like overtreatment unless absolutely needed, for as long as your son\u2019s kidney function is adequate, you can expect to avoid it. Who knows? Maybe his entire life he will not have this condition without ever having it addressed. If it does become problematic and the physician you see believes that it will relieve your son\u2019s condition, some individuals they see do well with it. Just as with so many things relating to NS, if I were to give you a number percentage wise I would simply be assuming for the moment, The History of Sensations and Symptoms we have don\u2019t really reflect the future. So, my advice \u201crelax\u201d.", "Noonan syndrome is a congenital disorder that\u2019s associated with multiple anomalies, such as severe systemic hemorrhage, congenital heart disease, pulmonary valve hypertrophy, pulmonary stenosis, and cardiomyopathy.\n\nCongenital heart disease occurs in two-thirds of Noonan syndrome cases, older studies have shown.\n\nThese findings pertaining to Noonan\u2019s syndrome also apply to cases of Noonan\u2019s syndrome with polycatric occlusive disease (PAML1-NC).\n\nIt is also a known fact that polycystic renal disease increases the risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCD) in patients with Noonan syndrome.\n\nLike Noonan syndrome, polycystic renal disease is also an autosomal recessive genetic disorder.\n\n## What are polycystic kidney disease and Noonan\u2019s Syndrome?\n\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is defined as an interruption in motile movement of small metabolically-expanded secreted kaolin-containing astroilic dysplasias in the kidneys.\n\nThe disease is usually associated with the formation of large multicystic structures in the kidneys, which may involve the nerves and blood vessels of the lower limbs.\n\nPKD typically occurs after the onset of pregnancy. Once established, it can cause a number of problems including infection and kidney failure.\n\nIn many cases, PKD is not diagnosed during childhood or early adulthood.\n\nThe finding that PKD can lead to heart failure and death within a few months of diagnosis is contentious.\n\nOne reason for this diagnostic uncertainty is the lack of a quick and reliable way to test for the presence or absence of PKD or PKV.\n\nIn fact, there are many PKD-implicated genes that are not mutated in anyone with PKD.\n\nMany of the patients who have not been diagnosed with PKD either have a mutation in one of several PKG gene codes, or they have an unknown gene that codes for a functionally different protein as part of their polycystic kidney disease.\n\nFor these patients, however, the presence of another major gene, known as polycystin 5 (or PC5)", "It\u2019s hard to imagine, but it actually exists.\n\nRecently, scientists have found a novel role of Pitt Hopkins syndrom related to congenital horizontal genetic disorder therapy NF1-associated mosaic renal cystic disease.\n\nThe clinical features of patients with this disease are kidney cysts in very early childhood (6-12 months old), normal kidney function and development. However, symptoms like typical Noonan syndrome and urogenital dysmorphogenesis were not observed.\n\nAccording to the original phenotypic analysis, polycystic kidney disease caused by deletion of the gene is a rare phenomena in PHS. However, it boasts certain diagnosability, therapeutic effect and prognosis. Most importantly, the disease does not include the classic psychological changes, such as interventional PAINDHCNS immune tolerance reactions, treatment of urticaria, etc.\n\nNoonan syndrome leads to congenital horizontal genetic disorder\n\nIn China, people under the age of 65 are also beginning to focus on the pathogenic mechanism of rare syndromic diseases. In fact, rare syndromes have always existed among us. Some are surprisingly common, such as Down\u2019s syndrome, imperative fibers and hydrophobic nevus syndrome, etc.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that about 1-2 newborns per 1,000 people suffer from mutations or translocations. The incidence is high. According to statistics, more than 7,000 people have this disease in the country. However, this disease often occurs in European and North American studies, with a lower incidence in Asian Australasia. Scientists find that there are 7-8 types of patients, and they are more common in White.\n\nA puzzled doctor\n\nDoctor Jiang \u2013 a white Chinese, felt sad when he received the original publication of foreign scholars. This is a case report, and the patient\u2019s phenotype \u2013 congenital horizontal genetic anomaly, to be honest, the doctor is not familiar with the disease.\n\nThinking back, in the past two years, Doctors Jiang met many children with holes in their heart, one of whom he managed.In fact, he met children with preoperative heart disease and pericardium, left aspergic artery, ab", "Through her research, pediatric nephrologist and clinical geneticist Martha Earnest, MD, is finding out.\n\nWhat is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease? Through her research, pediatric nephrologist and clinical geneticist Martha Earnest, MD, is finding out.\n\nNoonan syndrome occurs when a gene on chromosome 12, called the PTPN11 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-receptor Type 11) gene, mutates. The mutation causes children to be born with defects including short stature; cone-shaped nose; cryptorchidism (undescended testes in boys); and poor muscle tone. Noonan syndrome can also lead to the development of tumors in various organs, especially cancer of the skin or thyroid.\n\nIn Dr. Earnest\u2019s studies, Noonan syndrome patients are screened for kidney cysts. Many children with Noonan syndrome develop cysts in their kidneys secondary to polycystic kidney disease, the most common inherited disease that causes fluid-filled kidney cysts.\n\n\u201cPolycystic kidney disease leads to kidney failure and, currently, there is no known way to slow progression of the disease,\u201d said Dr. Earnest. \u201cMany childhood illnesses have no known cure, and an early diagnosis is crucial in order to treat and manage the associated symptoms. Our current research focuses on further investigation of the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic kidney disease. It is critically important to conduct research on the disease because we are learning new things and lead the way to a better tomorrow for these patients.\u201d\n\nAt Cincinnati Children\u2019s, Dr. Earnest and her team are seeing more patients with Noonan syndrome and, at a younger age, many have kidney cysts. Although the results have been inconclusive at this point, Dr. Earnest is optimistic.\n\n\u201cCurrently, we do not have an answer, but we are looking,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Noonan syndrome presents with cysts, patients face a new set of challenges:\n\n- Growth hormone resistance\n- Hypotension (low blood pressure)\n- Poor blood clotting\n- Through Dr. E", "polycystic renal disease an autosomal recessive contiguous gene syndrome affecting families from North West England Involves combined bilateral multicystic dysplasia and unilateral renal agenesis Contiguous gene deletion involving chromosomes 1 and 12 Deletions involve chromosomes 7p21.3p22.1, 12p11.212p13.32, and 19p13.13 Involve a distinct genetic locus 2q11pter-q13Noonan syndrome (NS)is a multicentric condition defined by the presence of pleural pterygia and other abnormalities that are mainlyreminiscent of facies in a small heart. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a contiguous gene syndromecaused by an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and a continuous linkage between chromosomes 1and 12. Three phenotypic forms are recognized: Noonan syndrome (NS); Klein-Weller-Wieselmann Over time, the combination of polycystic kidney disease and tumor-causing genes lead to the evolution of a single gene defect in this syndrome. Clinical markers include somatic kidney greasy cysts and renal papillary necrosis with a decrease in renal function. The gene for this syndrome was genetically mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7. Another similar condition affecting the genitourinary system in North West England is Varicocele, a condition characterized by a vasoconstriction associated with a parasure in flow. This decrease impedes the drainage of blood to the spermatic veins, which are necessary to drain the spermatozoa from a closed tubular compartment. Such compressions stimulate contractions of the stroma, creating a local inflammatory response with gelatinous material secreted. This leads to hydrocele formation and reduces sperm production, resulting in male genitalia hypoplasia. One of the main differences between Noonan syndrome and conditions caused bycontiguous genes is the presence of kidney cysts in the person with NS whereas SS seems to be asymptomatic.

Muscle and liver cells need insulin to regulate the amount of sugar inside the cells.

Since there is no sugar inside cells, they are in a state of lack; this lack is otherwise known as glycogen\n\n\u200b\n\nGlycogen, the \u201cfuel reserve,\u201d is stored in the liver and muscles. Hormones like glucagon and cortisol are signals from the brain to the liver and muscles when people have low blood sugar. This triggers the release of glycogen to be processed into glucose.

Each vial contains one 1 mg single-use dose that should be reconstituted with one 1 mL diluent syringe containing 1 mg/mL glucagon diluent for intramuscular (IM) injection in a new syringe and needle.\n\nUsage\n- In the event of hypoglycemia in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, immediate treatment is required.\n- IM or SC injections of glucagon in the anterolateral thigh muscle should be used as the first-line therapy. IM injection in the deltoid muscle or gluteal muscle may be an alternative but may take longer to be effective. IM injection in the thigh muscle has been consistently associated with a more rapid decrease in plasma glucose as compared to IM injection in other muscle site. IV injection of glucagon should be considered for those who have an inadequate response to IM glucagon injection.\n- The faster decline of plasma glucose generally occurs within 15 minutes after glucagon injection and lasts a minimum of 30 minutes. Other methods of diabetes management may include oral administration of mouth glucose, and continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition.\n- A neurosurgical patient receiving a general anesthetic affected by large doses of catecholamine is at greater risk for disturbed myocardial perfusion and may have more extensive myocardial damage with the administration of glucagon.\n- The vessel accessible or the nearest one should depend upon the site of injection. If access is impossible, the appropriate vein should be deemed and the needle inserted primarily into the vein and the vessel. In case of abdominal vessel instication of glucagon, precaution must be taken not to injure the major or minor vessels.\n- A glucagon compound should be administered following 0.5 mL of 1% aqueous sodium"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3846, "rouge1_r": 0.0446, "rouge1_f1": 0.08, "rouge2_p": 0.04, "rouge2_r": 0.0045, "rouge2_f1": 0.0081, "rougel_p": 0.3846, "rougel_r": 0.0446, "rougel_f1": 0.08, "bleurt": 0.6216, "bert_score_p": 0.7515, "bert_score_r": 0.7499, "bert_score_f1": 0.7507, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4615, "rouge1_r": 0.039, "rouge1_f1": 0.0719, "rouge2_p": 0.08, "rouge2_r": 0.0065, "rouge2_f1": 0.012, "rougel_p": 0.3077, "rougel_r": 0.026, "rougel_f1": 0.0479, "bleurt": 0.2842, "bert_score_p": 0.7716, "bert_score_r": 0.7765, "bert_score_f1": 0.774, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3462, "rouge1_r": 0.0279, "rouge1_f1": 0.0516, "rouge2_p": 0.04, "rouge2_r": 0.0031, "rouge2_f1": 0.0058, "rougel_p": 0.2308, "rougel_r": 0.0186, "rougel_f1": 0.0344, "bleurt": 0.3121, "bert_score_p": 0.7827, "bert_score_r": 0.7802, "bert_score_f1": 0.7815, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5769, "rouge1_r": 0.0439, "rouge1_f1": 0.0815, "rouge2_p": 0.08, "rouge2_r": 0.0059, "rouge2_f1": 0.0109, "rougel_p": 0.4615, "rougel_r": 0.0351, "rougel_f1": 0.0652, "bleurt": 0.3227, "bert_score_p": 0.7771, "bert_score_r": 0.7897, "bert_score_f1": 0.7834, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5385, "rouge1_r": 0.0422, "rouge1_f1": 0.0782, "rouge2_p": 0.12, "rouge2_r": 0.0091, "rouge2_f1": 0.0169, "rougel_p": 0.3846, "rougel_r": 0.0301, "rougel_f1": 0.0559, "bleurt": 0.3208, "bert_score_p": 0.7786, "bert_score_r": 0.7839, "bert_score_f1": 0.7812, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.0404, "rouge1_f1": 0.0747, "rouge2_p": 0.08, "rouge2_r": 0.0062, "rouge2_f1": 0.0116, "rougel_p": 0.3846, "rougel_r": 0.0311, "rougel_f1": 0.0575, "bleurt": 0.3008, "bert_score_p": 0.7743, "bert_score_r": 0.7847, "bert_score_f1": 0.7795, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

The researchers found that patients who received general anesthesia were 35% more likely to develop dementia than those who received spinal anesthesia.\n\nThe researchers believe that the reason for this increased risk is that general anesthesia can cause inflammation in the brain, which can lead to cognitive decline.\n\nThis study is important because it highlights the potential risks of general anesthesia, especially for older adults. It is important for patients to discuss the risks and benefits of general anesthesia with their doctor before undergoing surgery.\n\nIf you or a loved one is scheduled for hip replacement surgery, be sure to discuss the risks and benefits of general anesthesia with your doctor.\n\n## What is FXTAS?\n\nFXTAS is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by an expansion of the FMR1 gene. This gene is located on the X chromosome and is responsible for producing the protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).\n\nFXTAS is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, as well as a variety of other neurological symptoms. These symptoms can include tremors, gait disturbances, and problems with balance and coordination.\n\nFXTAS is most commonly seen in men over the age of 50, but it can also occur in women. The disorder is thought to be caused by an expansion of the FMR1 gene, which results in the production of an abnormal form of FMRP.\n\nFXTAS is a progressive disorder, meaning that the symptoms will get worse over time. There is no cure for FXTAS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.\n\nIf you or a loved one is diagnosed with FXTAS, it is important to seek out treatment from a qualified healthcare provider. There are a number of different treatments that can help to manage the symptoms of FXTAS, and each person will", "The short answer is there is insufficient knowledge to address whether anesthesia could affect FXTAS patients differently than it does unaffected males. It is a question that has never, to my knowledge, been explored. There is also significantly less known about the stress response during surgical procedures and in patients with FXTAS than in cognitively normal, unaffected patients.\n\nA study, \u201cEffect of intraoperative propofol infusion on the short-term cognitive function of healthy elderly,\u201d presented in the Journal Behavioural Brain Research examines the impact of short-term propofol exposure during surgery in healthy older adults. Initially, results suggested that healthy older adults may be more susceptible to a negative impact on cognitive function after propofol exposure than younger adults. Anesthesia appears to impact attention and cognitive ability more so in healthy older adults, this study suggests, but possibly not in disproportionate fashion than is already known. The study was conducted in China.\n\nSurgical procedure has long been known to have an impact (positive or negative) on cognitive function in unaffected patients. In recent years it has become a popular topic for research and a concern for anesthesiologists and cognitively normal, healthy, patients, as well. Increasingly, the exposure to drugs during a surgical procedure has been studied for viability as a tool for enhancing memory and resilience to brain dysfunction. Still, the effects of anesthesia on the brain remain largely unexplored and an ominous risk factor with uncertain consequences. The FIRST Foundation is actively seeking research in this area.\n\nThe study investigates cognition in healthy patients, unaffected by advanced repeat expansion syndromes or other genetic brain disease. How and to what extent the same drugs or similar drugs affect the brain of a patient with FXTAS, or a Rett syndrome patient, or Parkinson patient, or Alzheimer patient, for example, is unknown. We are increasingly considering the possibility that anesthesia may be a negative stressor for vulnerable individuals during a period of physiologic stress.\n\nAnother study, \u201cFactors associated with short-term and long-term cognitive impairment after major surgery,\u201d provides a contrasting perspective of the impact of surgery on cognition.

My wife has been living with FXATS for years. Already many vitaltools had been discovered by Wright State University\u2019s Dr. David Hessl and his team, which were benefitting my wife. The PET and SPECT scans by Dr. Zhou were expanding those diagnostic capabilities. All of those brilliant men with their teams, were working hard on developing \"FXATS specific tools\", though none were amenable to peer review, again because no replica case had presented to date and they themselves could not produce one. This did not stop thousands of individuals with FXATS from seeking them to help their loved ones, who exhibited minor symptoms and were living with the possible challenges of FXTAS.\n\nDuring our visit to Dr.David Hessl\u2019s team in Dayton Ohio, we felt good knowing so many bright scientific minds were working in a collaborative manner toward a diagnosis for my wife and the community they serve.

DVT occur when a blood clot forms in a vein deep in the body, usually in the legs. PE are caused when a blood clot that breaks off and travels through the venous system, lodging in an artery in the lung where it blocks blood flow to the lungs. The most common symptom of DVT is swelling in one leg (at times both) which is not accompanied by pain, but can actually feel quite tender. PE can cause cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid breathing. These symptoms can also be caused by other less-serious conditions, such as infections and allergic reactions.

Researchers have yet to identify the exact underlying reason for this increased risk for Deep Ve", "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms within a vein deep inside the body. These most often occur in the thigh, pelvis or leg, usually the calf. Our bodies typically circulate blood via the arteries (which provide all the oxygen and nutrients to our vital organs and muscles) and return it through the veins. Venous blood has two main jobs: 1) returning deoxygenated blood to the lungs for reoxygenation and 2) returning oxygen and nutrients from intestinal absorption. Dating back possibly thousands of years ago, the first account of DVT was discussed by Hippocrates, an early Greek physician. He coined the symptom \u201cphlegma tetax haima\u201d which translates \u201cleg phlegm moving with the blood\u201d which describes a potential clot moving in the veins of a patient\u2019s leg.\nDVT symptoms are a result of blood clots blocking the venous circulation to our legs and potentially causing damage to blood capillaries and venous circulation responsible for carrying oxygenated blood out of the body. The presence of DVT can result in tissue death and permanent disability or even cause death of the patient. DVT can also result in blood clots forming in the lungs resulting in pulmonary embolism which carries significant morbidity and mortality risk. Our body is very talented at forming blood clots in order to stop bleeding from lacerations. The normal cascade of events involves coagulation proteins activating, which aggregate a clotting cascade and forms a clot that seals, traps and helps the bleeding to stop. This is all a very necessary response in order to stop bleeding and to aid the healing process but, speaks to the fact that blood clots are not formed without reason.\n\n> Taking a \u201csynthetic\u201d form of estrogen has the ability to trigger clotting factors which increases the risk to develop DVT.\n\nClotting factors such as Factor IX (also known as Christmas factor), Factor X, and fibrinogen will be currently circulating in our blood supply and ready to form.

Manufacturers claim that Ocella is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.\n\nOcella is a branded version of the birth control drug Drospirenone. Drospirenone\u2019s purpose is the same: to create conditions unsuitable for sperm to survive inside a woman\u2019s body. Drospirenone-based birth control pills have been prescribed in the past as effective ways to reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancies.\n\nYour doctor or pharmacist may have mentioned certain side effects to you before prescribing. Now, numerous court cases have raised concerns that Ocella and Drospirenone could pose life-altering severe or side effects in some women who use it.\n\n## Can Ocella be Life-Threatening?\n\nWomen injured by Ocella recently filed a lawsuit in a US District Court (Madison County, Illinois) claiming that the owners of Ocella and a subsidiary that makes the medication could be found negligent for not labelling a potentially life-threatening medical condition that affects some women who use the drug.\n\nThe honourable Judge Robert M. Doub appointed Coastal Carolina University Business Professor Jacques Rubin as decertification expert. Rubin warns that women who suffer a life-altering injury from Ocella could have a challenge joining an existing lawsuit in order to receive compensation. This is because class action products liability cases that were previously consolidated into the original class action\u2019s multi-district litigation(MDL) have since been decertified.\n\nThe convenience and economy of the litigation eventually deferred in favour of allowing individual lawsuits to be filed. This, of course, increases the associated costs.\n\n## Are There Any Lawsuits Against Ocella?\n\nLitigation over Ocella is continuing against the defendants of this lawsuit \u2014 Teva Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Healthcare, and Barr Laboratories. The plaintiff, Selma Hernandez, was awarded $3 million in cheapest Viagra compensation for suffering from an unreported medical condition.

It is an infection of the urinary tract, which includes the bladder, urethra, and kidneys.\n\n## What are the symptoms of a UTI?\n\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary depending on the severity of the infection. The most common symptoms include:\n\n-Pain or burning when urinating\n-Frequent urination\n-Urine that is cloudy or has a strong odor\n-Pain in the lower abdomen or back\n-Fever\n-Nausea and vomiting\n\n## What are the causes of a UTI?\n\nThere are many causes of a UTI, but the most common is a bacterial infection. Other causes include viral infections, fungal infections, and parasitic infections.\n\n## How is a UTI diagnosed?\n\nA UTI is diagnosed by a doctor who will ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. The doctor may also order a urine test to check for bacteria.\n\n## How is a UTI treated?\n\nA UTI is treated with antibiotics. The type of antibiotic and the length of treatment will depend on the severity of the infection.\n\n## What are the complications of a UTI?\n\nThe most common complication of a UTI is a kidney infection. A kidney infection can lead to permanent kidney damage if it is not treated promptly. Other complications of a UTI include:\n\n-Urinary tract obstruction\n-Urinary incontinence\n-Urinary retention\n-Urinary tract stones\n\n## How can a UTI be prevented?\n\nThere are several things you can do to prevent a UTI:\n\n-Drink plenty", "The only drug suitable for a UTI is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding is azithromycin.

Other times, the suspension of symptoms may also lead to symptoms that may be lost (for example, the ability to concentrate or the inability to focus).\n\nJust follow the same course of action for the UTI, and please discuss this with your doctor about whether any changes to the medication are needed.

Perhaps what you have been taking does not cover the specific types of bacteria that cause your UTI. Or you may be allergic to the antibiotics. Zithromax and Levaquin are also effective for treatment of UTI.

All these I tried to hide from my husband, even from my closest child, for reasons? (In principle. Our relationship is always good.) Fast forward to about 2018-2019. My throat hurts again. But I can\u2019t sleep and sleep. In fact, I embossed my throat. About half my abdomen was gone. I crumpled and felt a lot of pain in my groin.

Appendicyshv, My doctor is in the city of Larnaca, Cyprus, and he insists that his surgery does not need to be done again.\n\nIn 2018, I was diagnosed with syphilis (Leshter-Tremer). At the time, the laboratory test was positive. I began to take antibiotics (first penicillin), but I was unable to take it for more than one month (a week due to allergies). In 2018, I also learned that the standard weight-gain standards should be removed, and at the time I had lost about 9 kg, although I had always thought that this should have been invasive.\n\nIn my family, my mother also looked in this direction, and too often", "No.  Strep cases are by far the most common reason for sore throats.  This is accurately reflective in the reported cases.\n\nI have had sore throats for the past one and a half years and it is happening too frequently. There seems to be no doctor who has not given me antibiotics and none of them has worked. I have lost so much weight that I do not even recognise myself now. I am 37 years old and I look like an old man. What should I do?\n\nThis is a most worrisome problem indeed and I believe that you have been bouncing around the merry-go-round.  Often our most difficult medical cases end up looking like yours.\n\nYou have possibly developed a condition called a sub-optimal immune response known as debility.  In layman's language it means a very sick individual who is usually old in the person's lifestyle and or stress.  It is like you get a very bad cold and cough worse than what goes around.  This is not a strep infection.\n\nYou will not get better till you find the right answers with doctor who should run various tests and arrive at the conclusion that you may be suffering from debility.  I am not saying that streps do not occur but from your description it sounds as though there is more to this story.  There are tests for this such as an Epstein Barr test (EBV) and others.  If they are all negative, which I doubt, the even if strep tests are positive it is imperative that the doctor ought to get to the deep answer for you.  You will not get better on antibiotics alone.\n\nNow for you to get better in a worst case scenario you willto have to take thyroxin to boost your hormones for three months, a B-complex vitamin three times a day, and other tests not described here.  It is very likely that this is not it; you will have to find a doctor who understands and treats you properly.\n\nThis is a serious condition and I would not venture to give you a 100%guarantee yet even though most I think will get well over time.  Get a doctor who understands this and treats you as if you are serious.", "I recently had a strep infection and am now having GI issues. What is your professional opinion please.\n\nIf you have ulcers, then it could be that they are the result of some immune-mediated process brought on by poorly controlled Strep.\n\nI would go to a specialist to find out if ulcers or stomach problems are the result of Strep.\n\nPersonally, I have gut issues that I think are about 50% the result of being ecologically out of balance due to meds, viruses, etc., and perhaps just chronically high acidity levels (which meds lower your acidity to allow them to be digested), and 50% the results of keeping up with three boys and too much stress in general.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t believe ulcers are autoimmune.\n\nIBD and Colitis are presumed to be but intelligently, I think that\u2019s just because doctors aren\u2019t usually treating them with only nutrients and drainage remedies.\n\nMost likely, by treating the individual person as a unique creature and not a bucket to pour endless amounts of Symlin into, they\u2019d be treated the same as my Crohn\u2019s is \u2014 without flare ups or treatments, aside from perhaps some \u201cspecial\u201d remedies if it blows out of control.\n\nThe Kaufmann\u2019s diet probably also does a lot to reduce inflammation in the pancreas to make it work better.\n\nPancreatitis is certainly very painful whether autoimmune or not.\n\nNausea is also irritating and could be a result of just inflammation in general that the gut is putting up with and doesn\u2019t want to keep going through.\n\nPickling for 4 days can kill Strep if there is Strep to begin with. Otherwise, a bowel cleanse can help flush out any old Strep in the system.\n\nA widespread health problem would be interesting to research, since dairy, gluten, and processed foods are bad for your stomach and overall body health.\n\nI would be curious to see what in dairy is a problem, if a known Strep is present, as I use dairy in my diet daily and have not had a problem as long as I have, which will be 11 years before VANG is approved.\n\nThe debates are many,"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1392, "rouge1_r": 0.0238, "rouge1_f1": 0.0407, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1013, "rougel_r": 0.0173, "rougel_f1": 0.0296, "bleurt": 0.3753, "bert_score_p": 0.7422, "bert_score_r": 0.7946, "bert_score_f1": 0.7675, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4177, "rouge1_r": 0.132, "rouge1_f1": 0.2006, "rouge2_p": 0.0385, "rouge2_r": 0.012, "rouge2_f1": 0.0183, "rougel_p": 0.2278, "rougel_r": 0.072, "rougel_f1": 0.1094, "bleurt": 0.3272, "bert_score_p": 0.7836, "bert_score_r": 0.8133, "bert_score_f1": 0.7982, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4557, "rouge1_r": 0.1314, "rouge1_f1": 0.204, "rouge2_p": 0.0385, "rouge2_r": 0.011, "rouge2_f1": 0.0171, "rougel_p": 0.2278, "rougel_r": 0.0657, "rougel_f1": 0.102, "bleurt": 0.2555, "bert_score_p": 0.7717, "bert_score_r": 0.8157, "bert_score_f1": 0.7931, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3165, "rouge1_r": 0.0742, "rouge1_f1": 0.1202, "rouge2_p": 0.0128, "rouge2_r": 0.003, "rouge2_f1": 0.0048, "rougel_p": 0.2025, "rougel_r": 0.0475, "rougel_f1": 0.0769, "bleurt": 0.2215, "bert_score_p": 0.7842, "bert_score_r": 0.8024, "bert_score_f1": 0.7932, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4177, "rouge1_r": 0.0859, "rouge1_f1": 0.1425, "rouge2_p": 0.0769, "rouge2_r": 0.0157, "rouge2_f1": 0.026, "rougel_p": 0.2405, "rougel_r": 0.0495, "rougel_f1": 0.0821, "bleurt": 0.2755, "bert_score_p": 0.7886, "bert_score_r": 0.8151, "bert_score_f1": 0.8016, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4051, "rouge1_r": 0.0879, "rouge1_f1": 0.1445, "rouge2_p": 0.0385, "rouge2_r": 0.0083, "rouge2_f1": 0.0136, "rougel_p": 0.2152, "rougel_r": 0.0467, "rougel_f1": 0.0767, "bleurt": 0.2479, "bert_score_p": 0.7838, "bert_score_r": 0.8052, "bert_score_f1": 0.7944, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

He now provides us with a monitor for the Dick Pountain article - have any errors been detected?\n\nThis instance is instructive.  The paper had a \"bad news\" bias for about 15 years in Nigeria.  As soon as elections are won by the opposition, then the structure must be \"corrupting\" the winners.

As they used PET scanners to determine the amount of plaque blocks or (but doesn\u2019t say if it was wet or dry) in their retina, those who had been exposed to secondhand smoke as children showed 35 percent more wet AMD around the edges of the macula. For patients who had smoked 10 or more years of their lives, they showed nearly twice the amount of plaque build-up around the center macula.\u201d\n\nSince that time doctors and scientists have done studies that show the link between drusen and smoking cigarettes but they never did a PET scan to see what was actually happening to the retina.\nI admit I smoked in excess of 2 per day when I had wet AMD. I quit cold turkey when I went to doc to get the EUA and Amsler grid and said to try to get that together, I will never smoke again and I refused to ever take steroids!

It is also noted that \u201cenvironmental tobacco smoke\u201d or passive smoke (breathing smoke when close to an individual who smokes) increases the risk of developing AMD and may cause the disease to progress at a faster rate.\n\nAlthough the results are mixed, studies do show that the incidence of AMD is higher among the nonsmoking spouse of those married to chronic smokers. The above raises serious questions regarding the impact of passive smoking (second hand), maintaining an environment free from tobacco smoke.

We investigated the relation between tobacco smoke exposure and the risk of AMD.\n\nMETHODS: Over 6 years, we studied 368 incident cases of AMD and 344 age-matched controls. Smoking status and estimated exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) were determined from in-person interviews. We assessed the incidence rates for ESRD-stage 5 and the causes for dialysis initiation using longitudinal data with central laboratory assays. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval. We calculated the absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to treat (NNT), and the Achan's nomogram to determine the incremental value of ESRD risk assessment and reduction approaches.\n\nRESULTS: Ever smokers had a higher male: female incidence rates of ESRD-stage 5 (11 and 1 per 100 person-year respectively) vs. never smokers (4 and 2 per 100 person-year, respectively, P for interaction = 0.14). Ever smokers had a higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence rates (21 per 100 person-year vs. 15 per 100 person-year, P = 0.045) and a higher overall incidence rate of ESRD (17 per 100 person-year vs. 9 per 100 person-year, P = 0.05) than never smokers. There was no interaction between CVD and smoking. Never-smokers exposed to high levels of ETS had a significant higher incidence rates of ESRD-stage 5 compared to never smoked unexposed (10 vs. 5 per 100 person-year, P = 0.25) and never smoked exposed to low levels of ETS (9 per 100 person-year, P = 0.62). Of the 347 552 dialyses initiated, CVD was the most common cause in 42653 (12.25%), gout in 2878 (0.8"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1408, "rouge1_r": 0.0216, "rouge1_f1": 0.0375, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1268, "rougel_r": 0.0194, "rougel_f1": 0.0337, "bleurt": 0.3904, "bert_score_p": 0.7151, "bert_score_r": 0.8114, "bert_score_f1": 0.7602, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.2676, "rouge1_r": 0.1496, "rouge1_f1": 0.1919, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.169, "rougel_r": 0.0945, "rougel_f1": 0.1212, "bleurt": 0.2644, "bert_score_p": 0.8159, "bert_score_r": 0.8368, "bert_score_f1": 0.8262, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.338, "rouge1_r": 0.1519, "rouge1_f1": 0.2096, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1549, "rougel_r": 0.0696, "rougel_f1": 0.0961, "bleurt": 0.1911, "bert_score_p": 0.8009, "bert_score_r": 0.8301, "bert_score_f1": 0.8152, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4648, "rouge1_r": 0.0801, "rouge1_f1": 0.1366, "rouge2_p": 0.0571, "rouge2_r": 0.0097, "rouge2_f1": 0.0166, "rougel_p": 0.2958, "rougel_r": 0.051, "rougel_f1": 0.087, "bleurt": 0.2106, "bert_score_p": 0.7863, "bert_score_r": 0.8524, "bert_score_f1": 0.8181, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.507, "rouge1_r": 0.0992, "rouge1_f1": 0.1659, "rouge2_p": 0.0714, "rouge2_r": 0.0138, "rouge2_f1": 0.0231, "rougel_p": 0.2958, "rougel_r": 0.0579, "rougel_f1": 0.0968, "bleurt": 0.2527, "bert_score_p": 0.7802, "bert_score_r": 0.8443, "bert_score_f1": 0.811, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3803, "rouge1_r": 0.0928, "rouge1_f1": 0.1492, "rouge2_p": 0.0143, "rouge2_r": 0.0034, "rouge2_f1": 0.0056, "rougel_p": 0.2394, "rougel_r": 0.0584, "rougel_f1": 0.0939, "bleurt": 0.2781, "bert_score_p": 0.7625, "bert_score_r": 0.8218, "bert_score_f1": 0.791, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

I had unprotected intercourse. The following month I got my period which was left for 2 days heavier than usual. The period stopped & I had 2 weeks of practically no flow whatsoever. Not even a spot of blood. I decided to go to the hospital to discuss. The midwife told me to book in at the maternity unit but I didn\u2019t want to because it felt like too much too soon. Something seemed strange & I was not quite right so I went to the walk-in centre with my mum who was worried about me. A doctor examined me & said that he felt the contents of my womb/uterus were attached to the wall & there was nothing he could do about it & that I would just have to wait & see. 3 days later I went for a bowel motion & noticed bleeding from my bottom. I went downstairs & asked for a doctor to be called & we later went back to the gp practice as I couldn\u2019t reach the hospital. This time I saw one of the gps & he sent me straight to the hospital while he called the staff there to let them know the gp had sent me over. When I got there, the staff took a sample of my womb contents & were shocked at how small it was. They said they were sending me home as they didn\u2019t want to waste a scan for me if I was going to have a miscarriage. I was sent home & my mum & my other half came to take me home. When I got home I changed my pad & sat looking in the mirror & I believed I saw a globule of some kind of matter in my pad. I immediately went to the washroom in our bedroom & went to look at it. It was very small but still size was not my main concern. It had a white, grey appearance, & had a very thick sticky consistency. It was syrupy & as I tipped it along to take it to a bin bag a brown ring began to form in the middle so I went back to the doctor who examined me to make sure, who then asked the hospital if I could have a scan there again. We were called back to the doctor by a nurse asap & her face was very shocked", "### 1.\n\nOne of the earliest events that a woman can experience in her pregnancy is the production of progesterone by the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)-secreteing endometrial cells that better prepare the uterus for implantation of a zygote or embryo by suppressing uterine lining that is no longer needed, and forming a more receptive body for the development of the fetus.\n\nPregnancy can be detected as early as 8 days after fertilization by the measurement of hCG; use of urine in this context is best since blood testing is not demonstrated until 15 days. Key hormone levels that make molar pregnancy likely are the presence of hCG + estrogen without progesterone. Estrogen is produced by the molar tissues, which contrasts sharply with the production of hCG and progesterone at 8 weeks in a normal pregnancy. Incomplete abortion often occurs prior to the diagnosis and therapy of molar pregnancy, and uncomplicated luteal phase deficiency to cause uterine bleeding can occur due to lack of progesterone and its protective effect on the uterine lining, but symptoms unrelated to menstruation include fatigue (59 %), lack of appetite (26 %), and more rarely asthenia, palpitation, lack of sleep, mild abdominal pain in the 1st trimester, and even more rarely, vomiting, hyperthyroidism, and hypertension.\n\nYour production stage, on average, is not that important. Recent reports have suggested that in roughly half of confirmed molar pregnancy cases, the key mistake involves a combination of genetic conditions, including fertilization of diploid (2 chromosomes) or triploid (3 chromosomes) abnormalities or nondisjunction that leads to no, aneuploid (abnormally containing more than one of a full set of chromosomes [23 in a normal individual]) cells or trisomic (3 chromosomal sets) placental abnormalities, or both. Current literature suggests a flat risk across all stages of reproductive age. That could be a shaky category.\n\nShort history of molar pregnancy\n\n- Accurate measurement of maternal chorionic gonadot", "Before a woman is aware that the egg of her ovaries has been fertilized, a molecular surgeon is actually capable of fertilizing the egg and her body has no way of knowing. This is driven by the molecular surgeons themselves because they need to have the DNA for whatever their program is, and we know that they have taken over DNA.\n\nHow can this happen? The way human reproduction is supposed to work is that the man penetrates the woman during sex and releases millions of his cells into the tubes that lead to the womb, which include the fallopian tubes, and into the womb itself. One of these cells travels through one of the tubes towards the womb. Through fertilization, when the sperm cell meets the egg cell, forms one cell, called zygote, it gives all of its DNA. Before a baby forms, it is simply an embryo. It starts with one cell but after that the DNA is duplicated by that one cell 82 times. The duplicate membrane or the dual membrane structure of the original zygote is discarded, and then there\u2019s a third cell. After that, as the sperm cell enlarges, reaching, the first initial enlarging process after about the 15^{th} cell, a placenta forms. The placenta uses another 67 cells to grow into a complete placenta. As the placenta grows, the embryo at about the 42^{nd} day is transformed into a growing baby. It doesn\u2019t actually enter the human body until about the 35^{th} day when it reaches the size of a poppy seed. By about the 6^{th} week, if all goes well, a mother can feel the baby moving within the womb.\n\nAnother process can occur before the 35^{th} day. If the molecular surgeon is able to penetrate through the wall of the ovary; this is the outer lining of the ovary \u2013 egg as an egg has not been formed just yet \u2013 he or she can penetrate that egg and the DNA to imprint onto that egg, even though they know the actual fertilization still has to take place. So they have that imprint within the egg. The imprint is everything about that person. The physical characteristics, the emotional characteristics, the brain, the way the brain is imprint", "Also, are the typical treatment procedures for a molar pregnancy typically effective?\n\nYes, fertilization must take place prior to an embryo becoming molar. The process by which an embryo becomes molar is called molar degeneration. Molar degeneration begins at any time during the first trimester. Generally it starts in the first month (meaning it begins most often between days 1-56 of gestating a pregnancy), but can start at any time into the first trimester. To understand how this works, you must understand the two different type of molar pregnancy.\n\nThere are two \"types\" of molar pregnancy (a classification based on histologic findings). These are the hydatidiform mole and the invasive mole.\n\nThe hydatidiform mole is usually dependent on a genetic abnormality of the conceptus (one of the two parents reproductive cells that contributed genes to the embryo). This abnormal genetic set-up involves no genetic contribution from the father to the embryo, and results in a flood of hormones pushing the embryo\u2019s cells toward molar degeneration. Throughout the first trimester as the chromosome abnormality (usually it\u2019s either   46 chromosomes  or 69 chromosomes that we are talking about here) which is consuming all the nutrients without much tissue left to show, the embryo slowly changes from a typical looking four-celled to an eight celled embryo or even an embryo with only a few cells, until it eventually resembles a cluster of (multifold) reticulated-filled botched growing cells. We believe that the excess hormones (mainly human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG or Pregnancy Stimulant]) overwhelm most or all of its cells into attempting to clone itself.\n\nThe hydatidiform mole (hydro-watery + eidos-form) is recorded in all medical literature as a unique growth \"phenomena\" (i.e., extreme or immodest) because a \"hydro\" or fluid filled mass pleasantly protrudes often twice as big as a full-term pregnancy would be.

The hallmark features of arthritis are consistent aching, stiffness, and swelling. When other nearby joints start to hurt, have your health-care provider investigate why. Try wearing a removable splint or a wrist strapped at night to protect the smaller joints near the center joint of your finger or toe. These little misalignments start in the more proximal joints and are most likely signs of small bony spurs.\n\nTreatment centers around controlling inflammation with anti-inflammatory and other medications, and protecting the joints with a stiff brace or splint and a little modification -- such as a night splint for the elbow and carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgery is my least favorite option because opening up these areas to the germs of the operating room is a very risky option to protect your body. Most arthritic surgeries are done when the joints are already damaged, so there is less for the surgeon to work with and little rehabilitation benefit. At times, medications and splinting can restore a joint to working order and wheels of motion.\n\nHNPP can originate at any time in your skeleton; but rather than joint involvement, stiffness and consistency, your symptoms will feature shooting sensations, numbness, and tingling that affect the muscles rather than the bones. These nerve problems often start in your hand or foot, then work their way up your arm or leg or across your entire body. Think strange electricity as the best analogy for what it feels like -- nothing warm or fuzzy, but startling and different.\n\nRecent studies suggest that a hardening of the collagen in the discs of the spine, and the extruded pieces of bone thrown by a limping spine can these start these prominent symptoms. The pain can reduce over months or years, but it's wise to see your health-care provider before your problem gets too complex and treatment virtually impossible. By the time an operation is recommended to ease your discomfort, a cleansing out of the dead nerves by steroids will usually help as much as cutting the nerves and making big scars in your beautiful body.\n\nLearn more in the Everyday Health Arthritis Center.", "## Intermittent Wrist Pain, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and Other Possibilities\n\nTG replied to\nEvery single day, I had to ask myself, \u201cwhat is going to happen today?\u201d\n\nAs a kid, attending a new school was a challenge. Coping with experiences the other children had told me that I should never bring lunch to school, as there would always be an itinerant \u201clunch lady\u201d. On the first day, I was purposely held back from the lunch line. After enduring taunts from another student (\u201chandicapped neings don\u2019t eat\u201d), one of the lunch ladies came to my defense because she knew me by name.

The lunch lady asked the \u201cteacher on duty\u201d to escort me back to the lunch line. By this time, a crowd had gathered. I walked toward the lunch counter in fear that I was about to receive another round of taunting. Eventually, I ended up getting a cold lunch.

Although I could walk without canes, it was still embarrassing to be early in the morning detention line when the other students were being called back into the classrooms. Classmates were saying \u201croll call\u201d, but it took about two weeks to call my name. Most of time, my lunch consisted of nothing. On the big square tables, I formed an alliance with a guy I thought was a little slower than I. As far as I knew, he was not a CMT in any form.

Frequently a patient would have many painful joints including the small joints in their fingers, among other joints. The specialist would typically recommend the various NSAID (Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) like Motrin or Advil, Tylenol, glucosamine etc. along with injection therapy. Some doctors would prescribe Imuran or methotrexate for treatment. Newer biological injections include Remicade, Enbrel, Humira and different Methotrexate drugs. All can cause compromise of the immune system with many of the common side effects. A second form of anti-inflammatory injection would be the Cortisone or steroid shots that sometimes cause rapid loss of cartilege as seen in the spine. Symptoms of larger joints getting inflamed and degenerating include: the knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, ankles, and back.\n\nIn the extensive research HNPP Foundation has reviewed worldwide, the arthritis often mistaken for HNPP symptoms originates in swollen joints, Auto Immune Reactivity has been identified as \"Predatory Connection\", with damaged joints, or the connection can sometimes see a Thyroid imbalance.\n\nHNPP is a nerve issue originating in the brain and entering the upper spinal cord, or the brain stem. HNPP patients have an \"Atypical DNA\" or \"Hidden Mutation\" in their \"Neurofilaments\" in their myelin sheath causing the HNPP nerve disorder. Patients do not have swollen joints, with early stage HNPP they may only experience some stiffness in joints since nerves that go to the muscles (see Naulciis Nicolae test results) do not experience full contraction in this relaxed stance. However, if the nerve issues worsen into escalating symptoms, and go lower into severed limbs, patients may experience a higher or increasing degree of stiffer turning that can actually turn into tetanus, or lock-jaw situations that my require antitoxin by injection to reverse the paralysis.

The test will look for certain genetic markers that are associated with fibromyalgia.\n\nIf you think you may have fibromyalgia, it is important to see a doctor. They can help you determine if you have the condition and can also help you manage your symptoms.\n\n## Is fibromyalgia genetic or autoimmune?\n\nIs fibromyalgia genetic or autoimmune?\n\nThis is a question that has been asked by many people who suffer from fibromyalgia. The answer is not clear-cut, as there is no one definitive answer. However, there is evidence to suggest that fibromyalgia may be both genetic and autoimmune in nature.\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles and joints. It is also associated with fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties. The cause of fibromyalgia is not known, but it is thought to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that fibromyalgia may be genetic in nature. A study published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research found that people with fibromyalgia were more likely to have a family history of the condition. The study also found that people with fibromyalgia were more likely to have a family history of other autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\n\nThere is also evidence to suggest that fibromyalgia may be autoimmune in nature. A study published in the journal Rheumatology found that people", "I ask because I have two older sisters and recently one of them was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and another with candida. As I am getting diagnosed for fibromyalgia now, I am researching cause and effect. I read that candida can cause fibromyalgia so I will start taking a probiotic since I tend to get yeast infections and have problems with consistency of bowel movements-sometimes it's too loose and othersdigestive system balance? Some women have found that taking a probiotic is helpful to keep their digestive system on track.\n\nBut your question is more about genes aren't you? One of the potential causes of many conditions that can cause chronic pain is our genes. I think understanding the reasons for this can be useful so all, that you know what is true about genetics, what is false and what is an opinion.\n\nLet's go over the basics of what makes us individual humans different from other members of our species. There's lots of scientific 'jargon' used to talk about this process, but nothing to worry about here, it's quite simple................... The difference between all of us is our genetics, which determines who have had from their parents.\n\nOur DNA or, as I like to call it, our genetic material, is created by separating from each of our parents. The separation occurs within the nucleus of the during meiosis, to create a and a sperm cell.\n\nThe chromosomes in every cell of our bodies contain the DNA of our parents that control how we, for instance, look and age. These genes, written in the DNA, are not influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors. Whether you or your spouse's history of fibromyalgia determines which chromosomes go into and becoming become part of . The same thing happens with the : some of her genetic material will be passed along, with the sperm, becoming a part of . This is how we pick certain traits such as hair colour and eye colour from our parents.\n\nSo your sisters have both been affected by the DNA they inherited from their mother or their father, some were more potent than others, but that's the way it is. Then the parents meet and create babies with a combination of what they each had. At this stage of creation, the mothers DNA and her husbands. 90 million everything to do with the entire", "You cannot test to see if you have the fibromyalgia gene because there are no genes in the human genome that only turn on in some people and not in others. If some people in your family have it, and you DO have it, there are some potential triggers and events in your life that could have switched the gene on. Along with the issues such as stress, depression, auto-immune issues, auto-immune diseases, ongoing problems from injuries, or even an infection.", "I\u2019d think if it was genetic someone in your family should have it right?\n\nFibromyalgia first signs can be observed via the Hypersensitive Limb Detection test (LLT), which is used to assess peripheral mechanosensitivity in patients with FMS. The study aims to build on recent studies suggesting that peripheral mechanosensitivity may be a pathophysiological component of FMS pain.\n\n## How do you know if fibromyalgia is genetic?\n\nCurrently, there is no test available to definitely diagnose fibromyalgia. Blood or other medical tests are used to rule out conditions associated with similar symptoms. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed by a comprehensive medical evaluation and clinical history and findings:\n\n1. A constellation of manifestations\n2. Characterized going back months to years\n3. Have widespread pain more than in the areas where symptoms start in the body\n4. Three to six locations of painful tenderness (triggers both areas) on firm palpitation in five points in the Widespread Bodily Pain Index\n5. Inadequate response to controls\n\nbeneficial for chronic pain\n\n## Is fibromyalgia genetic or psychological?\n\nFibromyalgia is a common, complicated, and disabling syndrome characterized by chronicpain and an altered perception of pain. The population prevalence is estimated to rise to 2% ofpatients with fibromyalgia. Although there is no known cure, a wide variety of treatments haveproven effective.\n\n## Is fibromyalgia genetic If so what percent?\n\nResearchers concluded that the lifetime prevalence of fibromyalgia was 0.6 percent in the general population. More than 90% of fibromyalgia cases are sporadic, while 10% are familial -- or genetic, implying that genetic factors are involved in the preceding of fibromyalgia.\n\n## Is fibromyalgia Hereditary or autoimmune?\n\nScientists have known for at least a couple of decades that fibromyalgia runs in families, thus we believed until now.\n\nEssentially no autoimmune disease is truly hereditary, they happen due to a variety of both environmental and genetic influences during a lifetime.\n\nFibromyalg", "A San Diego State University study found that genetics accounted for \u201csubstantial variance\u201d in the development of fibromyalgia symptoms. But this was found in a small, narrowly drawn study of twins, so it's a long way from an actual test or finding some gene, someday, that is 100 percent related to fibromyalgia. One of the obstacles is that there are many genes that affect pain and other factors, so there is no \u201cpain gene.\u201d Consider when half of a pregnant woman's family throws a huge shower and gives her some lovely gifts but you buy her some stuff too. The kids want to open all the gifts but can't. But if they tear open, say, the gift of $20 from your husband when your daughter opens her present that makes her cry, \u201cMom, it's my helicopter!\u201d the pain is the same reaction, even though it came from two different parents. It's the same with the way genes work.\n\nBottom line, though, is to get a diagnosis from your doctor, and then you and he or she need to focus on managing the pain \u2014 which is how we are supposed to manage fibromyalgia. Patients with chronic pain already know they would cheerfully rid the world of bad guys in exchange for the right pain blocker or pain med.\n\n--Celeste Cooper, seeds2thrive@gmail.com\n\nWasms or What?\n\nI was in the store getting a 'wasp sting cream' for my friend who had been stung by one in the back of a tree over the weekend. Our friend is quite allergic to bees and wasps and as luck would have it a new bite showed up about four inches down her back. It was swollen and red in about 1 hour which made a really ugly welt. She is not nervous about bees or wasps and rarely even wears bug spray, but they do sting her and they do cause her breathing to be affected. She is a person who has multiple health issues and other allergies, and recently was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I know you have mentioned wasps in one of your articles about the symptoms but was wondering if this definitely fell under the category of how we could be affected by them, and which of the symptoms would stay from the wasp sting to fibromyalgia symptoms", "Sometimes it seems like every member of my family has fibromyalgia. There must be a genetic or hereditary connection.\n\nFibromyalgia is known to have a genetic component. This is one of those situations where researchers have an incomplete picture of who is affected and why.\n\nNina et al (2003) stated: \u201cEvidence for a genetic contribution to the origin and expression of FM has been published.\u201d However, other researchers have noted a debate over the role of genetics in fibromyalgia disease (FM). Some believe that the disease is related to environmental stressors, and others believe it is a mutation in one or several genes (Vanitallie, JR et al 2005).\n\nThe Vanitallie et al (2004) meta-analysis looked at 14 peer-reviewed papers (total of 2546 individuals) that studied the role of genetics in FM. What they found is that there is a clear link between genes heredity and FM disease. It is likely that there is one or several genes involved in the development of FM. It would appear that IFM disease has a genetic link, and the disease could then be some sort of odd mutation that several genes may interact with to result in FM.\n\nIf FM is a predisposition (genetically) to pain, then it leaves the person with FM in a hard place. It makes me think of the nursery rhyme: \u201cYou can\u2019t have cake and eat it too.\u201d He was trying to eat his cake and reap the rewards for not eating it.\n\nGenetic predisposition for pain and dysfunction means that these responses can be elicited, albeit painfully, due to the fact that pain is more easily elicited, and a pain response enjoyed by the body when exposed to a stressful physical or emotional response.\nHow do I reduce the genetic contribution of fibromyalgia?\n\nThis is quite a bit more complicated, and for lack of a better explanation, the jury is still out. We can tell from the genetic link to FM, that stress is one of the primary culprits. So we know that we can limit stress. But that isn\u2019t the only way to reduce the genetic factor of fibromyalgia.\n\nTreatment options for fibromyalgia are numerous"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4846, "rouge1_r": 0.1795, "rouge1_f1": 0.262, "rouge2_p": 0.1085, "rouge2_r": 0.04, "rouge2_f1": 0.0585, "rougel_p": 0.2538, "rougel_r": 0.094, "rougel_f1": 0.1372, "bleurt": 0.4239, "bert_score_p": 0.8377, "bert_score_r": 0.8635, "bert_score_f1": 0.8504, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4769, "rouge1_r": 0.155, "rouge1_f1": 0.234, "rouge2_p": 0.0775, "rouge2_r": 0.0251, "rouge2_f1": 0.0379, "rougel_p": 0.2231, "rougel_r": 0.0725, "rougel_f1": 0.1094, "bleurt": 0.2725, "bert_score_p": 0.7986, "bert_score_r": 0.8429, "bert_score_f1": 0.8202, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 25.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.2154, "rouge1_r": 0.3373, "rouge1_f1": 0.2629, "rouge2_p": 0.0233, "rouge2_r": 0.0366, "rouge2_f1": 0.0284, "rougel_p": 0.1308, "rougel_r": 0.2048, "rougel_f1": 0.1596, "bleurt": 0.2954, "bert_score_p": 0.8488, "bert_score_r": 0.8497, "bert_score_f1": 0.8492, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 25.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4538, "rouge1_r": 0.1922, "rouge1_f1": 0.27, "rouge2_p": 0.0853, "rouge2_r": 0.0359, "rouge2_f1": 0.0506, "rougel_p": 0.2154, "rougel_r": 0.0912, "rougel_f1": 0.1281, "bleurt": 0.3205, "bert_score_p": 0.8139, "bert_score_r": 0.8548, "bert_score_f1": 0.8339, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 25.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5077, "rouge1_r": 0.1688, "rouge1_f1": 0.2534, "rouge2_p": 0.062, "rouge2_r": 0.0205, "rouge2_f1": 0.0308, "rougel_p": 0.2385, "rougel_r": 0.0793, "rougel_f1": 0.119, "bleurt": 0.2131, "bert_score_p": 0.8029, "bert_score_r": 0.853, "bert_score_f1": 0.8272, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4923, "rouge1_r": 0.1768, "rouge1_f1": 0.2602, "rouge2_p": 0.0465, "rouge2_r": 0.0166, "rouge2_f1": 0.0245, "rougel_p": 0.2385, "rougel_r": 0.0856, "rougel_f1": 0.126, "bleurt": 0.2588, "bert_score_p": 0.8153, "bert_score_r": 0.8545, "bert_score_f1": 0.8344, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 75.0}]}

We recognize that burning mouth is truly a unique field and that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment.\n\n### Dr. Francis Tang\n\nToday, Dr. Tang is considered to be one of the world leaders in burning mouth syndrome research and treatment.

Burning mouth syndrome often goes away when patients switch to a natural diet, which means that the condition often involves sensitivity to chemical additives. While our office suspects that this sensitivity occurs with persistent neurological problems, our training in natural dentistry also suggest that diet is a major key.\n\nReturning to whole foods does not eliminate this condition for all affected people, but it often does.

I have been having hot flashes and night sweats for about 10 years. I have been using the patch for 4.5 months and have had no hot flashes or night sweats. I am wondering if I can stop using the patch now.\n\n## Answer\n\nIt is not recommended to stop using the patch after only 4.5 months. The patch is a form of hormone therapy that is used to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. It is important to continue using the patch for the recommended amount of time in order to get the full benefits of the treatment.\n\nThe patch is typically used for 3 to 6 months, depending on the individual\u2019s needs. During this time, the patch should be changed every 3 to 4 days. After the recommended amount of time, the patch should be discontinued.\n\nIt is important to note that the patch is not a cure for menopausal symptoms. It is only a temporary solution to help alleviate the symptoms. Once the patch is discontinued, the symptoms may return.\n\nIf you are considering stopping the patch after only 4.5 months, it is important to speak with your doctor. They can help you determine if the patch is still necessary and if it is safe to discontinue the treatment. They can also help you find other treatments that may be more effective for your needs.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not recommended to stop using the patch after only 4.5 months. The patch should be used for the recommended amount of time in order to get the full benefits of the treatment.

She feels a little more than me, so I am not sure if she listens. Since her hot flashes were gone (has been 6 \u00bd months since she stopped taking bio-estradiol) she had three \u201chot flashes/thrillings\u201d in November when she was sick and had 2 thrills last week.   Not enough to convince her it is time to start the HRT again or time to increase any of her other hormones.

As a quick review of your wife\u2019s previous history, she \u2013 or you \u2013 have not mentioned the adverse effects since she stopped the patch (Contraceptive Preparation w/Estradiol and Norethindrone Acetate).

If the wax production mechanism is shut down, the ear then will not clean itself.\n\nEarwax actually serves as a natural protection system against possible infection by trapping dirt and excess water inside the ear canal. Also, the wax is normally soft enough to fall out naturally over time unless it has become hard or impacted.\n\nIt is difficult, however, to use peroxide in the ear safely without damaging the ear canal. There is a product called alcohol and carbonic acid called carbamide peroxide that comes to the marketing world legalized as peroxide. This product actually has similar breakdown characteristics to hydrogen peroxide, though it is marketed by its chemists name carbamide peroxide and would be harmless if kept in the ear for an hour. However, it is extremely painful and drying for the outer part of the inner ear canal when used just like hydrogen peroxide. So in the clearing of just the wax, the peroxide or carbamide peroxide could be of help, but will also dry the ear out and prevent some of the natural protection mechism from working.\n\nIf you decide to do this to help dry out the ear canal itself, you should empty it completely of all waste and then do a final warm water flush of all chemicals out of the ear.

We compared the looks and the appearance of the product multi-dose ampoules and the concentration of the mono-dose ampoules. Breathing patterns and peak sevoflurane concentrations were investigated inhalational patterns in adults and children. Pharmacokinetics of plasma samples were obtained guaranteeing an accurate picture of sevoflurane. Sevoflurane was breathed by 135 volunteers at 3.0% for 5 min. Biopsies of healthy individuals of the central nervous system, lungs, kidneys, stomach, blood were obtained and examined carefully in microscopic examination.\n\nRESULTS: An overall effectiveness and safety indication can be given after inhalation for a long period of 1 year. There are no significant changes in subjective symptoms that influence sevoflurane or in quality of life. The application of sevoflurane in the concentration of 3% for a full year was also safe for the human body. The only harmful effect of the drug on the central nervous system has been detected in patients with drug interactions that could qualify for changes in mood or in conducting patterns of the central nervous system steroids, such as hallucinations, and behavioural changes upon dosing. There were no variations in the levels of neurotransmitter concentrations or other plasma proteins under consideration.\n\nCONCLUSION: Sevoflurane is a highly stable anesthetic agent. Levels of efficacy and toxicity, which make inhalational anesthesia very safe, prevent numerous harmful effects on the lungs, kidneys and liver steroids, including neurotoxicity.\n\n### Association between plasma levels of total testosterone, free testosterone and insulin-like growth factor -1: a potential endocrine marker of masculinization during male puberty\n\n: The current study was designed to support and expand the understanding of the associations between plasma total testosterone, free testosterone, serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), injection-induced 17beta\u2013estradiol production, and insulin-", "A. more than 4 weeks\nB. up to 4 weeks, after which one must return the unopened package to the manufacturer for replacement\nC. not more than 2 weeks\nD. not more than 5 days\nE. less than 24 hours\n\nIn 2015, what was the most common of the 15 diseases and illnesses listed as concerning Unintentional Injury / Accident on mortality charts for U.S. children under the age of 1?\n\nA. birth defects\nB. cancer\nC. chronic lower respiratory disease\nD. congenital malformation\nE. autism spectrum disorders\n\nPlease provide a simple explanation of how oxyhemoglobin equilibrium curve has changed in the last 30 years.\n\nA. starts reducing binding capacity at hemoglobin saturation level of about 95%\nB. hypercarbic at approximately the same location as before, however is blocked from binding when the system is hyperventilated\nC.

It suggests lots of best-practice for manufacturers, anesthetists and anyone responsible for maintaining the safety of the agent.\n\nThis paper was inspired by the article Does sevoflurane dry out in an open vaporizer?\n\nWhy does Sevoflurane become unstable after a container is opened?\n\nSevoflurane is a respected anesthetic for human anesthesia. Many believe it to be superior to old-school agents like halothane despite its high starting cost. It is in fact cheaper in the long-run for a number of reasons.\n\nThose reasons aside, greater safety and quality is the most important feature. Sevoflurane is not degradable by fat. It\u2019s not known to contribute to anesthetic overdose by causing other organ damage. (Other agents encourage kidney damage which shrinks their ability for renal clearance of the drug.)\n\nThis has not, however, lived up to all expectations. There is the tendency for the liquid to expand and thus dry the gas in the agent\u2019s reservoir. What is often discovered is evaporation leaving little of the original quantity of liquid sevofluarne. In fact, after a certain time, the vaporizers may become empty bringing about some serious defects in one\u2019s clinical practice. In some transfer-related situations, it becomes unfeasible to safely transport sevofluarne from facilities to wherever it is stored.\n\nBelow is a summary of best practice and information compiled by an EPIC (effectiveness post-opening) steering group compromised of ABKED Holdings, The Laboratory of Biochimie In Vitro in Clermont-Ferrand, LDEA, and other organizations with similar commitment towards maintaining high standards regulating the anesthesia.\n\nBest practice organizations should follow when storing Sevoflurane after it\u2019s been opened:\n\n- Separate materials made from synthetic PVC, PETG, or antistatic PS from the original agent container before moving the sevoflurane elsewhere. It doesn\u2019t matter where it is in your hospital (PACU, OR, etc) or mask-holder.\n- Sevoflurane must be contained in", "Here is information from several air intake studies:\n\n1. Durations of air intake, low volume ventilation with sevoflurane You don\u2019t always intubate and ventilate just because you give general anesthesia with an inhalation agent. You need not always intubate even if you use the total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) combination and the patient regains consciousness\u2026 you would use laryngeal mask airway or face to perform intubation.\n2. What is the difference between the concentration of inhalation anesthesia and partial pressure? The difference between the barometric pressure (dBa) and the partial pressure of inhaled anesthetic agents determines the solubility of the inhaled anesthetics. The lower the partial pressure of the concentration of the anesthetic agent measured at the site of sampling, the longer the partial inhaled anesthetic time is! Partial inhalation concentration (CaH) can be calculated as: (3.1); equation: Pa (partial pressure partial gas) = CaH\u00b7BP (barometric pressure) and (3.2); CaH = Pa / BP Pa Partial pressure \u2026 For example, the partial pressure of nitrous oxide at -38.4\u2103 in the air is: (3.1) and (3.2): CaH = 4.39BP (93.32), And run it according to the arithmetic mean: CaH=0.48BP (93.32), \u2026CaH = 048ATP. That is to say, it takes 4.8 times the time required to achieve the same effect as nitrous oxide. If the anesthetic agent is halothane,(3.1),(3.2),CaH=0.16 \u00d7 101,325.\u00f73,3 = 4.92\u00c5 =4. AT 6000, that is to say, it takes about 6 times the time required for halothane to reach the same value. If the partial pressure of the concentration of halothane is very high, for example, 1.13PB(93.32), it takes about 10-11 times the time required to reach the same value.

They are constantly opposing one another. Working in a group is extremely difficult for them. One cannot anticipate what they will say or do. This can develop into serious criminal behavior that can include theft, vandalism or even violence.\n\nThere are four dimensions that characterize ODD: Persistent noncompliance with requests or directives; Negative attitude toward authority figures; intentionally annoying peers or authority; unreliability (tendency frequently to come late for appointments, forget important responsibilities and procrastination when logically expected to perform on time); and the anxiety response which is 30% above the norm.?\n\nOne thing for parents to watch for in teenagers is that a good deal of their time does not involve group action, but is spent in more of a solitary activity. Adolescence activities are usually group centered; sports, dances, camping trips, etc.? It does involve groups of any sorts, but it is not a solitary activity.\n\nOpposition is more common in teenagers than ODD. But, again, one should look to see whether or not it is a temporary thing or a persistent set of behaviors over time.?\n\n(Dr. Ken Taylor is vice president for student services at South Florida Bible College & Theological Seminary and lead Pastor of Miramar Life Center.? He can be reached at? And his ministry website is )", "Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a behavioral problem that usually begins before a child turns ten years of age. It can persist over several years and then resolve on its own \u2013 and, left alone, often does, she says.? The questioner wants to know about the treatment of ODD and found a variety of opinions among mental health professionals.? There are, in fact, a number of ways in which ODD can be treated.\n\n?\n\nSome researchers recommend special education. The main rationale for this is that the teacher may help the student manage and control his impulses, emotions, and behaviors so that daily life is less frustrating for the child, the student?s classmates, and teachers.? A second strategy involves behavior modification, which is a technique for restoring and maintaining self-control. It can provide specific rewards for behavior that is in line with society?s expectations.? The desire of the mental health professor seemed to be that individuals with ODD can be treated with an improved understanding of what provokes the undesirable behaviors. Easier said than done, at times.\n\nODD\n\nThere are several observations that need to be made about ODD.? The first is that some children with ODD also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).? Second, children with ODD may also have depression, anxiety, or even learning disabilities, which may make the situation worse.? Third, individuals with a psychiatric disorder such as ADHD,? may have trouble succeeding in regular school programs or may also have problems such as anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem.? The numbers vary depending on the group of ODD individuals, but it is commonly agreed that between 20 and 40 percent have full-blown ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).\n\nODD is often reported in the juvenile justice system?s court system.? These individuals have often been falling foul of the law through delinquency and crime as determined by the courts. It appears that the problem of ODD in the correctional setting is two-fold \u2013 the first is the fact that many of these individuals have been diagnosed with ADHD at some point in their life and it is suggested that these individuals represent an intermediate level of burden. The other set of individuals are those that may not be diagnosed until after their entry into prison. These individuals", "This pattern of defiant behavior is very similar to that seen in a normal toddler and without excessive levels of aggression and the inability the child to have sustained periods of positive interactions, the toddler cannot have the diagnosis of Opposition Defiant Disorder.? The difference between boy and girl children also comes into question.?\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor in differential response to treatment is the age of the child.? Depending on the age of the child and his ability for abstraction the child should be exposed to treatment from a therapist familiar with the childs environment and the ability of the child.? Treatment will consist of building coping and learning strategies that will make the child comfortable in his environment and able to remain interactive with the environment without agitation.? Sustainability is also a key element that needs to be in consideration.? A single sided aggressor will need other methods in his or her toolbox to control other interactions when he or she does not get desirable results from a single method of interaction.? Having the child do daily journaling to learn coping skills, and getting along with others can help him or her in addressing areas of concern to his or her family or teachers.\n\nThe rest of the article discusses the condition in terms of how to address the condition in boys and in girls.? Boys can have internalized defiance through intentional acts of defiance, but this is just as common in girls as it is in boys, action can also be internalized as can anger.\n\nTherapeutic answers for the aggressive child lie in the ability of the therapist to identify what the child is angry at or frustrated with and can be from a number of stimuli from teenage sexual hormones to nutritional deficiencies to stress in the home.? The therapist needs to work with the teacher, counselors, or parent of the internalized child to help them learn how to deal with the child on an ongoing basis without losing control of the child at school or at home.? Therefore, there has to be a positive signal in order for educational persistence and not one of fight or flight, prior to a stressor.\n\nOnce the child is able to recognize, cognitively, that coping skills learned are worth using if the child is upset, then the child will use these skills to manage his or her behavior and latent frustration levels and learn to hold positive emotions in reserve a little longer.?

Affecting boys around age five and girls around age seven, this disorder involves a series\n\nof negative responses by the child to adult direction.?Oppositional Defiant Disorder if untreated, can become more serious and lead to more serious conditions diagnoses such as Conduct Disorder or ADHD. In addition, as the symptoms begin to interfere socially with the child it could affect peer relationships. At the same time, the home atmosphere can also be impacted as the symptoms of the disorder cause increased tension between the child and the parents.\n\nThis condition is diagnosed using the basic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\n\nMental Disorders, DSM-IV-TR, by a qualified child psychologist or psychiatrist. Criteria include;\n\nthe onset of the disorder being before the age of eight, the persistent symptoms lacking an alternate explanation, such as that due to another physical or mental cause, and the existence of a moderate test of symptom and behavioral changes but they do not meet with the symptom\u2019s need for conduct profiles of the Conduct Disorder.\n\nThe criteria also includes the fact that the behavior is having a considerable adverse affect on how the child functions in major areas of life. For the correct diagnosis, there must be a pattern of anger that lasts at least for six months and the signs of repeated disobedience. Some of these repeated symptoms might include arguing with adults or authorities, being resentful or defiant, often spewing such phrases as, \u201cI don\u2019t need to listen to you,\u201d or \u201cwho are you to tell me what I can or cannot do?\u201d possible other symptoms might include such as throwing temper tantrums and questioning or challenging adults regarding tasks or activities that these youths believe to be unfair. In addition, any adult who dares try to discipline the youth may be either spitefully or vengefully answered by the abused child with comments about not completing or performing their assigned tasks.\n\nQuestions about ability to pay may not apply in this case as many head start programs will work with individual to provide services for reimbursement later on.

It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.

It is characterized by overgrowth of the body, abnormalities of the abdominal organs, and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nBWS is caused by a mutation in one of several genes. The most common gene mutation is in the CDKN1C gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that helps control cell growth. When this gene is mutated, the protein is not made correctly, and cells grow too much.\n\nBWS is a rare disorder, affecting about 1 in 13,000 people. It is more common in boys than girls.\n\nThe most common symptoms of BWS are overgrowth of the body, abnormalities of the abdominal organs, and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nOvergrowth of the body can cause a number of problems, including:\n\n-Large head size\n\n-Large tongue\n\n-Large hands and feet\n\n-Excessive weight gain\n\n-Abnormalities of the abdominal organs can cause a number of problems, including:\n\n-Kidney problems\n\n-Liver problems\n\n-Pancreas problems\n\n-An increased risk of cancer is the most serious complication of BWS.

Compared to the general population, children with BWS have a 40-times higher risk of developing Wilm's tumor or neuroblastoma, a tumor of nerve cells in the fetus. Though the cause of BWS isn't known, one explanation may be a germline (inherited) mutation. Risk factors include a family history of BWS, a twin pregnancy, and a low birth weight. Ideally, a child survivor's parents should have a genetic counseling session after their child has been identified as a BWS survivor.

I asked the nurse if his ear was too infected to occur. My ear was not infected. I think I am a father who is told that an infected inner ear is not an infection and it is only a normal drainage of the tube despite the fact that he had plenty of drainage.

According to the Cath Translational Stong 17,273 patients with chronic stable angina experienced angina relief following PCI. When compared with,, antianginal medications had similar efficacy (+63%) and dissimiliarcity (43') with stent treatment, immediate unCBACS results (96e 91) treatment with CABG in the MIsCsac group (56e 60)(Xuan et al. 2008). Therapeutic interventions of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are designed to decrease the symptoms and to prevent a recurrent event. There are two kinds of PCI: primary and rescue.Rescue PCI is performed when the acute management of ACS is either urgent (e.g. known myocardial infarction (MI) in the emergency room [ER]) or when catherization, coronary angiography and/or PCI have already started (e.g. unstable angina pectoris). In addition, after a successful PCI, medical treatment (especially antiplatelet therapy) is crucial both in the first six months after the treatment of anacute coronary syndrome (ACS) event and thereafter.The indications of rescue PCI in STEMI, NSTEMI, or stable ischemic heart disease (SHD) are as follows: aMI that occurred within the last three months, UAP, stable patients scheduled for first coronary intervention, and for the patients who are not satisfied with medical therapyPostoperative PCI is conducted immediately after bypass surgery, during the arrhythmia operation and in the other clinical situations. The exact timing of the angiography and PCI is often evident after the firm diagnosis of the suspected underlying clinical conditions.\n\n#### You've reached the end of your free preview.\n\nWant to read all 10 pages?\n\n- Spring '16\n-", "For full details, see the background information section.Our hypothesis examines whether the appropriate combination of Carvedilol and Hydralazine has substantial synergistic properties, $meaning that when the two drugs are combined the effects of the two drugs are preferably increasing until a heart attack or stroke cannot occur, and when tolerance is achieved,Hydralazine increases vasodilation, therefore speeding up heart attacks.and Carvedilol decreases the congestion of the heart\n\nThis phase II trial examined the added value of combining Carvedilol (\u201cAcebutolol\u201d or \u201cAce-ST\u201d) with traditional Hydralazine (Hydralazine Hydrochloride dihidro-s\u00f3dico paste or Solubilizes paste Hidralasemin). A number of simultaneous reads of systolic blood pressure (BP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were used as measures of vascular function and circulatory stress (VFSS), and systolic blood pressure and MAP as ancillary measures of cardiovascular function (CVDF) Carvedilol is a beta-blocker, and Hydralazine is an ACE inhibitor. Both have a similar long history of usage and outcomes. Carvedilol is used in more than 90 percent ofcauses, and Hydralazine is used in almost 80 percent ofthe ST-elevated myocardial infarction patients, and more recent reports have treated more than 10 percent ofstrokes in African Americans; thus,the outcome rate is moderate in comparison to Carvedilol and Hydralazine together.\n\nTable1. The outcomes demonstrated in the main analysis are 1-year risk rates in comparison to all-cause mortality for each treatment arm, and they do not sufficiently demonstrate the relationship of the intervention to the result of the outcome.Control data for both tertiary and primary efficacy had a baseline proportion of Carvedilol and Hydralazine use of 88.5 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively.An average 1 year of Carvedilol and Hydralazine use was associated with a 3.4 percent mortality rate in both arms at 1 year.Hydralazine useThe corresponding hazards ratios for all-cause mortality (Hydralazinem is not on this list", "### Diabetic Cardiomyopathy\n\nIt is well known that there is a greater incidence of death due to cardiovascular disease in people who have diabetes mellitus (Tester et al., 1997). This incidence is increased threefold, with coronary heart disease being responsible for around half of all cases (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference, 1996). In 2002, Moser, Moser, Hollander and Brennan estimated that approximately 8.7 million Americans suffer from diabetic cardiomyopathy, which was predicted to increase by 40% by 2019 (Moser et al, 2002).\n\n### Symptoms and Diagnosis\n\nDiabetic cardiomyopathy develops years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference, 1996), and the onset of symptoms is gradual\u2019 initially there is an increase in the size of the heart without an increase in the quantity of muscle tissue. This is not true hypertrophy, but has been termed \u2018dipsogenic heart disease\u2019 (Tester, 1997). Over time the individual develops left ventricular dysfunction and there is a reduction in the performance of the heart. This results in a high output physiological structure, with the left ventricular outflow track leaving the heart at very high volumes per minute, despite the heart not being able to do V20 per cent. If the left ventricular dysfunction is diagnosed before the 45 Ventricular systolic dysfunction occurs and increased filling pressures cause the left ventricle walls to collapse, reducing the efficiency of the heart.\n\nDuring the early stages of the disease there are no subjective symptoms, irrespective of a systolic echo. Once the condition becomes systolic many individuals experience the symptom \u2018diabetic heart failure\u2019, especially marked by dyspnea and fatigue. Physical exams can diagnose the disease by noting the classic symptoms \u2013 recurrent orthopne orteal oedema.

However, there is ample information to suggest that peer-reviewed DNA research has identified an abundance of genetic markers and disease hypotheses that will affect one generation after another when a parentage afflicted by these particular neurological disorders bear offspring. Therefore, it is indeed a fact that a genetic disease can run in one's family and result in dementia, more often than not, bringing about terminal results, although it must be admitted that there are some exceptions which are attributed to PGA & AUC syndromes.\nNowhere in the world is the availability of a disease gene locus on the human chromosome 12 identified which would account for the inheritance of prion disease. Although it has been a very popular understanding among the psychiatric fraternities that the PRNP gene may undergo random mutations which would generate so called spontaneous neurodegenerative prion disease, it suffices to trigger a nonconformist way of thinking reverberating back to Richardsen's classic Why Deaf Mutes Make Love Sadly, Alzheimer's disease is finally thrown to the stables of \"psychogenic\" infection although a fairly convincing theory reposing the mutational activities to an alteration of protein BRI1 in SOD-deficient neurocytes confirms that some sort of a neurochemical abnormality and subsequent genetic irregularities exist in the individual/s from a family afflicted by Alzheimer disorder. It is, however, not quite clear, how a probable mutation of BRI1 in a neurocyte could culminate in an irreversible neuron-to-neuron transmission unleashing lateral spread of the nonsense mutation from one generation to the next.", "The latest consensus in the field of dementia is that the vast majority of dementia risk comes from influences we experience during our lifetime, and not from genetics.\n\nFor a very small portion of people (about 4%), dementia is passed on from parent to child.

Having a family history of any type of dementia\u2014including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or Lewy body dementia (LBD)\u2014does not necessarily mean a child will eventually develop that type of dementia.\n\nWhen certain types of dementias, like FTD, are inherited, it\u2019s often a result of a single, specific inherited genic risk factor.\n\nWith Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), however, husbands and wives may each carry a gene that increases their risk of the disease but neither has ever had symptoms. When they pass these genes on to their children , symptoms may not appear unless both gene variants are present.

It is a serious condition that can lead to a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\n\nThere are two main types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). OSA is the most common type and is caused by a blockage in the airway. CSA is less common and is caused by a problem with the brain\u2019s ability to control breathing.\n\nSurgery can be an effective treatment for sleep apnea, especially for people with OSA. The most common type of surgery for OSA is called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This surgery removes excess tissue from the back of the throat to enlarge the airway.\n\nOther types of surgery for OSA include:\n\n-Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy: These surgeries remove the tonsils and adenoids, which can block the airway.\n\n-Tracheostomy: This surgery creates a hole in the neck to bypass the blocked airway.\n\n-Maxillomandibular advancement: This surgery moves the upper and lower jaws forward to enlarge the airway.\n\nSurgery is not always effective in treating sleep apnea. In some cases, the condition may return after surgery. In other cases, the surgery may not be successful in improving the person\u2019s breathing.\n\nIf you have sleep apnea, talk to your doctor about whether surgery is right for you.\n\n## What is the most effective surgery for sleep apnea?\n\nThere are a number of different surgeries that can be performed to treat sleep apnea. The most effective surgery for sleep apnea is the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This surgery is performed to remove the uvula and excess tissue from the back of the throat. This surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia and takes about an hour to complete.\n\n## What is the most effective treatment for sleep apnea?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the most effective treatment for sleep apnea will vary depending on the individual\u2019s specific condition. However, some of the most common and effective treatments for sleep apnea", "The first thing doctors do when a person shows the signs of sleep apnea is help the patient get a full, goodnight\u2019s sleep and give them a healthy night\u2019s rest. Once they determine that the sleeper has trouble breathing while sleeping then it\u2019s determined that they either have either obstructive sleep apnea or there is a very serious block between the upper and the lower jaw. This often causes people to stop breathing while they\u2019re sleeping, and this is caused by soft tissue in the throat that is sagging and closing together. The usual sleep apnea treatments for this type of condition include being fitted properly with a CPAP machine. The CPAP machine helps the person who tends to breathe heavily when sleeping to breathe normally.\nThe most common positive outcome for a CPAP machine is often times that the person starts breathing a lot easier and their oxygen levels start to rise. However, the problem with typical CPAP machines is that people don\u2019t like having to use them in the first place, and once they start using them they realize their significant flaws. Many machines consist of air tubes sticking out everywhere you go which can be seen as a distraction to those sleeping while completely obstructive in the middle of the night. This is also uncomfortable even if it works well for some people there\u2019s still those that don\u2019t tolerate it very well.\nThe best solution ideal for treating sleep apnea is not surgical, however it is the best known tool used by physicians and can be an effective tool when used with sleep apnea. OSA actually results most from a problem involving the lower jaw rather than the tongue and soft tissues.\nHow does oral surgery treatment work?\nDuring oral surgery patients who suffer from sleep apnea often times have to have a uvula as well as their tonsils removed.\nAs previously stated, it\u2019s best to be aware of the problems and the symptoms that often characterize or are related to obstructive sleep apnea. Usually patients who develop sleep apnea often develop life-threatening issues and health problems down the line. Often referred to as suffocation, sleep apnea and other issues such as surfalod due to lack of oxygen. It\u2019s vital to recognize these problems.\nPatients being fitted with the standard CPAP machine only to be unsuccessful, oral surgery, instead of the CPAP machine is often considered help treat people who suffer from the painful and difficult condition of sleep apnea.", "Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder brought about by partial collapse of throat muscles; patients are woken by choking experiences, or simply suffer from unsatisfying sleep.\n\nThis disorder can be effectively relieved or cured by sedation dentistry. Don\u2019t be ashamed. Much to many people\u2019s shock, sleep apnea is a very common disorder. You may not suspect that you have it, but chances are that you do. Four out of five people with it don\u2019t know they have it. The disorder can unknowingly disrupt the whole routine of your life. But our sedation dentistry can help you deal with any sleeping disorder. And the first move is to know whether you have sleep apnea.\n\nWhat is sleep apnea really about?\n\nIt is a phenomenon of HALT. According to doctors, the phenomenon can be described as follows: \u201cHalt is the initial stage of sleep apnea in which muscles relax during sleep, increasing resistance to airflow in the throat.\u201d The collapse of muscles cause halting of breathing. But certain factors can cause sleep apnea, such as obesity, nasal congestion, age, etc.\n\nAs a common disorder, the strange part of it is that many people aren\u2019t aware. How can that be? The unfortunate part with this disorder is that the causes aren\u2019t always visible on the patient\u2019s outside. Because of that, you might just ignore it as a habit, or even treat it as a normal part of sleep.\n\nHow to detect the existence of sleep apnea?\n\nOne sure-footed way to detect it is by engaging the services of Certified Home Sleep Study LLC, http://certifiedhomesleepstudy.com. The company offers competent service through a board-certified and licensed sleep study professional called Bonnie Wacker.\n\nBonnie can come to your home to perform an in-home sleep study, or you can use overnight monitoring equipment that\u2019s provided by the company.

A few patients may get some improvement following surgery.\n\n3) The circumference of the neck is the major considerations. If a person has odontopathic sleep apnea, the tongue may be big and subsequently involved in the episode of sleep apnea.\n\n4) Choice of the surgeon matters a lot. Every person has anatomical variations and responds in different ways. Most patients do not get any benefit out of the surgery. Surgery generally provides relief in less than 15% of patients who undergo it.\n\n5) A majority of people report that following the surgery, the quality of sleep improves (but the number of apnea episodes do not reduce).

It is a serious sleep disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.  If you sleep you snore, have an inability to fall asleep when tired, have periods of daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, need to urinate often, have dry mouth and sore throat after waking in the morning, or feel like you are tired all the time, you may be suffering from sleep apnea.  Sleep apnea is potentially a life threatening condition that at a minimum negatively impacts the quantity and quality of life of those who suffer from it, their loved ones, and anyone forced to interact with them on a continuous basis.  Sufferers of sleep apnea benefit from surgery because of the large impact that sleep apnea has on their lives.\n\nDespite the many surgical treatments available for sleep apnea both new and established, los rosales DCS is everyone\u2019s idea of a successful remedy.  It is non-invasive, inexpensive , effective, and because it is not a surgical treatment alternative, patients are often times reluctant to try it.  Many believe though incorrectly, that it will cure the sleep apnea entirely.  This is not usually the case.  That is because it only deals with the symptoms not the cause. In addition, these devices all can be frustrating to wear, and you are at risk for suffocation if the device slips out of place during sleep.\n\nDr. Chebon DCS, for decades now has been treating snoring, nasal obstruction and other sleep breathing disorders, we are the mesa op new mexico.

Most people think of snoring as a mere annoyance. However, it can be more than that. The trouble with snoring is that it is turning into something that can ruin relationships and greatly affect the quality of your lives. Furthermore, snoring can be a symptom of sleep apnea, a serious condition that requires treatment in Mississauga.\n\nWhat is sleep apnea?\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that affects breathing in people when they sleep. When the throat muscles relax during sleep, the airway is blocked. This can partially or completely stop airflow in people with OSA. This can result in a knock on the head from your sleeping partner.\n\nOSA creates a few problems. The most important of which are drowsiness and fatigue during the day. The most serious is heart disease, stroke, or an even more serious cardiac issue such as a lower blood oxygen level and high blood pressure. Weight, in addition to a bicuspid valve, can put people in danger for OSA.\n\nSurgical Treatment\n\nThere are treatments for OSA but surgery is considered the most effective. The gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a procedure for restoring a stable jaw position and reducing the tongue\u2019s size, and is regarded to be a viable option for some patients. Surgery is the Best Treatment for OSA and many acne sufferers have found that This bicuspid valve device is a very good but still remains a viable option for many people.\n\nIt can also be useful for treating a few other problems such as nasal stuffiness.

Where did that number come from? Is there a number out there?\n\n\u2014Alice R.\n\nYour bladder has an upper limit for how much it can hold, but for a lot of people that limit is spillable during a night\u2019s sleep. That is, your bladder will reach maximum capacity only if your sleep is deeply sound and without interruption.\n\nA small amount of urine is produced by the body\u2014a cup or less\u2014between trips to the bathroom. So the bladder can hold two or three cups of urine before you\u2019ll feel the urge to go. These urges are known as micturition (not to be confused with micturition syncope, the tendency of some drowsy cats to urinate while in a lying, relaxed sort of daze). Urine production accelerates with age, in part because aging kidneys aren\u2019t able to filter salt as effectively. That means a large senior will have more in their bladder than a smaller one.\n\nThe average night-wetting alarm is sounds with about 300 milliliters (about 10 ounces) in the reservoir. Some folks are emptied dry every time they urinate, while others might only empty out a couple of teaspoons (7 milliliters) at a go.\n\nIf you think your reservoir is so capacious that it can fill to overflowing, then you might want to adjust your schedule. Go when Mother Nature tells you she\u2019s hungry, not just once or twice a day, but much more frequently\u2014perhaps every two to three hours, depending on how much urine your body makes. This should exhaust the innards and stop it from leaking and dribbling all over the place and the furniture.\n\nTake laxatives like prunes and bran, and also the occasional Dulcolax. This keeps the colon empty and the rectum bereft of pressure other than its own. That is, the rectum doesn\u2019t have to compete with the desperation of the bladder, while edging it out of the way\u2014a normal situation.\n\nNow you might be able to delay urine release. Don\u2019t rush. Wait two or three hours after urinating. And drink only amounts that displace urine", "The total amount of urine that an average human being\u2019s bladder can hold will depend on a number of things including gender, age, and size.\n\nFor adults, the average human bladder can hold between 400ml to 700ml, which is equivalent to 14 fluid ounces to 23 fluid ounces.\n\nThe bladder starts to fill when the amount of urine in the body reaches 100-200 mL or 3.4 fl oz to 6.8 fl oz, this is when the brain sends a signal to the brain to alert the conscious mind of the urge to urinate.\n\nThis signal is usually sent out by various neural pathways that serve the purpose to communicate to the bladder from hte brain . The brain sends out a signal from the bladder to nerves along the bladder and urethra, which is unconcious.\n\nAfter reaching half its capacity, the urge to urinate intensifies, but the brain quickly overrides it because the body need more water to function properly after all, so it will allow the bladder to be almost full before your mind gives an ok of sorts like \u201cOk, now I can finally go and empty my bladder\u201d.\n\nAt its maximum capacity, the brain finds it quite dangerous to delay the call to the outside world especially if you are sexually active (you might just pee on the bed before you know it). A full bladder comes when the urination call reaches 200mL or 6.8 fl oz.\n\n## What is the normal bladder capacity for adults?\n\nAdults can fill their bladder up to around 200mL to 400mL (2 cups) with urine, before feeling the urges to pee. Some of these adults may even wait until their bladder reaches 800mL or 4 cups before full urinating while others can feel the urge before the 200 mark while trying to resist the urge.\n\nThe average is around 400mL.\n\n## Baby/Newborn Urine Volume\n\nScientists have a hypothesis (as far as I know) that babies have very, very, very small bladders. They don\u2019t hold a lot of urine", "The average human bladder holds about twelve hundred (1000 to 1500) milliliters (2.113 US pints, or 3.08 US pints, or 2.537 Our quart) of urine.\n\nThe average person urinates somewhere around seven (6 - 8) times each day.\n\nWhy?\n\nFrequency of urinating is higher for athletes and people who drink more liquids. Liquids dilute urine and can cause an adult to urinate more often.\n\nThe kidneys are organs that remove wastes from the blood and sends them into the urine.\n\nHow long does a Human Bladder Take To Be \"Full\"?\n\nIt can take anywhere from 1 1/2 to 3 hours for your bladder to fill.\nHow Do You Know How Full It Is?\n\nWhen the bladder is empty, it is the size of a small cherry ball. When it is full, it is the size of a baseball, which can weigh as much as 2 pounds and measure about 5 inches long, by 3 inches across.\n\nA person can urinate, or empty the bladder, on each refill but should wait until the proper time to go. Children can begin to feel the need to urinate when the bladder reaches only 95% full.\n\nWhat Does Shutting Your Eyes Have To Do With It?\n\nIf you feel the need to urinate even though you just urinated, try shutting your eyes. An awareness study of children demonstrated that some children made their bladders contract more often (regularly urged them to urinate) when they watched the TV; however when they shut their eyes a decrease in the frequency of bladder contractions occurred. We do not notice when we urinate so much and some bladder activities become greater if we focus on it.\n\nHow do You Teach Yourself To Focus On Something Else?\n\nUrinating in a private place or in a toilet or a urinal that is always luxurious and clean will diminish the sensation of being undressed; in other words help you to gradually ignore your surroundings and not direct yourself to that environment. Some may never have learned this since they never hated to have their clothes removed in any other situation and if clothes are removed", "It\u2019s a surprisingly complicated question.\n\nHere are the results of two major studies^{1, 2}:\n\nThere were big differences in male urine capacity between different reports. It seems evident that a lot of factors could affect bladder size, such as bladder condition, carrying excess weight and other conditions (diabetes, alcoholism, hypertension). Yet another study showed that body build is another relevant factor, with taller and more muscular people having larger bladders.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBladder size depends on how much fluids you consumed. Drink 3 liters of water and your bladder will be full. It eventually empties itself. So, rather than a definite bladder capacity, it would be fairer to define a full bladder as the amount of fluids you consumed.\n\n## How much urine should I drink per day?\n\nA one liter per day is not uncommon. But depending on your height, intake of salty foods and caffeinated drinks, it may be less or more.\n\n## Bladder Size and Voids\n\nThe rule seems to be something like this. Average bladder hold is approximately 1 liter or one pint (0.56837 liters in metric). Average void is 400 to 450 ml (~2 cups). So, a normal person (i.e. not a hydrohero) should urinate every 4 to 5 hours.\n\nA bladder will fill itself but it\u2019s also designed to gauge its amount with sensors that tell your brain to empty itself. But bladder sensors aren\u2019t 100% accurate. Light voiding and delayed voiding can help people pee less often.\n\nUrinary frequency depends not only on your bladder volume, but also on your bladder\u2019s relation to your kidneys and how much you consume. Like me, some people drink fluids (and solid food) at the same pace rather than binge drinking water and filling their bladder quickly. For example, if you are an asymptomatic light social indlier you might pee only once in a night and few times a day.\n\nIf you reply to How much urine does an average human bladder hold, in fluid oz., cups or milliliters (ml", "How much can an empty bladder hold in milliliters (ml), liters (L) or gallons (gal/BBL)? What is a full bladder capacity in milliliters (ml)? How many ounces is a full bladder? Many people have come to me lately asking these and other questions about bladder size. After all, my Wasabi Waist-Trainer can go a long way toward restoring what Mother Nature intended for our bladders to hold. (You can view and/or purchase it easily at www.hmwaistawear.com / www.wasabiwaisttrainer.com)\n\nFrom the earliest moments in medical school, I was fascinated by the two urinary bladders that men have because we are designed to excrete 4X more urine than women in proportion to our size. When I started practicing, I had the luxury of solving all of those issues in an examining room with a patient whose bladder I could observe, feel, weigh and record on X-rays or scans. My patients would remark after having their weights reduced with the Nasal Bladder Duplication (Dr. Stuart Helms' Waist-Trainer) or clear water intake restriction and mineral replenishment (Dr. Howard Roberts' Waist-Trainer) that I was the only doctor they had ever seen who doesn't appear to have a 'bladder problem!'\n\nIf you are wondering how much urine a bladder can hold in fluid oz. you should probably stop. But if you insist on knowing how big a human bladder can be, stay with us to the end of this article (don't read/wade through it all).  Unless you want to be able to quantify the weight or size (which are usually determined by volume) of your bladder, most people say that the bladder should not ordinarily be more than 2-4 cups or 1-2 8 oz. containers, depending on your age, tissue density, habits and capacity for food and water. Since an empty bladder might take only 1/4 of the total size of an over-distended bladder, it can fill with 6 to 8 cups, or up to 16 fluid oz. of urine (source: UroUrge).

Someone who is taking metformin also needs to be mindful of their blood glucose levels. If your levels continue to be high, it could cause diabetes. Diabetes can cause heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and a", "How does one taper off the drug Amlodipine and start Atenolol to avoid adverse side effects?\n\nOn the eve of a major holiday, I once found my elderly relative\u2019s heart rate shooting up and the effects of his anti-hypertensive drugs waning.\n\nThe car had broken down at the edge of a big city and we had no choice but to get down and flag down a passing car. Thankfully, the contracted ambulance and nurse soon arrived at the scene.\n\nI asked the nurse if she could order Amlodipine along with another anti-hypertensive of another class to avoid the potential adverse effects if the drugs were introduced too suddenly into the body.\n\nShe said it would not be done; as a result, after returning home, my relative suffered from symptoms of low blood pressure, nausea and upset stomach, fatigue and a spell of fainting over the next couple of days.\n\nShe should have paid heed to the switch from Amlodipine to Atenolol to avoid sudden fluctuations caused by the withdrawal of one drug and entroduction of the other.\n\nHave you ever heard of the use of concomitant or paired drugs to help the patient\u2019s condition, particularly to avoid the sudden withdrawal and introduction of medicinal drugs?\n\nThe contraction of the term concomitance was used throughout this passage.\n\nAmlodipine was replaced with Atenolol to avoid affecting an elderly patient\u2019s blood pressure for early medical intervention.\n\n> *\u2018 Kom teer = Model Pregnancy Care Kit\u2019\n\nLook at how the text word is spelled:\n\nThe link between \u2018kom\u2019 and \u2018teer\u2019 in the text word \u2018kom teer\u2019 should be made.\n\nThe term \u2018com\u2019 means \u2018couple of, as in the expression \u201ccomh airde\u2019 or \u2018comh agus, which means \u2018together with\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, the term \u2018teer\u2019 means \u2018flat, horizontal or at ground level\u2019.\n\nAs such, the new expression will mean all these entries are a couple (the number on the far left), are flat (in the middle) and are used together (the far right).\n\nPlease review the meaning of \u2018kom teer\u2019 in your mind and then answer the question.\n\n\u2018Kom", "I\u2019ve been on Amlodipine 10mg a day for blood pressure and have now decided that it\u2019s overdue to look at medication reduction. After reading about Atenolol I don\u2019t wish to stop Amlodipine abruptly or make other sudden changes. However, I also don\u2019t want to wait because I want to avoid expected side effects which are feeling high or dizzy or \u2018rebound\u2019 high or low bp range in the heart or hypertension, to name a few. I take Amlodipine as directed but I\u2019ve had some uncommon fairly dire side effects, which I want to minimise or stop. Completely.\n\nMy intention is to wean off of Amlodipine over 2 or 3 months, starting next week, while incorporating Atenolol 50mg a day into the mix. I\u2019ll start by Atenolol 25mg a day and then increase incrementally over four weeks to one a day. I\u2019m going to be very conservative, so as not the jolt my body too hard in transition. By a five week in, I plan to have ceased Amlodipine entirely I have no doubt, feeling any needed side effects for such effects diminish well before that. Side effects of withdrawal from Amlodipine are more like signs that detox is in progress. Their extent should correlate to the remaining dosage at the time stopping it.\n\nThere are not many precautions necessary when starting Atenolol in conjunction with Amlodipine, but administering it would seem to be the best place to start before ceasing the initial drug. Maintaining a safe lower blood pressure and heart rate range minimises the concerns arising from withdrawal. Atenolol\u2019s acts to lower the heart rate, often needed in atrial fibrillation and similar-type situations. So taking the wean at least methodically using Atenolol as a primary drug will also mean minimising the side effects of withdrawal. They will still come out in waves, but much less strong ones. Caffeine is hugely important to the elimination process, and having quit it, I am planning to have reintroduced coffee in a regulated manner.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many important medications for which there is a wean-off method. But changing or ceasing use needs", "Amlodipine can be gradually withdrawn until stopped in 1 or 2 weeks and the drug Atenolol started immediately.\n\nHow soon will this transition be complete?\n\nThe time to complete this will depend on the individual subject in most cases. As with most drugs, the time will be shortened if the change is not to a significantly different kind of therapy, and if directly comparable tablets can be used. With amlodipine the ideal practice would be to reduce the dose from 1 week to 1 month, but in some cases it may be necessary to reduce the tablets more. In some cases, amlodipine may tolerate long term use, although these cases are definitely not the norm. For atenolol, it is generally preferred that such people have their regimens changed gradually. However, in some cases in which a significant amount is gained for each tablet, it may be preferable to use a short-term dose of atenolol and gradually reduce the dose of amlodipine to achieve a long term benefit.\n\nAt what point will my doctor inform me that I should begin Amlodipine to replace Atenolol?\n\nAfter the first visit, a doctor may prescribe a medication for you that is labeled as \u2018Amlodipine.\u2019 This is considered a generic medication. The physician has made the decision to prescribe you this medication, believing that there are still some advantages to it over the generic medications. However, you should ask your health care provider to provide any decision concerning the specific type and the potential dosage of the drug as soon as possible. This prescription will likely include the generic name of amlodipine for each type and the potential doses for that specific drug. The doses for different types of drugs can often vary significantly, so it is important to discuss the general recommendations for each drug with your doctor to ensure that all options have been thoroughly researched and considered before making any decisions.\n\nDo you know what brands of Amlodipine are available?\n\nYou may have heard of the brand name Amladipine from your doctor as it is the generic brand of a popular generic brand called Amlodipine. This is a generic brand that has many manufacturers that make Amlodipine.

European countries have previously approved the MPV vaccine for adults 60 years or older.\n\nWhy is the current shingles vaccine recommended for ages 50 years and over?\nThe risk for getting shingles increases with age starting around age 50 years. The study that demonstrated the benefit of immunization in reducing cases of shingles as well as its complications did not include adults who were younger than 50 years old. More clinical trials are planned to determine if the same measures of effectiveness can be found in younger age groups.\n\nHow is the shingles vaccine different than the vaccine for shingles given in a live virus formulation called the Zostavax vaccine?\nWhile both the Zostavax and the recently approved  MPV vaccine prevent cases of shingles and their complications, these two vaccines are chemically and biologically very different. The Zostavax is made out of a weakened form of varicella-zoster virus, which causes the usual symptoms associated with varicella or shingles. MPV has small proteins made from a carefully engineered microorganism that stimulate the patient\u2019s natural body defense system and protect the immune system against future infection.\n\nWhat are some of the other differences between MPV and the older Zostavax vaccine?\nDisadvantages of the Zostavax vaccine include the risk for both eczema herpeticum (this is a type of shingles that typically affects younger adults and is often more serious than other forms of shingles and is associated with severe scarring) and the risk for superficial viral shedding after vaccination, thus transmitting infection to other people. EPV is not associated with these risks.  MPV does not contain a live virus and may be administered to patients who cannot get the older live virus vaccine.  Additionally, Zostavax is given by injection, whereas MPV has a simpler application method through a patch.\n\nHow does the MPV vaccine work? Is it active in protecting against varicella zoster virus infection?\nMost patients do not have any side effects. However, about 10% may already have experienced a herpes zoster infection, in which", "It\u2019s called the Lasting Effect and it will last you a lifetime.

It is", "# How do I safely dispose of Hydrogen Peroxide?\n\nHow to dispose of hydrogen peroxide?\nWhen it comes to a health issue, like your jackhammering teeth, the instant answer is hydrogen peroxide. How did it become one of the trendiest dental treatments in town? Why do so many people do it? It can save you countless hours and dollars in going through a costly procedure. So how do you get this fun and easy procedure? You can either purchase hydrogen peroxide and take it home, or you can just apply the powder directly to the tooth and let it work.\nMany people have found that hydrogen peroxide dissolves more effectively than toothpaste. The reason for this is that toothpaste contains hydrogen peroxide, but it releases it at a slower pace. So it will work faster and get a stronger cleansing effect. If you do not want to pay for professional toothpaste, you can buy a product from your local drugstore that contains hydrogen peroxide. It will cost you about $15, but it is more effective. So if you have it, do it.\nIf you do not have hydrogen peroxide, you can still make use of your toothbrush. Just place the brush on the toothbrush cover, and inhale through your nose. This releases the peroxide into your mouth, killing the harmful bacteria in your mouth and whitening your teeth. The best part of this method is that you do not have to buy a toothbrush, and you do not have to worry about wasting any product.\nThe second method that you can make use of your toothbrush and hydrogen peroxide is to brush your teeth without taking a sip. You can use a small amount of peroxide at the start of the morning and a larger amount before you go to bed. You may have to make more trips to the dentist if you use this method, but it is sure to work better and give you the whiter teeth that you want.\nThe third way is to mix up a bit of water with a little bit of peroxide. Soak the toothbrush in the mixture, and leave it in your mouth for about ten minutes. The toothbrush will kill all the germs that are in your mouth and whiten the teeth. You can also try this method with a baby tooth", "Clorox and other brands of Hydrogen Peroxide is effective at fighting toxins; carcinogens and other harmful matter that settle on clothes, upholstery, carpets, shag rugs, vinyl flooring, plastic/rubber flooring, linens, mattresses, pillows, carpet fibers, drapery fabric, sofa fabric, power steering hoses, old tires, rubber hoses, car tires, many car parts, tires, stains, odors, cigarette and ashtray smell, contact injuries from animal feces and urine, germs, any type of body fluid, mold, mildew, bacteria, virusses, germs, fungi, yeast infection, yeast, etc. Clorox and other brands of Hydrogen Peroxide is not as effective on liquid stain, however, we recommend a spotter spray called Stain Out to remove most liquid stains.", "First understanding what it is important.\n\n> Hydrogen peroxide (Silo or Military Stock Number: 8195) is an oxidizing agent which is used for water purification and sterilization.

Any other way of disposal of this chemical has the potential to contaminate groundwater. Worth mentioning that using hydrogen peroxide in the household is an effective means to disinfect anything from fruits to chopping boards.\n\nWhat do you do with old contact solution?\n? (Compilation)\nJun 17, 2017\n2 11\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou may repeat the recycling process by putting the container and cap in the rinse cycle and reusing the peroxide solution.\n\nThis means the rinse solution from one Ultimate wash gets recycled into the first Ultimate wash of the next Ultimate cycle and/or any additional cycles as you go through your normal washing.

Such consanguinity is one of the numerous factors that could potentially contribute to the condition, and the individual risk is influenced by many factors including the specifics of the family's genetic makeup.Long-term pulmonary sequelae are possible, as untreated CDH can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, and potentially longer-term lung function abnormalities. However, with proper medical intervention and management, many individuals with CDH can have a good quality of life.", "Must_have": ["Congenital diaphragmatic hernia can occur as an isolated matter, part of a genetic syndrome, or chromosome abnormality, or along with additional unknown birth defects.", "Cases of CDH have been linked to certain gene mutations, use of certain medications during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, and having a parent with CDH."], "Nice_to_have": ["Marrying a cousin can slightly increase the risk of CDH in offspring, but the overall risk and impact are influenced by many factors.", "Long-term pulmonary sequelae, such as pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, may occur in untreated cases of CDH, leading to potential respiratory distress and longer-term lung function abnormalities.", "With appropriate medical intervention, many individuals with CDH can experience a good quality of life."], "sample_predictions": ["Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare birth defect that occurs in 1 in 2,500 live births. It is characterized by a defect in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. This defect allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, compressing the lungs and making it difficult for the baby to breathe.\n\nThe exact cause of CDH is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors include chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, and single-gene mutations, such as those that cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Environmental factors include maternal smoking, alcohol use, and exposure to certain medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n\nCDH can also be associated with other birth defects, such as heart defects, spinal cord defects, and kidney defects. In some cases, CDH may be caused by a genetic mutation that is passed down from one or both parents.\n\nLong-term pulmonary sequelae of CDH include chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory failure. These complications can lead to lifelong respiratory problems and a decreased quality of life.\n\nMarrying your cousin can increase the risk of having a child with a genetic disorder, including CDH. This is because cousins share a greater proportion of their genes than unrelated individuals, which increases the likelihood of inheriting a genetic mutation that causes CDH. However, the risk of having a child with CDH is still low, even if both parents are cousins.\n\nIn conclusion, CDH is a rare birth defect that can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It can be associated with other birth defects and can lead to long-term pulmonary sequelae. Marrying your cousin can increase the risk of having a child with a genetic disorder, including CDH, but the risk is still low.", "Congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH) account for about 1 per 2,500-3,500 deliveries (Robert & Abitbol, 2005).  They occur almost one-half of the time on the left;  the remainder are usually another \"hernia of the diaphragm\"\u2014a Bochdalek hernia, described below.\n\n\"Familial\" erhnias occur more commonly on the right. Genetic, gene-environment or other interaction in composition of the proteins of the diaphragm are proposed causes, but not yet demonstrated.\n\nCauses: \"Right and left-sided CDHs have a different aetiology.  The right sided type occurs more commonly in the setting of chromosomal anomalies, and Mendelson and his colleagues demonstrated that right sided CDHs are occasionally observed in infants with congenital mitotic dispersion (C-MyBD).  A study from Vogt and colleagues showed that the genetic analysis of 215 fetuses with right sided CDHs revealed a wide array of micro-deletions and other mutations, and Mendelson and colleagues showed that girls with cleft palate and 22q11 abnormalities are often complicated by CDH (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract).  Microsomal anomalies are also observed in females with right sided CDH, which include trisomy X, 5-10% of all cases; thoracic aortic absence (Aortic arch++) and bicuspid aortic valves, up to 20% of all cases: and the deficiency of specific factors of the sonic hedgehog signaling (2002; 2003)\" (Pathogenesis. 1996).\n\n- Oligohydramnios: absence of amniotic fluid precedes formation of CDH (Eunjung Park: 2011)\n- Maternal diabetes & Cigarette Smoking (Mellor 2002, Haehnel 2003 & 2006, Chchou J Oteola 2004) and valproic acid", "Are you kidding? Give us the cold, hard facts.\n\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia is a hole in the diaphragm (the muscle that separates our chest cavity from the abdominal cavity) that is present at birth. Your insides are in your chest, and the lungs are collapsed, which does not leave much room for them to expand. As you can imagine, babies that develop congenital diaphragmatic hernia require emergency surgery for repair. Preterm babies with this condition often have significant lung complications and pulmonary sequelae \u2014 meaning that they need oxygen therapy and assisted breathing during their hospital stay.\n\nNow, are all congenital diaphragmatic hernia babies born to parents who are related? Ewww, no. This is an autosomal dominant condition, so if you have one parent affected with a diaphragmatic hernia, your chances of having a child with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia is 50 percent. If both of your parents have a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and you and your partner each have a diaphragmatic hernia, then your chances are 100 percent \u2014 but remember, this is a super rare condition.\n\nBecause the incidence is so low, it\u2019s hard for doctors to predict the life expectancy and long-term prognosis for your child. It\u2019s in the literature that children who had congenital diaphragmatic hernia and do not require medicines such as oxygen, long-term sedation or steroid or diuretic for kidney function in the postoperative course seem to have relatively good pulmonary function as children, and their lung function is relatively close to normal. What is still unresolved is the long-term prognosis of these children. These children have the potential to live normal lives into their childbearing years, but no one\u2019s quite sure of the efficacy to have their own children, so this is another reason some of these babies get sterilization as part of their surgery.\n\nSo, I have to ask: have you heard of a family in which both the husband and wife have congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Would you consider that \u201cfair game\u201d in an episode of Yikes, I Married a Cuz", "What are the best predictors of long-term outcomes? Do ventilator-free days matter?\n\nThese are questions that can be posed to Dr. Michael Chulawat, a researcher at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital. Chulawat and his team have screened their database to share their institutional experience of diagnosing and treating patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).\n\nThis database represents the largest review of a single institution\u2019s experience with CDH.\n\nDr. Douglas Compton Keith Ruiz and Delphine Gris\u00e9, and Dr. Chulawat; pictured from left to right.\n\nWhat is the takeaway?\n\nSurvival rates are on the rise. Only our data should be used to predict long-term outcomes. Ventilator-free days ain\u2019t worth it. And predicting which side a hernia is on is science made easy.\n\n### They want all kinds\n\nA small amount of maternal-fetal medicine data captured in fetal echocardiograms was missing. But the big number to look at is the birth volume. Working out of a high-level neonatal intensive care unit with a high-level cardiac ICU and a healthy obstetrical service resulted in a CDH base of over 1,000 cases.\n\nThe population was diverse, 48% Caucasian. This means that the population could be low risk, for variances of the local population.\n\n### The data shows no new coffee orders\n\nGordon set up the lights to look at a little sample of how they crunched data \u2014 and it was a fine performance! They demonstrated that survival changed over time as the technologic capabilities for babies changed over time. Boy, oh boy, it was a good share. After these changes in technology, after these shifts in treatment, types of ECMO, placements, and sorts of medical technologies became accessible to CDH, survival massively increased.\n\nThey made their massive analysis on the idea that neonatal outcomes are substantially better when extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is readily available. In databases with no ECMO patients, outcomes drop by almost 10%!\n\nThis mirrors recent publications discussing the prognosis of those without ECMO support.\n\n### Is this the best", "Answers to all these questions below.\n\nWhat is congenital diaphragmatic hernia?\n\nThe diaphragm is a sheet of muscle tissue that passes horizontally across the body, separating the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. Most of the lung-supported organs (heart, lungs) and most of the diaphragm occupy the chest cavity. The stomach, colon, pancreas, kidneys, liver and sometimes a small part of the lung are in the abdominal cavity. Little else exists besides these organs in their respective cavities.\n\nBefore birth, the diaphragm has developed but is not fully closed or solid. A small opening in the upper part of each abdominal wall allows part of the intestines to enter the chest cavity, these organs can be pushed directly into the lung cavity and remain there. This causes the lung on that side of the body to not fully develop and sometimes removes the lung altogether on that side of the body. The risk of lung damage is greater with bilateral diaphragmatic hernia than with unilateral diaphragmatic hernia.\n\nSo the lung is damaged because it has to collide with stuff not meant to be there?\n\nYes,\n\nWhat are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia?\n\nThe exact causes behind the congenital diaphragmatic hernia are still unknown. It is not usually associated with any other diseases. But rarely, very weak diaphragms can herniate from severe fluid accumulation in the abdomen, after a ruptured appendix, infections or after surgery on the fetus^{1}. It may also occur if the embryo is forced inside its abdomen between 6-10 weeks of gestation^{2}.\n\nBasically, anything that forces the organs of those cavities out of their cavities can lead to congenital diaphragmatic hernia. These organs may also overlap.\n\nDo they still hurt when you grow up?\n\nKinda.\n\nTell me how.\n\nMuch like cystic fibrosis, lose a lot of stuff. Lung herniation is present in 85% of cases and the lungs continue to deteriorate until O2 saturation", "Ix keep on scrolling for answers to these questions in this article.\n\n## What is a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia?\n\nThe diaphragm is sheet protective membrane muscle which separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity forming the partition between chest and belly. It has openings on each side that allow passage of the esophagus and aorta from one side to the other. In the condition called congenital diaphragmatic hernia, these openings are somewhat larger than they ought to be, causing portions of the stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines to move into the chest cavity, known as a mediastinal hernia, taking up room needed by the lungs. Roughly half of fetuses that develop congenital diaphragmatic hernia will have the organization most malignant type which is named primary pulmonary hypertension. As the lungs are compressed by the organs inside the chest there is a possibility that the lungs won\u2019t fill up effectively with their staple big-name air. Therefore, on the contrary aspect of the heart, blood pressure is significantly increased.\n\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia causes abnormal development of the lungs, primarily the left lung. There is a hole or flaw in the diaphragm. Then again, the neighboring organs spill into the chest turning into the lungs, trapping the remaining space for the lungs they need and making them compressed (reducing lung volume) and causing them not to grow at that point.\n\n## Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia caused by a Punctuation\n\nThis is more common in females than males. Fertilization uses about half of sperm originating from father and about half from mother. The sperm are different and passed from the pacified oocyte, and when certain many genes from the dad are different from those originating from a mother there is a larger possibility of an anomaly to develop there will be a herniation inside the thoracic organ.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take note that through practice showing father-offspring genetic import, although it was shown that people working with the ailment are more inclined to offspring with the lung issue.

Here she offers good advice on how to prevent the spread of the shingles virus.\n\nIs the specific virus contagious in the workplace?\n\nAlthough the shingles virus (herpes varicella zoster) isn\u2019t as contagious as the cold or flu, you may contract the virus and be exposed to it at the same time that someone in your office has shingles.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, you\u2019ll likely get chickenpox after exposure to the shingles virus; the flu shot should decrease your risk of contracting the varicella virus.\n\nThose of you who\u2019ve already had chickenpox but never got the shingles virus as an adult should be careful around someone with shingles. Consult with your doctor about whether you should receive a zoster vaccine. Only two out of every 100 people diagnosed with shingles contract it from another person.\n\nHow to prevent the spread of the virus\n\nYou should never pass shingles to another person by shaking hands or even touching, unless there is a clear exchange of bodily fluids.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to make sure the virus doesn\u2019t spread:\n\n- Cover areas where you are rapidly losing skin \u2013 the rash and fluid-filled blisters in particular \u2013 with loose fitting clothing so you do not directly exchange body fluids with other people.\n- Be sure you are confined to your home where you can take the necessary steps to prevent the virus from spreading and avoid small children who\u2019ve never had chickenpox; you can expect children who\u2019ve already had chickenpox and received the proper vaccines to be more resistant to developing shingles from your exposure.\n- Evaluate your stress level \u2013 Neuroepidemiologists at Warrick Point University researched one outbreak of shingles and found that most of the elderly people who contracted the virus during the trial had lived together in a residence with a fair amount of stress", "There are bacterium or viruses that can make people ill, especially when they\u2019re working in close contact with the diseased individual.\n\nLet me tell you how it manifests.\n\nOne, if you have chicken pox in the past, you\u2019re going to get shingles.\n\nChicken pox causes scar and damages the DNA of the nerve ganglion (nerve endings). It\u2019s like a shrub. If it continues to manifest, it\u2019s bound to generate a problem, and alters the DNA.\n\nThe DNA elicits a message to the immune system that repairs the nerve endings and the embryological tissue. It becomes inflamed and pustular. It slowly develops sores on the skin. That\u2019s where the pain develops.\n\nOn top of that, the chicken pox virus becomes dormant. The dormant (napping) chicken pox virus will not manifest till in your 60s or 70s, and is bound to develop the pain. There\u2019s no escape from the pain because it\u2019s the DNA messaging the immune system and the infection and inflammation process.\n\nThat means, you\u2019re not going to be taking painkillers. Gabapentin, prednisone, and other drugs don\u2019t offer the cure akin to alcohol acting on glutamine, the cytokine, the immune system and inflammation process. That\u2019s the curse of chicken pox.\n\nBack to my question. It ought to be a closed door policy. Bring the case to the doctor\u2019s attention and let the doctor decide if he\u2019s fit for work in a kitchen. It\u2019s not about the medication. It\u2019s about the cure which is sustainable because millionaires are hatched out of shingles. Multimillionaires are made out of the shingles virus.\n\nWhat did I do? I isolated myself from people close such as parents, uncles, aunties, friends, neighbors and siblings during that incubation period. Otherwise it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nAuthor's Bio:\n\nYou are the only doctor for yourself. You owe it because health is Wealth. The hormone: antibody completes the trio: glutamine (precursor amino acid). Test the levels and get it right because you're on your own. I believe that", "Is it necessary for a nonimmune individual, food prepper, to be quarantined from any food preparation?\n\nYes, the varicella-zoster virus that causes shingles is contagious, and yes, a food preperato (at least in the USA) is a food handler.  Indeed, HACCP recommends that food handlers wash their hands frequently for good food safety.  Yet, shingles appears to be more infectious than the common cold. (First using the common cold http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/31108as a strict comparison, shingles is a herpes virus so what one individual might call its less infectiousness owing to this herpes family of viruses might be somewhat skewed.)\n\nWhy is this a question? Well if you are popping your forehead with shingles a thousand times a day it is likely normal to put down the hands you are using for scratching to wash dishes or to clean groceries.  You don\u2019t want the shingles virus from your congested forehead to find its way on your kitchen hands.\n\nSo the \u201cquarantine,\u201d as the US-based food nutritionist who asked this question used nonimmune, refers to the fact that even a healthcare professional handling food, medicine, or equipment cold have their own health become a public health concern if they accidentally touched something a non-infectious shingle-free individual can get infected.\n\nThe remedial advice then for food preparation is that a nonimmune prepper needs to join auto-quarantine during shingles episode. Wash your hands frequently if you are not eating them.HACCP rules and such might or might not suggest you go nor eat a shingle inflicted dish of food, but that also is a nutritional risk so you could be quarantined from shingle-on food entirely while in the shingle period.\n\n### Definitions\n\nAs the received and common question leaves us, you should define in all professional agreements that a food worker, whether parent, child, community, institutional, or other sort work setting or job title is understood as a food handler.\n\nIn the canned and dispensable HACCP, as we understand in the US and internationally, an employee (among other things", "A reader asks can anyone else catch shingles from me?\n\nShe writes: \u201cIt is advertised that shingles is highly contagious but I do not know how that is possible.

Unfortunately, context when it comes to anything with APS is so limited. I find is very difficult to find any statistics or facts or even other sufferers on google. It is inevitable that this is going to be the case with a disease that affects so few people. However, this begs the question, how many sufferers are there?\n?\nIn the UK alone the estimated cases of APS are said to reach a total 5,000. However Dr Richard W. Tilley, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a chief medical consultant at the Vasculitis Foundation, says it\u2019s very unlikely that APS is as seldom diagnosed as the national health service states, claiming the figures are a very \u201cgross understatement\u201d.\n?\nNational health services suggest that his is in the region of 5000 across the UK. I ask, how is that possible? When I first started my initial research into APS I found 70% of people diagnosed with APS are female. I was also shocked to learn that about 10 women out of 100,00 live through their pregnancy, I thought I was lucky to live through day 3 of my pregnancy due to complications caused APS. So just imaging how many of you reading this have lost your pregnancies due to complications caused by APS.\n?\nOn the flip side another report held in the United States in 2010 stated that 5mg/ml was the most common group of APS sufferers. 5mg/ml being the positive test that means you show APS signs in your blood.

They may experience symptoms and signs such as anxiety, nausea, pain abdomen, joint pain, flushing. Also, people may experience low grade fever and chills after stopping the drug. This is generally seen in people who are on monthly dose of minor corticotropin (Acthar Gel), a gel containing adrenocorticotropic hormone. For your question concerning the duration in which the medicine stays after discontinuation, you will have to know about the retention of time after taper as followed below;\n\nDuration of half life: Predinsone has a short period of retention in the body. Approximately a seven days, it is totally removed and it is advisable to take a small dose with food until levels distributed in the body are reduced further. Although this steroid drug is water-soluble; it is not cash necessarily taken up and throw out in urine. There is another chemical that is produced in the body that allows the Prednisone molecule to remain in the system. When release is untimely, the drug may negatively impact the adrenal glands and create imbalance of overall weight and motility. It still stays on the urine for up to five days and exit out first in the blood stream.\n\nRecommendation and caution: Always consult with your physician before limiting or reducing the amount of a drug. Especially, this Prednisone can be severing as it affects the same corticosteroid lacking hormones rereleased by the adrenal gland. The corticosteroid hormone is essential for the body to fight against inflammation and stress levels. Without proper suggestion from doctor, a wrongful stoppage of the drug can activate swelling of the appendicitis.

Some of the chemicals are specifically coded to the amino acids that cause the immune system to react. As a result, there is a coded invasion of the cells with these messages of immune system reactivity. This coded reaction is the beginning of the immune system reacting to the epitelioid sarcoma.\n\nEpitelioid sarcoma can be very difficult to diagnose. When I was in medical school, we were not trained in this specialty. I know when I first started practicing medicine, we were told that this was a very rare cancer which was not treatable. I did not know how many cases you could see in a lifetime. I remember one of my first patients with this very rare malignancy.\n\nHe was at the hospital for several days, and he had already passed all their tests. Because of this low likelihood of diagnosis, he had an unusual chest x-ray. I still remember his x-ray being reviewed.\n\nOne of the few patients in my practice is a patient who had a terrible recurrence of this cancer. He presented with pain and swelling in his left inguinal inguinal groin. after his first year of treatment with other types of medical doctors in Houston, he found out that the cancer had already caused some pancreatic cancer to develop while it was still occurring in his abdomen the same month that this was diagnosed.\n\nHe began treatment with chemotherapy and radiation after he came to Houston with his family. After one chemotherapy regimen, the tumor shrunk to the size of a grape. After two additional sessions of chemotherapy, the tumor shrunk to the size of a cashew, again at the same time. Finally, the patient decided to have another cycle of chemotherapy because the cancer had not been able to kill the cancerous cells in the liver and at that time, it was still unclear what type of treatment he would be undergoing.\n\n While the diagnosis\n\n## How Long After Prednisone Do Fatigue And Cramping Subside?\n\nThis blog is a frequently asked question about the can you get prednisone", "Depends on who is asking, of course. If you eat prednisone and fatty acids, stomach acid would dissolve the prednisone. Prednisone is water soluble, so it should go into the urine in two days' time. What was the dosage being taken? How long were you on the prednisone? You can get some poor patients who take high doses of prednisone for long periods sometime years who would have a withdraw depression for about three to six months. You can get these in other bad diseases no matter what the prednisone was taken for. I will tell you I used prednisone and its family for twenty years for methotrexate pursuing. I found I was going to bladder cancer at age 31 and I got therapy and surgery and I am still here today. I look at things through a really long tunnel, that is methotrexate and cortisone.\nPosted on Fri, 3 Dec 2010 in Drugs & Medical Supplies\n\nAnswered by Dr. Tan Ai Choo 59 minutes later\nHello,\n\nGenerally, prednisone will be eliminated in the body via excretion through the tissues, faeces and urine within 18-36 hours after its administration. However, it may be longer in people with haemodialysis or renal dysfunction.\n\nOverdosage of prednisone requires prompt emergency medical attention. Signs and symptoms of prednisone overdose can include mental and behavioral changes (especially if used with amphetamines), fast or irregular heartbeat, rapid or shallow breathing and possibly coma. Fluid retention due to prednisone overdose is usually short-lived and symptoms may go away within 1-2 weeks after the drug is stopped. But depending on your specific case, these symptoms may be longer, eg., 1-2 months.\n\nAlso, withdrawal symptoms may also occur on stopping prednisone, especially when using high doses of long term steroid medications like prednisone. This may include joint aches and pains, fatigue, grumpiness, headaches, fever, loss of appetite, muscle weakness etc. These will generally resolve in 1-2 weeks and you can discuss further with your doctor regarding your symptoms.\n\nI hope I have answered", "Prednisone is just one of the many 'steroids', a class of drugs that includes a large number of compounds that are completely unrelated except their similarity in structure. Indeed they have completely different pharmacological actions and differ in strength. The only two compounds that usually have any significant action in men are Prednisone and Testosterone.\n\nHow to take the medication depends upon what form you get, and what dose you have been prescribed. The range is about 5mg to 200mg, but the dose may vary from 1mg to 200mg during the lifetime of the individual. The lower doses are given in 20, 40 and 60mg sizes, usually in one dose. The higher doses are given in tabs in each dose, such as 5, 10 or 15mg, and usually in one dose by using 2 capsules, the same as your testosterone dose. It is done to lower your hormone level to a more natural level.\n\nPrednisone (or prednisolone) can cause a lot of side effects, many of which are temporary, but some can last a life time, even if you stop using them. For example, if you stop using prednisolone quickly, you will probably have \"raging mania\", lasting days or weeks. Even long-term use (more than two years) can cause personality changes.\n\nYou shouldn't use steroids if you're pregnant, or you're breastfeeding.\n\nPrednisone is generally considered OK for bodybuilding, IF tolerated. In large doses it can disrupt your endocrine systems (thyroid, hypothalamus, pituitary), brains cortisone production, liver function, kidney function, muscle, etc. It will likely cause you to gain weight and be susceptible to muscle damage. It may cause a rash on your face, neck, chest, and hands. It's sometimes used in hospitals to lower blood sugar and may cause you to lower your cholesterol. It's probably the most abused drug in the gym. It's taken in conjunction with training. It should be used in small doses.^\n\nI am a new user of Prednisone.

We all are born with them. I can not prove I born with them because I was a premie. Add a node to your question.  I'm having difficulty with clicking to add more, I will add more and take off this I as soon as I am able. Hi there?Will Schmorl's node begin to outgrowth at the actual bone spur?\n\nno pain persist on pinhead.I went to a Chiropractor in March. But, he never applied to me in a position to do it correctly. Why did the 2 spots begin to grow on my pinhead?\nLearning the distortion in pinhead structure  then the bilateral (one either side) nodes I can not logically Imagine there isn't any link.\n\nThanks for the split into two nodes I mean to explain in order about the fact that I believe that there is a connection due to the pinhead on my back being great enough to create a bilateral form of recognized allignment throughout the length from the first back. Pulling the line in the vertebra down to pinhead and then splitting one other side not noticable enough to form either distinct nodes.\nLet us look at the reason why pinhead occurs of alignment of the middle vertebra down along the bottom of the first one arising at the end of the vertebral arch with incidence at pinhead which does split the appendages 1/2 inch or more with incidence aligning the two nodes bilateral one under each pinhead with one or two appendages forming the bilateral nodes and producing a symetrical rib on the correct side to the appendage with indirects aligning to every rib.\nShould Jackson Pubdoor be used.

What can I do to speed up recovery??\n\nLet me say at the outset that vertebral endplate fractures, mostly when they involve the narrow anterior part of the endplate, are known as Schmorl's nodes (also Schmorl's nodules).\n\nThe nodes or nodules are a source of some discomfort and tenderness, but mostly the pain accompanying them is attributed to the concomitant damage to surrounding structures, namely the posterior endplate and other more superficially located soft tissues.\n\nIt is true that such lesions may result in permanent weakness of bones and that may be a factor that needs to be taken into account. One fact that is worth knowing is that school age gymnasts are prone to suffer from this condition (often on the part of the back).\n\nWith all that being said, I will also share with you an excerpt from my book Fundamentals of Cervical and Lumbar Disorders (in 3 parts).\n\nVertebral fracture is denoted by disruption of the ribs surrounding one or more vertebrae of the cervical and lumbar spine. This type of injury often has a justifiable cause, for example jumping off a tall building and landing on the ground on the buttocks. However, jumping from a chest of drawers onto the floor or even tripping over a dog and landing on the buttocks, falling down the stairs, landing on the floor with the knees or the trunk may also cause vertebral fractures.\n\nThe real reason the patient was admitted was described as 'lingering head pain'. The symptoms had occurred several weeks following injury. The patient, a thirty-three-year-old firefighter, had been on nightshift for several days. He had been drinking (20-25 pints) and hardly slept. We were told that on several other occasions before this one, when he had had too much to drink, an accident followed\u2014another reason to suspect head injury.\n\nAfter"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1329, "rouge1_r": 0.0667, "rouge1_f1": 0.0888, "rouge2_p": 0.0064, "rouge2_r": 0.0032, "rouge2_f1": 0.0042, "rougel_p": 0.0949, "rougel_r": 0.0476, "rougel_f1": 0.0634, "bleurt": 0.3523, "bert_score_p": 0.7395, "bert_score_r": 0.802, "bert_score_f1": 0.7695, "hallucination": 88.88888888888889, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3291, "rouge1_r": 0.149, "rouge1_f1": 0.2051, "rouge2_p": 0.0318, "rouge2_r": 0.0144, "rouge2_f1": 0.0198, "rougel_p": 0.1709, "rougel_r": 0.0774, "rougel_f1": 0.1065, "bleurt": 0.2086, "bert_score_p": 0.7946, "bert_score_r": 0.8221, "bert_score_f1": 0.8081, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3038, "rouge1_r": 0.172, "rouge1_f1": 0.2197, "rouge2_p": 0.0255, "rouge2_r": 0.0144, "rouge2_f1": 0.0184, "rougel_p": 0.1329, "rougel_r": 0.0753, "rougel_f1": 0.0961, "bleurt": 0.2564, "bert_score_p": 0.7872, "bert_score_r": 0.8246, "bert_score_f1": 0.8055, "hallucination": 88.88888888888889, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4177, "rouge1_r": 0.1719, "rouge1_f1": 0.2435, "rouge2_p": 0.0318, "rouge2_r": 0.0131, "rouge2_f1": 0.0185, "rougel_p": 0.1835, "rougel_r": 0.0755, "rougel_f1": 0.107, "bleurt": 0.24, "bert_score_p": 0.7862, "bert_score_r": 0.8181, "bert_score_f1": 0.8018, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.1962, "rouge1_r": 0.2696, "rouge1_f1": 0.2271, "rouge2_p": 0.0191, "rouge2_r": 0.0263, "rouge2_f1": 0.0221, "rougel_p": 0.1013, "rougel_r": 0.1391, "rougel_f1": 0.1172, "bleurt": 0.271, "bert_score_p": 0.8211, "bert_score_r": 0.8105, "bert_score_f1": 0.8158, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 20.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.443, "rouge1_r": 0.1902, "rouge1_f1": 0.2662, "rouge2_p": 0.051, "rouge2_r": 0.0218, "rouge2_f1": 0.0305, "rougel_p": 0.2025, "rougel_r": 0.087, "rougel_f1": 0.1217, "bleurt": 0.282, "bert_score_p": 0.8056, "bert_score_r": 0.8401, "bert_score_f1": 0.8225, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 20.0}]}

The sounds you hear are frequently repetitive.\n3. Having an irritating sense on your cheek is one of the most common symptoms of sleep paralysis.\n4.

Therefore, there are no outliers in terms of potential sources.\n\n### Men Are More Dependent On Alcohol\n\nNumerous studies and reports claim that males are more likely to engage in substance addiction than females. While it is debatable, there is evidence to support the presence of alcoholic men in sleep paralysis. However, there are several similar reports of alcohol in sleep paralysis, which could disprove this myth. Hence, increasing gender egalitarianism is the best strategy.\n\n### Stress Is Tied To Sleep Paralysis\n\nStress sometimes relieves sleep paralysis, just like many other diseases. The truth is that the aforementioned is a symptom of sleep paralysis rather than a cause. Even the strongest person alive may experience stress. Even still, tension affects everybody equally. Stress may be relieved by Chinese medicine.\n\n### People Who Frequently Travel Experience This More Often\n\nThis assertion crops up from time to time, despite its vagueness. Sleep paralysis can impact travelers on an international and local level. All you need to believe it is if you think it.", "Mostly reported by people in the general age range of twenty five to thirty-five, sleep paralysis is defined as a phenomenon where, a person partially or completely wakes from sleep only to find that she or he is unable to move for some moments.\n\nYou are essentially awake, but unable to do so much as move your eye balls. Most of the reported cases deal with the body\u2019s lack of motor function, such as the aforementioned eye movements, lack of ability to move but also in the different spans of time between each \u2018wake\u2019.\n\nThe length of time for which an episode of sleep paralysis lasts for, apparently, varies from a few seconds long, to almost an hour.\n\nSome cases have reported on the presence of vibrasl\u014dso, or background moving sensations across the skin, during this phenomenon.\n\nFor the more cinematic, we can say that the person feels a pressure on their chest and they can barely breathe while sleeping.\n\nMost mammalian mammals go through sleep paralysis to some effect; however, humans are the primary mammal to experience it over the course of their sleeping episodes. In addition to that, some people may go through it more than once and be somewhat cognizant of its existence, while others find it to be a one-time occurrence. The dreams that come during these episodes, however, may or may not contain fright beliefs, and are supposedly called hypnagogic hallucinations. You have more likely seen them described as intense nightmare or bad nightmares.\n\nNew researches show that the prevalence of this condition can be hooked back to our ancestral roots as the evolutionary connection. Primitive humans in genealogy spend far more time on the ground and were way less safe than we are today.\n\nThe most surprising possibility among them is the evening, when they needed to consider predators, while they attempted to sleep through the night. This essentially meant that the people who drifted off to a light sleep more quickly slept better and had most of their individuals survive to birth their young.\n\nIn studies, researchers found that the sonography suffers from sleep paralysis frequently than others, while also dealing with panic and depression because of the phenomenon.\n\nWhat is posthypnotic suggestion? The phenomenon that sleep paralysis is believed in relation to panic attacks and stress.\n\nWhile a number", "Our sleep cycles...\n\nWhat is sleep paralysis and how does it affect the body? Our sleep cycles contain several stages that allow our brain to cycle through the appropriate parts of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. We all experience periods of REM sleep that help with other parts of our brains, including memory through the formation of memories and constituting our dream life. Our bodies experience paralysis during REM sleep in order for us to conserve energy while we \u2018sleep\u2019 and not act out our dreams subconsciously. While many who sleep experience this paralysis in their sleep cycles, there are others who experience \u2018out of cycle\u2019 episodes that are threatening and painful. Not only are sleep conditions due to abnormal amounts of paralysis in the cycle spent sleeping, but they also happen because of where the sleep is spent and the state of the experiences.\n\nOur sleep cycles must remain in the proper balance for our bodies to function and transition properly between sleep and wakeful states. If they are made out of proportion, it can cause negative feelings, sleep paralysis, and grow anxiety about sleeping in certain spaces. The biggest culprit of sleep paralysis is restless leg syndrome or RLS for short. This is a disorder that causes sufferers to feel the urge to move different parts of their bodies, especially the legs, because of discomforts. RLS is often caused by many other health issues and ailments. Bipolar Disorder, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Spinal Injuries, Multiple Sclerosis, Migraines, Caffeine, and Ritalin can all cause an increase risk or perpetuate sleep paralysis. The inability to move all parts of your body during a sleeping cycle can cause you to feel as though you can\u2019t wake up. This is called sleep paralysis and occurs during the transitional stage between wakefulness and sleep. Some cases of sleep paralysis can create feelings of suffocation, \u2018presence\u2019 feeling, chest-pressure and more.\n\nThe way that sleep and sleep paralysis both affect a body are similar to that of a wakeful state. The transition period between movements and the onset of sleep can often be uncomfortable and painful for those susceptible to sleep paralysis. This state can feel similar to hypnotism which is a force of a will outside of your body that makes it beneficial. We all have had storm dreams or", "Here is our insight into the most famous dreams.\n\nUndoubtedly, we have all heard about sleep paralysis, or we\u2019ve experienced it. For those of you who have never hears about sleep paralysis this is the sensation of being awake but unable to move. Sleep Paralysis can be described as a \u201csleep disorder,\u201d but let\u2019s be honest, when you are a victim of this strange condition you don\u2019t feel you have a disorder\u2014you just can\u2019t do anything but to watch your bad dreams.\n\nWhy are we unable to move? According to Steve Mazer, Professor of Neurology, sleep paralysis is the result of an evolutionary process that stops us from acting out upon our dreams. We are unable to move because our nervous system is sending signals to our muscles to relax therefore it builds some kind of \u201cprotective shell\u201d around us\u2026\n\nThe phenomenon of sleep paralysis is nothing new. Anthropologists found many ancient examples of sleep paralysis and even discovered its origins in the medical-to-mysticism Hindu sect the Chira of Magadha, which happens to be the same sect where Freud practiced.\n\nTherefore sleep paralysis is more common than we think, and it might even be linked evolutionarily and historically to poltergeist and demonic possession. While amazingly there is no specific treatment for sleep paralysis, but here are some tips to try to shorten the time of sleep paralysis.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n89% off\nMicrosoft Office Professional 2021 Lifetime License\n\n- Increase exposure to sunlight and avoid light at night.\n- Avoid late night TV. Watching TV for more than two hours at night might make one feel anxious, and this might be responsible for triggering night terror episodes.\n- Avoid use of sleeping pills.\n- Visualization techniques, or practicing Mental Rehearsal is also effective; this can be as simple as picturing yourself opening the door in the morning. The goal is to begin a shift in consciousness.\n\nWhen the body learns to balance and control arousal to one\u2019s fullest, one is better able to avoid the evolutionary state of sleep paralysis, which is thought to be when one recalls experiences or dreams from past life regressions.  It\u2019s difficult for me to imagine someone", "A scary sleep disorder known as sleep paralysis is not as rare as many people think. This terrifying, and sometimes deadly, disorder can have debilitating effects on the body.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever woken up and couldn\u2019t move your body, you\u2019ve experienced sleep paralysis. This can be scary for anyone, even someone just trying to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. It is often triggered by low pressure in the sinus cavity, and typically is associated with uneven brainwave frequencies. Staying in a single body position (such as sleeping on your side or stomach) for too long can also trigger sleep paralysis apart from basic brainwave issues.\n\nSleep paralysis is bound to happen to anyone at some point. It\u2019s nature\u2019s method of keeping you from moving at all times while you sleep. Paralysis occurs during a transitional state between normal sleep and awake, and lasts for as long as two minutes or as little as five seconds. After this time, most people are able to move their bodies again and feel fully awake. However, many people have trouble getting back to sleep because of this.\n\nTypes of Sleep Paralysis\n\nThere are two main types of sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic (which is when the sleep begins) and hypnopompic sleep paralysis (which is when sleep ends).\n\nWhen individuals experience hypnagogic sleep paralysis, they actually feel like they are falling through space at rapid speed, with a cold spirit trying to choke them at the same time. Experts have indicated that individuals who suffer from hypnagogic sleep paralysis may be more likely to suffer from anxiety, which is debilitating in itself.\n\nWith hypnopompic sleep paralysis, individuals are more apt to experience out-of-body experiences, disassociation, or hallucinations. Experts have discovered that hypnopompic sleep paralysis may cure sleepwalking and provide a sense of ease for victims, but it often leaves them feeling too exhausted throughout the entire day.\n\nSleep paralysis can happen to anyone, and most often only lasts for a short amount of time. However, it can often leave the victim feeling scared.

As asthmatics adrenaline is diminished, focus your time working HARDER with less intensity, in a shorter period of time \u2013 now that\u2019s the work I see during lecture!\n\nThe same lecture programme outlined forgiveness, discrepancies in care, hospital, to say the least.  Today\u2019s fitness programmes for asthmatics fall into disarray.\n\nI remember an asthma patient, 21 years ago, in training!\n\nHe was very healthy, a nice young Italian guy, 23 and with easily controlled asthma problems.  He took", "There was a time when asthma was a significant liability in the sports area. Some sporting events still ban asthmatics from participating, such as marathons and Test cricket. In the 1970s and 1980s I used to receive requests from asthmatic athletes, keen to train hard, but looking for a simple, safe regime to help them do so. Today, there are very much more options for conditioning the lungs and improving stamina for asthmatic exercise. G.

The modernist design is obviously popular with the congregants \u2013 most Sundays, you see a long line of shiny cars for the late SMIRh. Ever since, I confess, my petty Protestant sympathies were piqued. I feel I am missing something. I was recently invited by another friend to attend a buddhist kungyo.

From the headlines to local news, we hear there is not enough being done and that the problems is all too difficult to fix. Scientists, economists, politicians and politicians begrudge us, while we throw money, scientific ideas and funds into an area that may again yield any political subsidies or end up on a Deadline Talk delicate subject appears when the address caused havoc in the markets. In this environment, it is not hard to understand how politicians and elders don\u2019t want to proceed with the unprecedented climate challenge.

Walking, running and biking with my children are some of our favourite activities. Through out my adult life, I\u2019ve exercised and been active. I just started playing volleyball and have found that all of normal activities trigger my asthma, especially my inhaler use. My asthma has been under control, and I\u2019m a healthy weight. My doctor says that I shouldn\u2019t have an problem moving easily and said that I really shouldn\u2019t have to take my inhaler when we are active and like most of us, we do a little bit of everything. I go for walks on the trails, but am curious if there is any aerobic exercises you might recommend that will be lower impact. I have tried the \u201cget fit in 12\u201d and something felt wrong. All of my medications are at the level the they should be and my doctor said that I really should be able to move easily. So, I know it has something to do with exercise, because last summer when I took the summer off, I couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nNot sure if I answered any of your questions, but if you have any for me, let me know. Kathryn\n\nHi Kathryn\n\nFirst of all good on you for being active and for walking with your kids! The longer you do this the easier most of the time it will be for you and the easier your inhaler will become to use. That being said \u2013\n\nThere has been loads and loads of studies about respiratory fitness which means in very simple terms the ability of your lungs to keep working when you start working (the real time definition is obviously much fancier). I\u2019ve seen studies that have shown an increase in ability of those with severe asthma to work out more, run longer, drink more before stopping for a drink of water. Basically everything with the lungs. The length of time your lungs continue working increases as your do more and more activity. A good analogy that a colleague used is \u2013 Drink more water than air. If your body has a good oxygen level, you will feel better. Other activities included leg movement, pumping your arms which all help to add more oxygen into your system and therefore dilate your airways and make it easier for you to breath, run, walk", "Exercise will definitely help with asthma. A warm up works well, for about five minutes. It helps get your heart rate up. Walking is a good exercise; you can do this year-round at a fast pace. You don\u2019t have to walk five kilometers to warm up your body; you could just walk two to three blocks, three times.\n\nWhen you become short of breath, start walking with the young, thin, and tall treetops. The air is thinner and cleaner. Another type of warm up would be to use a stationary bicycle for about 15 minutes.\n\nIf you do too much of an activity for too long, your muscles will start using the oxygen in the blood. You oxygenate your body more when you breathe faster and deeper. When you increase your salt, protein, and mineral intake the more salt makes you retain water, which in turn causes swelling in the airways.\n\nHigh carbohydrate foods should be eaten, which causes you to lose mucus in your body, then your cools and heat from adding salt. High protein foods take away the excess sweat of salty things, and plant free foods with very little mucus, and water causes you to retain mucus.\n\nWHY doctors say no dummy masturbation with children?\n\nDoctors frown on doing the busts with boys when they are as young, as that can cause damage to the penis. The reason it can cause damage is because they are too small. They don\u2019t have the sexual stimulation that for instance, a 40-year old man could get from.\n\nHe has the sexual thoughts and needs. So his techniques need to vary, because a rich ideo-like flush is the same way. Take a boy with a youngster may need to masturbate himself. He really gives his growth hormones a try. Once they are older, it is better to have them go to a prostitute. Just because you are male doesn\u2019t mean that you have the right buckets. It can be very damaging, to the personal self to do that when you don\u2019t have sexual urges.\n\nWHAT foods can I eat, being a vegetarian?\n\nUnless you\u2019ve gone to all of the above described categories, you should usually only have vegetables and fruits.

Read a related article that explores: Cephalexin vs. Penicillin.", "Answer:\n\nPeople often ask if they are allergic to one antibiotic can they be allergic to others?\nThe drugs industry often use different raw materials for one and the same drug, so that supplier problems do not lead to drug shortages. One raw material could be of animal and one of vegetable origin. One of the reasons the allicin in Penicillin is the well known curative and antibiotic is its vegetable source and relation to garlic. When people are allergic to penicillin it is usually the penicillin protein material that they are sensitive too, that is, animal protein penicillin, which can be obtained from allicin derived substances such as garlic. The animal protein is what most often stimulates the allergic reaction from peanuts and shellfish.\n\nIn general, the allergical reaction may more than likely also be observed if it is verses, ras Katta Varga, vidhartha, sharir arava, etc.\n\nThe human body also considers corn, soy, sunflower and safflower seed oil and the flowers of these herbs to be different and will hive responses if a reaction is observed. This is why over the past decade, one can read many ingestion recalls, warnings against certain drugs, adverse drug reactions, even false indicators in study data and problems with hormone implants, etc.\n\nThis allergic sensitivity of the human body is not dependent upon the pharmacology or chemistry of the substance. This seems to have led to endless numbers of pseudoallergies, to varying degrees of levels. Although the pharmacology or chemistry is not the problem, the herbs do not work any better than synthetic drugs. From one side this justification may appear to be true since in different cultures, in India, and herbal formulas are very specific and there are many improvements in treatment and reduction in side effects in general with natural herbal remedies and why types of herbal remedies work better than others. When a particular plant is used to make a special ointment, cream, lotion, or other remedy, this particular plant will have that specialized function. Some of the plants are active in atleast forty and upto thousands of areas inculding steroid hormones and sex and physical functioning of the organs of the body. This exceptional quality in plants will not be found in", "Both medicines are used to treat bacterial infections. Penicillin is a type of antibacterial medicine. Basically, they work the same way in killing and inhibiting the growth of bacteria.\n\nAllergic reaction to Penicillin may not automatically transmit to other type of antibacterial (water soluble drugs) like Cephalexin.\n\nHowever, if you have never tried to take Cephalexin before and had a yellow or brown\u6d3e\u98a8\u96e8\u4eba\u5f71\u5c0f\u9ce5\u0432\u044a\u0440 tap roadlight\u97ad\u5b50\u5e26\u8272\u4fe1\u4ef0\u9686\u8272\u70b9\u706f above or had swelled lips, skin lesions like rashes, feeling weak, faces like red, sudden respiratory difficulty, cases of feeling itchy and had fever, it would be wise that you inform your doctor before taking Cephalexin.\n\nYou must remember that, allergy to one drug may just not simply mean the same allergy to others.\n\nJust because you are allergic to sting, does not mean you will also be allergic to bee sting.\n\nJust because you are allergic to bee sting dose not mean you will be allergic to wasp sting.\n\nBoth Cephalexin and Penicillin are basically the same antibiotic medicine. The only difference is that the expiration date of Cephalexin is a little bit shorter than Penicillin.

Alcohol ablation or catheter ablation is two ways of eliminating extrasystoles or an arrhythmia. Read on to learn more!\n\nYou may have been told by your doctor that you have an arrhythmia. A rapid or irregular heartbeat is known as an arrhythmia. Your heartbeat is, in essence, your pulse measured at your fingertips, and the rate at which blood pumps through your body in a natural heartbeat or pulse, which is roughly 60 to 100 beats per minute at rest and can reach 180 beats per minute during vigorous exercise. Your blood travels spherically through your heart via veins into small chambers on the right and left sides called the atrium, which collect and move blood into the right ventricle. The mitral valve, the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve, and the aortic valve release the blood from the right and left ventricles into the lungs and the body, respectively, to be oxygenated and pumped (cardiac chambers).\n\nIrregular heartbeats caused by this process are not always recognized as arrhythmias, even if they do not match a fixed rate. Arrhythmia is described as \u201ca term that refers to an unusual or inconsistent heart rhythm,\u201d and irregularity in the pulmonary or cardiac system. You may have an irregular pulse. There are four types of extra heartbeats that are referred to as premature beat.\n\nIt is called a PVC if you have a premature atrial contraction. ST segment changes, QRS widening, and T-wave changes are all seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram). By treating the underlying cause of the ventricular arrhythmia, this might relieve symptoms and decrease arrhythmic events. It\u2019s akin to roadblocks in the circular route, which are made of prisms. An arrhythmia is a normal part of life; this is how it sounds to a doctor. Even the planet\u2019s state of well being demands regular maintenance, don\u2019t you think? Arrhythmias, like other illnesses, need instant treatment.\n\n## The most frequent approaches are electrical shock (defibrillation) and the use of medications.\n\nBoth of these surgical procedures have a", "Is ablation necessary heart ablation Yes, 90 percent of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation cure after ablation, and 70-80 percent of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation application of ablation alone. The success rate of other arrhythmias can also be over 99%. The outcome at the beginning of the atrial fibrillation surgery was not good, only 30% of patients after the surgery, and therapeutic effect 35% The patient suffered from ventricular fibrillation due to decreased shortness of breath. The high success rate of ablation surgery has brought great hope to patients. How to detect abnormal heart electrical activity during radiofrequency ablation Insulator HEMP burner RFA Occasionally ultra-high frequency repeat HEMP invades the normal activity of the myocardial cells to cause damage to the stretch receptors. Although electrophysiological ablation is a relatively new technology, the traditional surgical resection of the main pulmonary veins is still used worldwide as the main treatment for patients with drug refractory atrial fibrillation.\n\nAfter the human heart is normal, the upper heart, also known as the net 1, earthquake wave is from the  net1 of only one, ie., Without stimulation of the right atrium, the electrophysiological wave gradually falls. If the electrophysiological wave is abnormally elevated, the activities of the upper and lower atria are abnormal. If the electrophysiological wave electrode with trust, apply the patient to the right atrium, the right atrium or both upper chamber, defend these sites is used as many called the \u201csnowflakes tattooing\u201d, \u201csnowflakes\u201d, this place with 3-5mm diameter, is an radiofrequency ablation in the past works for ablation heart surgery.

The left ventricular hole caused by the ablation of atrial fibrillation can be recovered?\n\nIn order to protect the safety of patients during ablation treatment, what is the safety of ablation? What kind of things that doctors need to mention before ablation, the difference between atrial ablation and ventricular ablation?\n\nThe success rate of atrial ablation varies according to different data and the classification of patients from all over the world: In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the 1-year success rate is as high as 90%-95%, the 6-year success is about 75%-85%, and the 9-year follow-up data demonstrated that it has a long-term effect in more than 60% of treated patients.\n\nFor patients with persistent atrial fibrillation or permanent atrial fibrillation, the short-term success rate is about 60%-68% and the long-term success rate is about 50%-60%.\n\nAt present, the success rate of atrial ablation for treating patients with long-term ventricular tachycardia is about 80%-90%. However, long-term ventricular arrhythmia is less common than atrial fibrillation, accounting for less than 20% of all types of tachycardia, so the treatment of arrhythmia disease is still dominated by atrial ablation.\n\nCompared with drug therapy, the success rate of atrial ablation under local anesthesia and intracardiac echocardiography in China is generally higher than that of Western countries, and the success rate is close to 90% in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but it is much lower in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, and the success rate of long-term ventricular tachycardia ablation treatment is lower.Especially for patients with wide QRS, the success rate of ablation treatment is low, and there are some local cases of difficult to surgical treatment.\n\n## Can arrhythmia (arrhythmia) recur after ablation?\n\nIn addition to a minority of patients, the longer the disease lasted, the lower the success rate,", "During catheterization procedures, the local anesthetic affects only the area where the catheter is located. Some patients do not feel heat or electrical stimulation, especially if there is confusion, anxiety, or sedation. You can ask him to count from 1 to 100 to be able to perceive the sensations of the procedure, for example.\n\nThe procedure is similar to the MRI scan. The only disadvantage is that the procedure must be stopped and started again each time the patient must get out of the body.\n\nOnce the heart is over, it is relieved into the neck.\n\nDoctor's advice.

Let\u2019s learn more about arrhythmia, ablation, and many more.\n\n## I. Atrial arrhythmia\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia. AF usually starts from the right atrium of the heart. AF may cause rapid, irregular, and chaotic heartbeats. The message of activation of the ventricles is lost and causes the ventricles not to beat as normal. Hospitals perform many tests such as ECG, Holter test, stress test, etc. to diagnose Atrial fibrillation.\n\nAF has various warning signs and symptoms include palpitations, tiredness, chest pain, dizziness/fainting, shortness of breath, etc. Many people may not be aware that they have AF. Some people with AF have seen their heart rates minimize, likewise, some may see it increase. Overall the heart rate of AF normally is higher than normal.\n\n### AF Indicators of other diseases\n\nRisk factors comprise heart disorders such as hypertension, heart disease, heart failure, mitral valve disorder, pericarditis, rheumatic fever, etc. and are at higher risk of developing AF than others.\n\nStroke/TIA, memory loss, People with arrhythmia are at a greater risk of stroke/TIA. Stroke and TIA more often than not make difficulties in memory, thinking and concentration.\n\nDeath According to a study, people with AF showed three times bigger odds of dying than other patients overall.\n\n## II. Heart ablation\n\nWhat is cardiac ablation? Cardiac ablation is a highly universal and highly successful medical procedure offered at SanaKare Hospital to recognise and treat abnormal heart murmurs that result in poor heart health resorting to AF.\n\nThere is often a few heart murmurs in the heart\u2019s pathways that direct a normal heartbeat but somehow the pathways become abnormal and direct the rhythm of the heart so that it makes an unsafe pathway, as a result, AF develop within the individual. Cardiac ablation fixes the abnormal pathways with the help of anti-inflammatory drugs. It is the most heartwarming treatment of arrhythmia.\n\nHow to get heart ablation?

In addition to the many positive effects on fitness levels and muscular strength, improving cardiovascular fitness can help normalize blood pressure and regulate certain hormones and other chemicals in the blood, both of which can reduce undue strain on neurotransmitter flow in the brain and allow neurons to function at a more normal level. In fact cardiovascular exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on brain functioning in general with regard to learning and memory.\n\nOther types of exercise can help prevent falls, such as tai chi, which places emphasis on a gentle postural awareness that allows participants to build confidence in their abilities as they go through the movements involved in the program, while improving their balance. Yoga is also a low-impact exercise that can help improves balance. See the WebMD fact sheet on Yoga Exercises for Good Health for a complete description of the exercise.\n\nYou can find a joint care program that will help you manage NPH by Partners in Exercise for Osteoarthritis (PEOA). It includes a 10-week, tailored exercise program aimed at reducing pain, improving function, and increasing physical activity levels, along with behavioral advice on positive lifestyle changes.\n\nAerobic exercise has been shown to be particularly effective in combating fatigue. One study conducted in Italy suggests that weekday aerobic exercise is more effective than weekend exercise for boosting energy in patients with NPH.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise for older adults, defined as brisk walking (approx. 3 MPH), riding a bike on level ground or with few hills, water aerobics, swimming laps, playing doubles tennis or light gardening for 50 to 60 minutes most days of the week.\n\nStretching increases freedom of movement and ability to exercise, which can reduce the risk of developing frailty and chronic diseases associated with it, such as NPH. It also helps improve balance, increases the coordination of muscles and joints, helps prevent falls, and reduces feelings of fatigue.\n\nIf there are no support groups in your area, you can consider joining an online support group such as NPH \u2013 Neurosyph Support Groups Inc, which is moderated and offers advice and discussion", "Exercise is an excellent way for people of all ages to get enough physical activity, improve general health, maintain bone density, lower risk for heart disease, and much more.

If you plan on starting an activity a doctor of osteopathy can perform or refer you for a VO2 max, an exercise tolerance test to find out what level you start from and determine what types of activities you can get involved in.\n\nI would think swimming one of the activities you should be able to participate in; being the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can wash in and out of the shunt, proper positioning of the valve, and lowering the amount of air bubbles can reduce the risk of any build up which can produce headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and temporary vision issues. Certainly best the shunt was placed with this degree of thinking in mind.\n\nIn the active stage, do not have any upper body activities that could lead to a dramatic rise in blood pressure.\n\nExercise should certainly be relaxing.

Lemtrada proved to be the best intensive approach for me, just as regular planned-on breakthrough naltrexone troundulation was a shabby replacement for weekly psychotherapy but I\u2019m not where I was last month, so downturnulating was the right choice and likely the one that will get psychiatrists to fuss over a patient more and accept naltrexone more often to treat depression as well as RP.\n\n1A CatFalcon flew over a cactus patch to examine the details: Can naltrexone be used to treat severe depression in someone who has been stable on naltrexone and cymbalta?", "James Gordon, a patient with severe depression that impaired his life, went down a path of personally investigating and experimenting with forms of cannabis to help manage his depression and, more specifically, LDN.

In the late 1980s, Bihari successfully pioneered the concept of artificial remissions, harnessing the power of certain brain-based deliverables to temporarily turn back tumor growth. While his initial focus was not on depression, his extensive research on the delivery of small doses of naltrexone to enzyme deficient lymphocytes within the immune system has led to an unpublished, but dictionary-sized, scientific envelope of information on the numerous health benefits provided by consuming very low doses of this opiate antagonist.\n\nIn fact, I would submit to you that Dr. Bihari's discoveries have served to give birth to a whole new class of pharmaceutical and biofeedback well-being measures whose usage is capable of addressing a remarkable number of health maladies. Using ultra-low doses of naltrexone as a catalyst for supplying your body with naturally occurring stimuli capable of promoting healing has, is, and will continue to involve all of us in a more important conversation during our lifetime here on earth.

Hepatitis A usually causes no symptoms or mild symptoms. Hepatitis B and C can cause fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n\nHow is hepatitis diagnosed?\n\nHepatitis is diagnosed through a blood test.\n\nHow is hepatitis treated?\n\nThere is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Hepatitis B and C can be treated with antiviral medications.\n\nHow can hepatitis be prevented?\n\nHepatitis A can be prevented by washing your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom, and by avoiding contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B can be prevented by getting vaccinated. Hepatitis C can be prevented by avoiding sharing needles or other sharp objects.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for hepatitis?\n\nThe prognosis for hepatitis varies depending on the type of hepatitis and the severity of the infection.

If possible, wait three days before cleaning the surface. After cleaning, thoroughly rinse the surface with water and dry the surface with a clean cloth or paper towel. Allow surfaces to dry before using them again. Because bleach breaks down rapidly, always use bleach that has not been opened for more than a few months.\n\nYou can also disinfect surfaces with hydrogen peroxide, alcohol or detergents containing phenol. There are many other alternative cleaning products.\n\nWhat should I know if my HIV status is unknown?\n\nMost medical, behavioral and other health risk factors do not increase the risk of transmission. One notable exception is having HIV. Certain treatments to reduce hepatitis treatment are contraindicated in these situations, and it is also recommended that the precautions described above be taken by healthcare workers. Please refer to the WHO protocols for patients with HIV.\n\nWhat is the difference between HIV and hepatitis B/C?\n\nObviously, there is much room for opinion depending on the situation, but the general consensus seems to be that some form of inhibition is called for, primarily because exposure to and subsequent transmission of Hepatitis B are much more likely. to lead to AID, even if the universal precautions described above are followed.\n\nPersons who have recently received a blood transfusion are generally not considered infectious for at least 7 days after the transfusion.

Following the hospital stay, the child has to be treated at home for about 6 months. It is important to use drugs. Sometimes a spoiler is found in the anal area. Warfarin drops, containing the active principle warfaralfona, are used to remove the warts. They are a homeopathic proven benefit. Urological irrigation and plastering is the next phase of this disease. During the latter phase, for example, when the wound closes, the child should undergo regular physiotherapeutic exercises like swimming, and pain massages should be administered. Sometimes the scar that remains in the affected joint is mobile and sometimes immobilized, but there is a remedy that is used in homeopathy it is andrographis paniculata. There are cases where the polio has a strong tendency to return in the patient's later years, and in such cases the treatment must strictly adhere to the pathogenesis details given in homeopathy.

Moisture in warm weather is obvious, but you can end up with scrotum yeast infection in cool weather as well if you sweat a lot. These conditions should be evaluated and treated promptly.\n- Scrotum Yeast Infection is commonly found on the foreskin or the glans (head) of the penis. It is increasing in incidence because of sexual activity, poor hygiene at puberty and overgrown hair on the scrotum. There can be some severe irritation & itching, particularly before and after intercourse. It is treated with gentle soap & water and then a smear of special cream just over the affected site.\n- Depending on the interest & the symptoms in the scrotal area, a physician can borrow suitable from yeast infection checks and determine if treatment is necessary.\n\nCouldn\u2019t\u2026.

These symptoms can also be associated with pinworms, crabs, chaffing, and friction. Changing underwear frequently, using talcum powder, and using baby wipes on the scrotum can lead to these symptoms.\n\nThe size of these lumps depends on what type they are. Genital herpes can produce lesions that are less than a half inch in diameter and are known as skin tags. Molluscum Contagiosum, molluscum, are skin growths that can cause lumps in most men. These lesions can be mistaken for a cyst, and your doctor should be consulted if you are unsure what they are.\n\nChanges in underwear, such as wearing tighter-fitting underwear, may be a primary cause of these lumps. Sports underwear, spandex boxers, and other bodywear that are tight-fitting can increase the temperature in the genital region and cause swelling. Wearing loose-fitting underwear can prevent the formation of pimples. Drinking lots of water, using mild soap, and avoiding deodorant and antiperspirants are other ways to prevent this condition.\n\n## How do you know if lumps on scrotum are normal?\n\nSmall lumps around the scrotum are a common problem. While these lumps may be smaller than other lumps, they are usually visible. They are caused by increased air pressure or trapped gas. However, wearing clothing that fits tightly can make them more noticeable. A doctor can provide an exact diagnosis and a treatment plan. Among other common causes of lumps are enlarged lymph nodes, genital herpes, and trapped air.\n\nTumors or lesions may arise near the anus and rectum and be painful when bearing down, used the bathroom, or resting.

How do I get rid of these ugly lumps?\n\nJock Itch is a fungal infection caused by a parasite mainly produced from the fungus Candida Albicans, a member of the yeast family. But Jock itch is really an infection of the skin; and while it is most common in men, any hot, humid environments or ones where friction is constant such as the skin and cloth area might be subjected to in underwear or long pants makes this infection common in both men and women.\n\nHomeopathic remedies are recommended for the relief and often the clearance of Jock Itch. Small internal lumps are possibly the signs of a severe case of Jock Itch that has set into the area, or lymph nodes are possibly healthy and capable of expressing the waste products in the area.\n\nSince you have not mentioned if the lumps hurt and their size and color, it is hard to assess whether they are the result of Jock Itch infection.

The rib cage is a complex structure that protects the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. It is made up of 12 pairs of ribs, which are connected to the spine and sternum. The ribs are attached to the spine by muscles and ligaments, which help to stabilize the rib cage and protect the organs inside.\n\nThere are many different causes of rib cage pain, but the most common is trauma to the ribs. This can occur during a car accident, when the ribs are compressed or fractured. Other causes of rib cage pain include muscle strain, inflammation, and infection.\n\nIf you are experiencing rib cage pain, it is important to see a doctor to determine the cause.

The most likely the first of these being the common flu or a virus infection. The second most common is from cough which damages the lung tissue that also damages the ribs.\n\nCommon Pain and Rib Cage Pain\n\nThe causes appear to be viral respiratory infections, perhaps, the common cold. This causes a choking and coughing response that becomes habit forming in some patients. A virus can result in chronic bronchial infection and cough which can be exacerbated by smoking.\n\nThe more serious the infection, the less the pain; for example, a person with a severe sore throat or who coughs regularly may not feel the rib cage pain as it becomes numbed and desensitized. The cough therefore goes undiagnosed. It also takes time for the muscles of the thorax to heal after a minor bruise and you may be tempted to check if you have pain or not before trying the moves I described earlier.\n\nSmoking, lack of lung oxygen, or acid reflux (heartburn) may likewise cause rib cage pain. Pain from chronic medical conditions is usually checked by a painful consultation. This is a form of neurological examination. There is a procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nThis MRI examination will indicate any rib cage problems.\n\nChronic muscle spasms most commonly occur after fracturing of the rib cage and/or a dislocated rib. However, a soft tissue tumour or lung cancer may cause rib cage pain as well.\n\nRib Tumor\n\nOften this pain is quite severe, even with no signs or symptoms, but does not limit mobility and is not always associated with any secondary symptoms. A pain that is justifiable is called \u201creflex\u201d and is related to the axis point of the joints, which are in turn related to the way the joints actually move.\n\nIt was expected that the pain would progress to spread to other joints and there may be symptoms of discomfort, burning, or tingling in some part of the body. What may be surprising is that there are areas of the body that do not have symptoms of pain or discomfort.\n\nSome of these body parts are known as the chiropractic vertebrae.

Keep on reading to find out.\n\n## What Is Rib Cage Pain?\n\nRib cage pain is the feeling or sensation of pain being felt in the area between one\u2019s backbone or spinal column and the belly. We are different in terms of the levels of pain that we feel when it comes to pain.\n\nHowever, the medical term used to calculate an individual\u2019s pain rate is the \u201cpain scale.\u201d The pain scale measures pain based on a range from 1 to 10. 1 stands for the minimum pain rate (which is usually soothing and bearable, while 10 usually is the average pain rate for anyone suffering from a given disease or experience). The pain being felt by one\u2019s rib cage happens when the patient/afflicted individual feels the onset of severe pain in the intercostal space (which literally translates to between the ribs/inside of the rib spaces). Rib cage pain can either be dull or intermittent in nature. Dull rib cage pain means that the individual usually feels a dull or almost continuous pain, while intermittent rib cage pain is only experienced when the situation calls for it, or when the individual is having one sort of activity at a certain period.\n\n> What are the causes of rib cage pain? How is rib cage pain given remedy on the spot? For what conditions can rib cage pain be regarded as a symptom?\n\n## Causes\n\n### Rib Cage Pain Caused by Conditions and Diseases\n\nThere are a number of conditions and diseases that can lead to the onset of rib cage pain being felt by one. The following are such conditions and diseases that are most, if not all of the time, the cause of the pain in the intercostal space/inside the rib spaces:\n\n- Pleuritis. This condition and disease happens when the lining of the lungs (pleura) gets enlarged or is irritated by the presence of bacteria or germs. This condition is also considered an \u201cinflammatory\u201d condition and disease as it causes the interference of some vital body parts such as the lungs and the neighboring organs.\n- Pneumothorax. This disease and condition can be described as the influx of air tissues between the pleura (the lining of the lungs) and the lungs. This is one of the causes of dys", "As respiratory specialists, it\u2019s vital that we fully understand the different causes of rib pain, how to evaluate and treat it, and when to refer it for further professional care. To differentiate between multiple rib pain diagnosis options, we need all the tools to do so. Here are some common conditions you might face when treating rib pain.\n\n## 1. Costochondritis\n\nCostochondritis is an inflammation or irritation of the cartilaginous join between the rib and chest wall. Costochondritis usually refers to more than one costal cartilage being affected. It is also referred to as \u201ccostochondral syndrome\u201d by some medical specialists. There are two types of costochondritis \u2013 idiopathic and secondary.\n\n- Idiopathic costochondritis \u2013 The cause of this type is unknown, but sometimes an injury may precede its occurrence, although this is not thought to be related.\n- Secondary costochondritis \u2013 In addition to the idiopathic type already discussed, can be caused by a traumatic injury of any sort to the chest. Fatigue, hard coughing, physical exercise, or constant chest movement, such as from working on a cash register, may also cause this type of costochondritis to develop.\n\nThis condition occurs most often in people between the age of thirty-five to fifty-five. At least one-third of all patients with pain at the costo-sternal joint will have at least one false-positive result for a cardiac evaluation. Doctors usually do a cardiac workup. In most cases, complete healing of costochondritis is obtained within a few weeks to months with NSAIDs and rest.\n\nUsing MRI with breath holds, Social Security attorneys can prove the real nature of this condition in disability cases. MRI should never be done during inhalation or suspension.\n\n## 2. Costotransverse arthropathy (Merchant\u2019s disease)\n\nThis is an inflammatory arthritic condition, and it can affect the costotransverse joint, the joint between the rib and the upper part of the spine known as the transverse process of the thoracic vertebra.\n\nThis disorder tends to affect the seventh and eighth costotransverse joints that", "Lots of people experience musculoskeletal pain or discomfort in the chest region. It may be located between the ribs. It maybe the lower chest (lateral). Or it can be the central or middle of the chest near the sternum. So let's look at the structures which may cause this. We look at the muscles, ribs, nerve and skin as well as some internal organs.\n\n## Rib-Cage Muscles\n\nThere are many muscles in the chest region. Look at the diagram below. Structures appear in dark grey.\n\nThe big muscles which may be involved if there is difficulty or pain in breathing are the external intercostals which are intimate with the cartilage of the ribs and the diaphragm. The internal intercostals which are actually closer to the pleura inside the rib cage.\n\n## Ribs and Intercostal Se Pain I return to top of page\n\nNext to the muscles is the lungs contained by the rib cage. Between each pair of ribs lies a space which contains the muscle, the rib articulation and the intercostal nerve. In this space is the lungs. Therefore if any of these structures are affected or restricted in it's function, the intercostal nerve can be affected.\n\nDeformity of the rib cage or shoulders can also cause disruption of the nerves. The outward movement of the chest wall with each breath can be very effective in massaging the lungs which are usually circulating with a material containing debris or foreign particles which can block the blood capillaries in the lung tissue causing discomfort. However the massaging movement may put strain on some of the rib cage muscles and can cause the lungs to herniate. You may be aware that you have lost skin from your arms due to muscle wastage from lack activity. Exercise is also important in the chest.\n\nHomework: Try lying on your chest (the psychiatrist position) and rotate your shoulders back and forth. Besides the lungs and the rib/chest you will also be exercising the upper back and the mid and low back. Therefore we need to strengthen the whole body to remedy the intercostal nerve pain.\n\n## Nerves\n\nBetween each pair of ribs is the intercostal nerve which contains sensory and motor fibres.The 4th pair gives off sensory branches into the breast.

Infection with hantavirus also causes a lung \u201cfluid sickness\u201d disease known as Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, or HPS. The disease can cause pulmonary oedema of severe and can even be fatal in humans, caused by abrupt flooding of fluid\n\nWhat is a virus? A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.\n\nHow are hantavirus pand", "Hantavirus is a virus which causes a serious disease in humans.\n\nTransmission: Hantavirus is usually spread from rodents (Rats) through their droppings and urine. When these droppings and urine that contain Hantavirus get dry they scatter around and can affect the humans living in that area as well as the people who inhale it in the form of air borne particles. When a rat get dried pop out droppings or urine too.\n\nHantavirus is not spread by the rat\u2019s blood. It has not been reported to infect humans by being bitten or simply by any accidental contact with a rodent.\n\nSymptoms: Hantavirus usually takes 1 to 6 weeks to show its symptoms. It will affect the lungs and kidneys of humans that cause severe breathing problems, lack of urine, low blood pressure, stomach pain, vomiting and muscle pain.\n\nFever, aches, chills, headache and pain in the joints are usually the early signs of this disease. However, as compared to several other diseases, hantavirus has 2 serious types:\n\nHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: HFRS is not fatal condition of hantavirus. It spreads at a faster rates and often affects people during the fall and winter months. This type of hantavirus affects the kidneys. The patient of HFRS become dehydrated and could become unconscious if not treated properly and quickly. The most dreaded symptom of HFRS is extreme thirst.\n\nHantavirus pulmonary syndrome: HPS is a deadly disease in which lungs are infected badly. It is a rare disease which was first recognized in 1993. It could start with the mild illness of fever. Later the symptoms are transmitted to the lungs, causing pulmonary illness, respiratory failure, difficulty in breathing, pulmonary edema (fluid fills lungs), and then becomes a fatal disease for humans.\n\nDiagnosis: How to confirm Hantavirus disease? Blood test could confirm HFRS disease if samples of the blood are taken within the first two weeks of the onset of the Hantavirus disease. You will have your HFRS disease confirmed if IgM antibodies are spotted in the blood sample.\n\nHemagglutination/EAR test can", "Hantavirus is a disease that is spread by mice, rats and scratches. for 1.5 months in the wet spring, the potential for outbreak of this disease will be amplified.\n\n## Hantavirus disease seems to be back this year\n\nRecent impressive outbreaks of hantavirus have killed dozens of South Korean people. A virus is lethal and can spread at a temperature of about 40 degrees Celsius to 47 degrees Celsius.\n\nPeriods in spring and summer are the most distinct. This year there are several typical cases of Hanta fever in South Korea, with the number of patients reaching a maximum.\n\nSymptoms due to hantavirus are very similar to flu fever, such as symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, bluish lips, difficulty breathing, etc. If left untreated, things can develop worse, with low blood volume or bleeding in various tissues in the body. Hantavirus is rarely fatal. However, losing a little blood severely enough or failing to try a respirator in a timely manner, this will lead to death of the patient.\n\nHantavirus is not situated on the nipple infection or run with blood, but through contact with the pathogen daily, the potential to spread in the house is undeniable.\n\nPeriodic outbreaks of hantavirus can be done by mice or rats, their urine, feces. Hence, leads to continuous contact with small rodents, you often have in the house, especially if you do not clean regularly, if you bring dried, wet food. Those with bio flakes, for example, over time there is an increased potential for infection with hantavirus.\n\nThe preliminary period of 1.5 months, that is the most impressive to the virus is that these rodents are more willing to go out in search of food, stumbling through the house, they reach more living space.\n\nRight in the winter, rodents will live a considerable period of time hidden in nests, which can lead to the difficulty of controlling them, from 1.5 months. Later, these rats will start to overload the area, leading to the rats\u2019 travel space is interrupted. Then the mice or rats dogs must look for other feeding space.\n\nThese are little animals that are really annoying because they can travel, hide", "Hantavirus in pets is the same virus that causes Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in humans.\n\nBelieve it or not, it is possible for pets to contract hantavirus.\n\nAnimals such as deer mice and mammals can shed tons of the virus through their saliva and urine.\n\nBut over 300 different types of hantavirus have already been discovered. Hantavirus in pets is most likely pandemic throughout all continents (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia).\n\nThe good news is hantavirus in pets is not very common.\n\nThe chance of your dog or cat contracting hantavirus is very low. Compared to humans, the risk is estimated 1 in 5 million.\n\nThere have only been about 472 confirmed cases since 1993 with a FATALITY RATE of 35% \u2013 SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER than in animals.\n\nIf your cat or dog does become infected, hantavirus could be life threatening! But it is not typically a fatal virus if caught in time. Any mammal can end up infected.\n\nThe issue is, once you develop HPS symptoms and seek treatment, it could be rapidly becoming more fatal.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to learn as much as possible about this disease and know what the symptoms are!\n\n## 4 Steps to Prevent Hantavirus in Pets!\n\nThere is no specific medication or vaccine against this virus. The only thing catching a virus that is widespread and has a high fatality rate. It\u2019s best to keep your pet clean and away from areas that have a lot of mice activity. A few ways are:\n\n- Keep Litter Box Sanitized and Clean\n- Don\u2019t Blow Leaves Onto the Yard\n- Keep Walking Your Dogs in Well-Groomed Areas\n- Don\u2019t Feed Ducks\n- Keep Your Home Clean of Mice\n\nDogs and cats usually help a dead animal remove pathogens lying around. They run around in the area that potentially expose your dogs and cats to hantavirus particles.\n\n### What Is Hantavirus? | Symptoms & Treatment Today!\n\nThe hantavirus family of viruses are widespread in rodents can occupy or"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1944, "rouge1_r": 0.0204, "rouge1_f1": 0.0369, "rouge2_p": 0.0571, "rouge2_r": 0.0058, "rouge2_f1": 0.0106, "rougel_p": 0.1944, "rougel_r": 0.0204, "rougel_f1": 0.0369, "bleurt": 0.4038, "bert_score_p": 0.7364, "bert_score_r": 0.8279, "bert_score_f1": 0.7795, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3611, "rouge1_r": 0.0355, "rouge1_f1": 0.0647, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.2222, "rougel_r": 0.0219, "rougel_f1": 0.0398, "bleurt": 0.2316, "bert_score_p": 0.7817, "bert_score_r": 0.8589, "bert_score_f1": 0.8185, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.0537, "rouge1_f1": 0.097, "rouge2_p": 0.0286, "rouge2_r": 0.003, "rouge2_f1": 0.0054, "rougel_p": 0.3889, "rougel_r": 0.0418, "rougel_f1": 0.0755, "bleurt": 0.3532, "bert_score_p": 0.7805, "bert_score_r": 0.8518, "bert_score_f1": 0.8146, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5556, "rouge1_r": 0.0585, "rouge1_f1": 0.1058, "rouge2_p": 0.1714, "rouge2_r": 0.0176, "rouge2_f1": 0.0319, "rougel_p": 0.4167, "rougel_r": 0.0439, "rougel_f1": 0.0794, "bleurt": 0.3764, "bert_score_p": 0.7892, "bert_score_r": 0.8615, "bert_score_f1": 0.8237, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5556, "rouge1_r": 0.0549, "rouge1_f1": 0.1, "rouge2_p": 0.1429, "rouge2_r": 0.0138, "rouge2_f1": 0.0251, "rougel_p": 0.3611, "rougel_r": 0.0357, "rougel_f1": 0.065, "bleurt": 0.3178, "bert_score_p": 0.7911, "bert_score_r": 0.8579, "bert_score_f1": 0.8232, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4722, "rouge1_r": 0.0518, "rouge1_f1": 0.0934, "rouge2_p": 0.0571, "rouge2_r": 0.0061, "rouge2_f1": 0.011, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.0366, "rougel_f1": 0.0659, "bleurt": 0.2712, "bert_score_p": 0.7815, "bert_score_r": 0.8589, "bert_score_f1": 0.8184, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}]}

Many factors influence the fever, such as age and general health of the child, if the appendix has actually ruptured or not, and if there is much fluid in the abdomen that doesn't actually show a fever versus a fever that responds to treatment that shows fluid is not being absorbed the right way. If the appendix has ruptured the fever is likely to be high unless the child\u2019s immune system is very low or the child is very dehydrated.\" - Dr. Farzad Manbi\n\nWhat is a ruptured appendix and how do you know if its ruptured?\n\n\"If the appendix ruptures, it can leak out pus from the area where the infection is into the abdominal cavity. The body responds by switching on its own natural immune system, and tries to wall off this extra fluid into a part of the abdomen that might be very loose, or just barely connected to other abdominal organs so that there is less chance of a large infection for those organs. Our bodies are very complicated. When we understand a little bit more of what the body does to fight off an infection, that erases many of the myths about what to do to treat appendicitis.\n\nIsn\u2019t ketchup supposed to be good for you?\n\n\"The research only shows it when used frequently.

The cause of appendicitis is unknown.\n\nIn acute appendicitis, there are usually few constitutional symptoms and an abnormal hydrosoluble sediment is rarely found in the stool, except in atypical cases.\n\nThe acute abdomen may be due to the involvement of a single or multiple viscus or it may be related to special situations such as bowel obstruction, infarction, volvolus , hernia, vascular causes, and neoplasm.\n\n## What is appendicitis?\n\nAppendicitis is a classic example of inflammatory diarrhea with an abnormal hydrosoluble sediment due to intestinal infections, including salmonella and hookworm infections.\n\nThe acute abdomen is characterized by our neck with several corresponding pain symptoms, including acute, severe, throbbing, periumbilical pain followed by localized pain in the lower right abdomen, three to four hours after the initial pain. The pain becomes sharp when tensed by cough or competition. Pyrexia is usually present but not essential.\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nThe clinical development of appendicitis is characterized by periumbilical pain followed by pain in any of the characteristic areas (McBurney's point, Petit s point, The right hypochondrium, umbilical region, the lower quadrant).\n\nAfter each stage, the patient develops one or more of the following symptoms which are characteristic of appendicitis.\n\nConstipation and or diarrhea.\n\nPatients with disorders of defecation generally point to the normal coating of the stool as a cause of diarrhea induced by the disease.\n\nThis is normal in the first stage of appendicitis.

In addition, the patient will also experience chills.\n\nSuccessive vomiting: After the initial nausea, the patient will begin to vomit", "Appendicitis tends to be associated with symptoms of chills called rigors, abdomen pain and elevated temperature. Appendicitis is a disorder common in adults and children that affects the appendix, one of the glands placed near the lower part of the abdomen. It is caused lately by a microbial virus, which speeds up the development of the glandulus. Causes of painThe appendix is an organ that can cause pain problems when inflamed. The pain suggests the location of the appendix, usually causing pain at the right-side of the waist (near it is located the appendix) and in the lower quadrant of the abdomen. Characteristically it is specified in certain diseases in which the intensity of the pain has a different form than that caused by abdominal pain.\n\nAs appendicitis can also undergo a perforation, serious consequences may occur, such as peritonitis and abscess of the abdominal cavity. It has several causes, being thus usually included in the list of the most common diseases.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAppendicitis is a disease that is characterised by sudden abdominal pain. The disease is often misdiagnosed, especially in children, and the diagnosis should be made very quickly in order to avoid perforation of the appendix. Abdominopelvic pain in children should be investigated carefully as it is more common than in adults for a patient with appendicitis. Furthermore, some patients do not have the classic symptoms of acute appendicitis, including acute abdominal pain or pain around the gut area at the time of diagnosis.\nSymptoms of acute appendicitis vary depending on the clinical cause. Appendicitis is a disease characterised by inflammation of the appendix. Appendix is an anatomical part located in the right lower quadrant of the abdominal wall. This anatomical organisation of the colon is very similar in the structure of the vertebral column and it measures approximately 2.5Km. In addition to the function of protecting the abdominal wall, appendicitis can also cause inflammation of the colon.\n\nCommon symptoms of acute appendicitis\n\nPressure, warmth and redness on the part of the body called cancer (near the right lower quadrant of the abdomen in its deeper part) or around the appendix", "The bottom line: Right from the very beginning of my schooling in medicine, I was taught that it is always important to search for the cause of a fever in any patient. It is the fever per se that is not important, but knowing why a CASE of fever is present is the key to good medical care.\n\nAnd so there are presently nearly as many reasons to have a fever as there are pathologic and physiologic disorders, since such features are present in leptospirosis, herpes zoster to mention only 3 common causes, to mention none that are important, but uncommon.\n\nThe simple reason for a fever is elevated body temperature, a value that rises above 98.6F. This temperature is the result of altered POSTERIOR HYPOTHALAMIC neural activity, and signifies administration of chemical mediators such as interleukins, reactive oxygen molecules and other epiphenomena which can be present when the body is fighting an infection.\n\nIt need not always be present with every infection, but except in the very young, if, for instance, you are someone who has been exposed recently to an enteric infection, you may well have a higher than expected body temperature. Same goes for ischemia once you are old enough to appreciate those events more fully.\n\nShould I just ignore my appendicitis and wait until the pain settles down?\n\nNow the part that is even more interesting for me this weekend, is this question. It was first brought to my attention a long time ago by a colleague. How many times have I heard this since then \u2013 I am not right now sure? About a hundred times? A hundred fifty? A thousand? Who knows?\n\nThe response that I provided and continue to carry with me in my head follows the same roots:\n\nNo.\n\nThat is so typical of so many complainings I heard over the years.\n\nI am always overly delighted when my patients say to me, \u201cWell what I am supposed to do with that testimony? I mean, what I gotta take? Can you provide me something to feel better in about minutes?\u201d.\n\nBasically I used that info as a backup, a distinction that won\u2019t ever get me into trouble. So the reply I gave back was almost typical, and unmodified since then.\n\nSuppose I responded to both problems.", "Do you feel weird pangs of pain near your navel or elsewhere? Does it hurt terribly? If the answer is yes, call your doctor. You may be suffering from appendicitis.\n\n## Getting to the Bottom of It\n\nThere is no one sure-fire sign that can indicate you are suffering from appendicit\u2026 in . What many people mistake as symptoms of appendicitis are really something else. Then just how do we know if what you have is appendicitis or gallbladder disease? And what should be done in either case?\n\n## Symptoms\n\nThere are clues in the symptoms that differentiate the cause of this sudden abdominal pain. With appendicitis, the pain comes on quickly and then progresses as it moves to the right side of your abdominal wall. It may appear that if you move around you will be able to take your mind off the pain, but the only thing you achieve is to increase its intensity.\n\nNausea is common, as well as diarrhea or vomiting. A rigid (and hard) feeling in your abdomen is also usually diagnosed. If these symptoms continue untreated, so can the pain, which is usually described as the kind felt in pinching or a tightening of the abdominal muscles.\n\nWhat will your doctor do for you? A blood test will be administered. You may have to pass a stool sample, as well as urinalysis. Then X-rays or a CAT scan may be given. A rectal exam will also be completed with the help of an ultrasound. All of these diagnostic tests are aimed at identifying the problem and affording the correct therapy.\n\n## Treatment\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to keep the appendix from rupturing. This causes an infection which can spread to other organs, and can be very damaging to the body. This has to be taken very seriously: in the worst cases, mortality can result. Now whether surgery will be required depends upon whether you have already contracted a horrible bacterial disease. The more time the appendix has been ruptured, the more chance there is that bacterial disease will have moved to other areas of the body.\n\nRemember, a ruptured appendix must be removed as soon as possible.

The oxybutinin dosage you will see before taking lorazepam will vary. Generally it is between 5 and 10 mg per day. ps Ps, how does it work? It\u2019s not clear whether oxybutinin, or the whole body, does the oxybutinin dosage. It is most likely that if you are taking lorazepam and you will experience every adverse effects like dizziness, confusion, fatigue and/or tremors. I do not believe that oxybutinin or lorazepam will interfere with any medications or drugs. Lorazepam and gabapentin should not be taken together. Lorazepam works by binding to the receptors called dopamine D2 receptors.\n\n## What is the Transposition of the Common Iliac Artery in a Newborn?\n\nThe oxybutinin, on the other hand, does often not bind to the receptors because it binds to other receptors. The effects of oxybutinin and lorazepam may both be related to the effects it has on the kidney.

As a result, it may be given once a day, and if it is given in the morning it will not cause drowsiness. Instead, the best time for administration is at night when the patient has the most discomfort and the least ambulation.\n\nWhen oxybutinin was first on the market, physicians believed that urination was caused by contractions of the smooth muscle of the urinary bladder and that it could be treated by anti-smooth muscle drugs. However, it has now been found that oxybutinin has only a weak effect on the smooth muscle in the bladder. Nevertheless, the drug is effective for relieving dysuria in older males due to neurological and endocrinological malfunctions (which affect the urinary apparatus in older men), and possibly those of urinary incontinence. Further research indicates that urine is not incompatible with oxybutinin because of its transient existence after taking it.\n\n## What are the adverse effects of Extended-Release Oxybutynin?\n\nThe following are potential adverse effects that may occur as a result of Oxybutinin ER use:\n\n- Nausea\n- Stomach pain or irritation\n- Skin rash\n- Peripheral Edema\n- Constipation\n- Vomiting\n- Dry mouth\n- Nocturia/polyuria\n- Headache.\n- Fatigue\n- Increased Intraocular Pressure\n- Diarrhoea\n- Eyelid oedema\n- Tinnitus\n- Ataxia\n- Sweating\n- Increased urinary retention\n- Confusion\n- Cerebrovascular accident\n- Decreased libido\n- Dry eyes\n- Insomnia\n- Fever\n- Peripheral oedema\n- Increased intraocular pressure\n- ECG abnormalities\n- Suicidal thought\n- Visual disturbances\n- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5417, "rouge1_r": 0.0807, "rouge1_f1": 0.1405, "rouge2_p": 0.1702, "rouge2_r": 0.0249, "rouge2_f1": 0.0435, "rougel_p": 0.5417, "rougel_r": 0.0807, "rougel_f1": 0.1405, "bleurt": 0.6493, "bert_score_p": 0.7815, "bert_score_r": 0.8487, "bert_score_f1": 0.8137, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4792, "rouge1_r": 0.0625, "rouge1_f1": 0.1106, "rouge2_p": 0.1277, "rouge2_r": 0.0163, "rouge2_f1": 0.029, "rougel_p": 0.375, "rougel_r": 0.0489, "rougel_f1": 0.0865, "bleurt": 0.323, "bert_score_p": 0.7851, "bert_score_r": 0.8783, "bert_score_f1": 0.8291, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4792, "rouge1_r": 0.0732, "rouge1_f1": 0.1271, "rouge2_p": 0.1064, "rouge2_r": 0.016, "rouge2_f1": 0.0278, "rougel_p": 0.25, "rougel_r": 0.0382, "rougel_f1": 0.0663, "bleurt": 0.2986, "bert_score_p": 0.7776, "bert_score_r": 0.8439, "bert_score_f1": 0.8094, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4583, "rouge1_r": 0.0661, "rouge1_f1": 0.1155, "rouge2_p": 0.0426, "rouge2_r": 0.006, "rouge2_f1": 0.0106, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.048, "rougel_f1": 0.084, "bleurt": 0.3357, "bert_score_p": 0.7717, "bert_score_r": 0.8473, "bert_score_f1": 0.8077, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5833, "rouge1_r": 0.0862, "rouge1_f1": 0.1501, "rouge2_p": 0.1489, "rouge2_r": 0.0216, "rouge2_f1": 0.0377, "rougel_p": 0.375, "rougel_r": 0.0554, "rougel_f1": 0.0965, "bleurt": 0.364, "bert_score_p": 0.7913, "bert_score_r": 0.8784, "bert_score_f1": 0.8326, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3125, "rouge1_r": 0.0558, "rouge1_f1": 0.0946, "rouge2_p": 0.0213, "rouge2_r": 0.0037, "rouge2_f1": 0.0063, "rougel_p": 0.2083, "rougel_r": 0.0372, "rougel_f1": 0.0631, "bleurt": 0.3029, "bert_score_p": 0.7643, "bert_score_r": 0.8447, "bert_score_f1": 0.8025, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

It is important to realize that there are multiple medical conditions associated with neuropathic pain. For example, as a result of chronic infections including shingles, damaged or compromised nerves can generate pain. These infections or compromises can also lead to functional disorders, such as brachial neuritis and myelopathy.\n\n### Symptoms and Management of Reflex Neuropathic Pain\n\nNeuropathic pain, also referred to as Phantom Pain or by the term, reflexive pain, describes shooting neuropathic pain and surgery often causes it. Methods for alleviating this type of pain are almost endless. It can range from topical ointments, which can be used on affected areas, to the administration of various painkillers as determined by the pain's severity.

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

If using ultrasound, the typical findings are recognized between 13 and 18 weeks gestational age.  There is a severe microcephaly (small head) with facial characteristics including microphthalmia (small eye) and a reduced interpupillary inner diameter (distance between the eyes) and there is omphalocele (protrusion of abdominal contents).  If there is suspicion of Patau syndrome, it is usually recommended that an amniocentesis or CVS be performed to confirm the genetic abnormality.\n\nIs trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and if so, how will it progress?\n\nPatau syndrome is static and there are no ancillary treatments known to improve the clinical symptoms of Patau syndrome.  There is no known reason to expect patient will deteriorate further, although some may decline from inability to ingest or process food orally. In addition, despite aggressive treatment, many children lose their life before they are 10 years of age.\n\nHow might a patient with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) function over time?\n\nIt is possible that patient with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) may function independently for some time and require only intermittent care.  It is unlikely that patient with trisomy 13 Patau syndrome show improvement in function or life expectancy.\n\nWhat are the limitations in functioning over time for patient with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)?\n\nLimited lifelong support is required for those with Patau syndrome in order to maximize their development and maximize the chances of reaching a functional level of independence.  There is limited literature on the average life expectancy of those with Patau syndrome.  It is known, however, that these children may thrive and lead relatively normal lives.", "Patau syndrome is a progressive disorder, affecting every one of the many body systems. As such, it is impossible for your child ever to achieve normal growth and development. However, it is important to realize that children with Patau syndrome do progress and grow. Each significant milestone \u2013 even if it\u2019s never the same for two children \u2013 is an accomplishment.\n\nSome of the common features of Patau syndrome include:\n\n- Sparse, sparse, and often curved eyelashes\n- Small eyebrows\n- An eye abnormality known as microphthalmia (underdevelopment of the eyeball), which may lead to blindness\n- Abnormal development of the morphology of the face\n\nSometimes children with Patau syndrome are born with excess amniotic fluid in the uterus. In these children, the heart is at risk of being compressed by the excessive fluid. If is managed late, the condition can result in hydrops and even death. An additional risk is prematurity. The child\u2019s lungs and other organs are not fully developed and, as a result of this, may not be able to function soon after birth, so that the infant needs mechanical ventilation in the NICU.\n\nHow are children diagnosed with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)?\n\nLet\u2019s see how this feared situation unfolds. For the time being, we will assume that both parents have embryos that are healthy (that is, without embryos). Both are screened for chromosomal abnormalities with an amniocentesis culture.\n\nScreening test: Tests that can detect more than one possible chromosomal problem are usually called screening tests; examples are maternal age, ultrasound examination, and serum screening. (Click here for information on nuchal translucency values \u200b\u200ban abnormality in pregnancy.)\n\nDetection test: A detection test is used after a positive screening test to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether or not the fetus (embryo) has a problem. In this case, a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was then performed to determine if the child had the suspected chromosomal abnormality. The doctor gets a sample of the placenta and sends it to the laboratory to culture (grow) the cells. It takes about two weeks for the", "What are the different symptoms between it and trisomy 18?\n\nIt is both progressive and non-progressive, depending on what we are referring to. The extra copy of chromosome 13 seems to cause a lot of problems instantly, can cause babies and fetuses to have microcephaly, heart defects, a cleft lip and cleft palate. Children with this chromosome represented problem, also already have the three copies of chromosome 18, so their progress may be much slower. For some parents, this may appear to be progressive because what we are comparing it to, is a chromosomally \u201cnormal baby,\u201d and then when they add all these other problems, it just appears to be progressive because of our expectations. They are not expected to live very long with this. But, it is also non-progressive.\n\nYou did say that it affects the person\u2019s mental health, so one of the differences would be, what would be the difference with trisomy 18?\n\nBabies with trisomy 18 usually have adult looks. They may have a very flat (non-distractible) face with a prominent brow, can have a tendency to be somewhat wider and less/smaller set eyes. They also tend not to move as much as babies with trisomy 13. There is not near as much body movement for trisomy 18. They sometimes don\u2019t even have the ability to suck, meaning they do not have a swallow reflex\u2014 they could be born never sucking, never swallowing. There is just a collapses of the facial nerve, so they cannot produce a nice, full cry. They have a distinctive cry.

Samuel, MD, PhD, FACP, FRCP\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nMr. Popa and colleagues wrote a Randomized Controlled Trial posting on MedRxiv (preprint server) in September 2021 demonstrating that adding quinine to seltzer water resulted in robust relief of leg cramps in the oropharyngeal dysphagia population.  Aside from a somewhat ponderously-written paper, the study was enrolled 37 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia whose mutinous legs had a grand mal uprising following dinner. One third (n=12) received quinine carbonate 325 mg OD in sparkly water, and two thirds (n=25) received kencaro in sparkly water. Treatments were compared using a 32 point FastLegs Leg Cramp Severity Scale for Two Many Legs With Swollen Legs Scale.  Patients were instructed to rate leg cramp severity on said scale prior to ingestion of treatment.  Results were statistically significant using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias ranking tool. Their conclusions, in journalist-speak, were that the quinine-in-seltzer combo (QUIS) improved leg cramp severity compared to kencaro-in-seltzer (KIS) in subjects with throbbing, stress vomiting.\n\nStunned by this media breakthrough, I purred in feline fashion, tucking my tail under my right hind leg, and began to lick my paws and furiously contemplating this groundbreaking data.

The bubbles in soda can cause the cramping pain to extend into your stomach. Of course, if you're cramping or have muscle spasms, you can drink a cold glass of pure water to relax the muscle cells, although it may not do much for the pain.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no such natural quinine-like compound available, so if you find that soda water helps your cramps, you may have a little stomach upset as well.\n\nMany people these days experience nighttime muscle cramps and most aren't sure of what they can do to prevent them. There's a wealth of information on the topic on the Internet. There's also a lot of hype, so I've culled some facts from these sites.\n\nAccording to the University of Maryland Medical Center:\n\n- The exact cause of muscle cramps is still unknown, but most health professionals believe they result from lack of a chemical called magnesium. The most popular theory is that magnesium is responsible for the transmission of nerve signals to muscles.\n- Other magnesium-related processes that can produce cramping include muscle energy production (ATP), the formation of calcium and the building up of histamine. Low levels of magnesium can increase nerve sensitivity to pain. In people with low levels of magnesium, only half as much magnesium in the blood as called for is necessary to induce a cramp than average levels of magnesium require.\n- A small study of 150 patients in a hospital found that half recovered without magnesium treatment, but half required magnesium. Of those who improved, more than half required another intravenous dose of magnesium. After their second dose, and the next two doses, there was a gradual increase in cases that did not recover with treatment. Positive results were most likely for toxins and least for vitamin B_{1}.\n- Minerals like magnesium tend to be absorbed in the upper part of the intestine, partly by food taken in, before it gets to the lower end. Most minerals are about equally well absorbed regardless of which position the body is in.

While they are not harmful to humans, they can cause allergies and skin irritation. If you have mites in your home, there are a few things you can do to get rid of them.\n\nThe first step is to identify the type of mite you have. There are many different types of mites, and each one requires a different treatment. Once you know what type of mite you have, you can begin to treat the problem.\n\nIf you have dust mites, the best way", "The primary treatment for human mites is to treat the skin infection.  Systemic antibiotics are often prescribed for mite infections for proper skin bacterial health. Antihistamines are often prescribed to treat mite bite hypersensitivity.\n\nMites are traditionally treated with various fungicidal treatments, including :\n\u2022 Chelated Zinc\n\u2022 Colloidal Silver\n\u2022 Sterilized/filtered honey with Manuka honey;\n\u2022 Peroxide;\n\u2022 Thymol\n\nAs I discussed last week, proper treatment and prevention of a mite infestation starts with food and herbal options.  Epsom salt baths, profuse perspiration or saunas are beneficial, but we are trying to prevent future infestations. Eliminating the insecticide 8-Phenoxyisobutyl caffeine helps food enter our blood stream unfiltered, and increases nutrient availability.  Raw and green foods are alkalising to the body, and are energising for your natural defence.  They contain trace minerals and other essential substances which deplete from your's and your pets' body during the day.\n\nEveryone should include a green, if not paleo-vegan ingredient in their diet. This includes grains, legumes and seeds, and even some nuts like almonds and macadamia nuts. Additionally, cruciferous greens are some of the best anti-mite foods. An example is broccoli. Red meat, eggs and dairy are mite inducers.  A good option for removal of all visible mites is a 2-3:1 ratio of fresh Extra Virgin Olive oil over sea salt on the surface of the body. It is much healthier for you than traditional pesticides esp last generations as we discussed.\n\nFor the treatment, you need to make sure all of your stray hairs are removed from bedding, carpets, furniture, pillows, cushions, mats, etc.  Regular vacuuming, steam cleaning, dry cleaning will eliminate Mites.\n\nFor treatment of your pets, you need to put 4-5 drops of pure Lavender essential oil on each pet per night on their back backs each night, or the blanket or area they sleep.\nIf there is anyMRSA or BARS (severe MR", "Some people are allergic to mite dust and tolerate low levels, while others will get a severe reaction to any exposure.

He became famous because of this, apparently there was a magazine article about it.\n\nBut again, I don\u2019t have any experience of dealing with mite infestations, so am just putting recent experiences and ideas in here in case they might help.", "I am currently applying prescription hydrocortisone to areas affected by this condition.

With regard to pillows and mattresses, after moving 20 km in search of one of the three futons sold at IKEA, my wife and I are wrapped in our sleeping bags with zippers. In my opinion, the key is not to have an 8-day allergy season, but to learn to limit background pollen, smoke, humidity, mold and dust mites.

Most industry standards call for water molecules and ions to have a net negative charge, meaning that in a typical ionized air treatment source there are more negative ions than there are positive ones. There are many claims made regarding the benefits of negative ions. Denittification, improved body performance, stronger immunity, detox, disinfection, anti-freeze, soil gentrification\u2014negative ions appear to have real life-changing effects. From a far, there is enough consistent information regarding the disinfecting properties of negative ions to conclude that they work, as has been proven by several carefully designed research studies\n\nMITES:\n\nIMPORTANT: Originally, mites evolved as predators, but when humans began to keep farm animals many types of mites began to live on the vermin. This is different from most mites, which tend to seek out a specific site as their permanent home. All vermin mites are capable of infesting humans when on the hunt for other vermin; and even when they have decided to live here have been known to move back into domestic animals in Europe.\n\nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus lives in the dust of homes; D. farinae is most frequently isolated from mattresses. This mite has developed into one of the typical examples of asthma-related allergy mites.\n\nTYPE: Parasite\n\nSYMPTOMS: Dust mite allergens cause an IgE-mediated immune reaction to release histamine. This can cause inflammation, congestion, and a runny nose. Asthma, conjunctivitis, ear infections, and rhinitis can also result. Skin rashes are common, especially in children. Dry, scaly skin with reddish blotches, small red bumps, and hives are common reactions. Some children experience itchiness in their ears and throat.\n\nHOW TO TREAT:\n\nParasite Strong Antibiotics Strong Antioxidants Electromagnetic Vibration Ionized water may even be droughted on the affected affected affected. Parasites perform best when nutrients are accessible. Eating like mites. Regular", "In most contact allergic diseases such as dermatographism, scabies infection has been considered highly congenital. Patients with scabies were infectious in the incubation period. In primary or acute scabies in children, the main distinguishing features are intense papules that have itching ### mostly distributed in the flexion surface, ### since so many infectious organisms have reached the skin area at the same time. Additional sites on the body are the lower back and the skin fold areas in the ultraviolet feet. In the early stages of the inflammatory dermatitis, the central part commonly merges into purplish pigments and proliferative infiltration or resting to sandpaper crepe crevices of the skin. So, Sandermine faced Darwin phenomena.\n\n### Primary and secondary scabies\n\nWhen this primary scabies infection progresses, body arisement increases and \"maternal\" element fruits begin to form. In simple cases, after 12 hours, the redness of the site may turn blue and may become shiny. In situations, the crust appears less than 4 days. In acute, the primary scabies infected adult populations as well as the child's scabies tends to be increased due to younger ages and further accumulation of hyper-sensitization to Deluxe's allergen increasing patterns. Secondaise scabies can ear prutr ** and ** redness and whitish lesions, especially in the back, buttocks and penis. In the elongation of the disease, which is often unnoticed in the early stage, chestnut-colored clusters are formed in the form of clutching fibers, juices and swelling above the fingers.\n\n### Ear infection is a danger.\n\nIn the elderly, scabies can easily progress to numerous unwounded folliculitis, thus causing serious anxiety. In this scabies infected people, proliferation of nitrile lesions may be imposed in the keratinized blisters of \"pora poros\". In ornamentation manufacturers, difficulties in identifying infectious, particularly hand and wrist or homemade scabies often results in slippage and a smile. Under these conditions I think that the infection and treatment procedure will be completed.

This week\u2019s Dr. Moma Sauce of Medicine dives deep into the wonderful and complex world of the interaction between alcohol and prescription medicines.\n\nDrugs on the menu\nThough it\u2019s hard to believe, wine and cheese have been part of dinners in France since Norman times. With a tradition like that it seems like food and drugs must have been on the same menu for just as long.\n\nTurns out, though, that in addition to the daily meal, of which wine is a regular part, there were also bitter herbs and spices \u2013 including curcuma, myrofolanum, cannabis, cinnabara, galbuna, pyrus gratus, plantax, and \u201cother spice,\u201d that doctors might prescribe.\n\nThat led Jean de Vignau (d. 1497), physician to Napol\u00e9on III, to observe that if there were no problems drinking wine at dinner, there were probably also no problems with those herbs at lunch, which clearly had different properties. With the possible exception of cannabis and curcuma, which probably causes more earnestness than joy during dinner anyways.\n\nHandling a Haiti tornado\nA different sort of dinner time problem was highlighted during the Hurricane Matthew devastation in Haiti:\n\nVolunteer doctors with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res reported one case, involving a 45-year-old who injured her thigh falling while drunk. Then, the next morning, she started bleeding profusely. These medics diagnosed her as \u201calcohol-induced thrombocytopathy.\u201d\n\nTheir literature review detects no other such reported cases of bleeding from heavy drinking \u201cin a context of major natural disaster.\u201d. While they had to act quickly with drastic restraint measures, the simplicity of the diagnosis and treatment provides a good example of a potentially life-threatening danger of alcohol interaction.\n\nTonsillectomy on the wine route?\nBeyond the wine, there have been many concerns about medicines when eating and drinking on \u201cThe Wine Route\u201d.

Also, be aware of certain medications that react poorly with any amount of alcohol ingested.\n\nOne example of this is blood pressure medication. Any drink (including wine) should not have any alcohol content whatsoever when you take this type of medication. Below is a list of other medications that are adversely affected by alcohol consumption. By taking such precautions, you can enjoy wine with your meal safely and responsibly.\n\nA few prescription medications that you should NOT take with wine:\n\n- Nexium, Pepcid AC, and similar medications for heartburn\n- Medications that are antibiotics and antifungal\n- Any high blood pressure medications\n- Anything with isoproterenol, needed to deal with conditions such as asthma\n- Any prescription drugs that deal with antidepressants\n- Medication against pain, such as norco, vicodin, narcotics\n- Anything to help those with seizures", "It\u2019s a silly question, intuitive for most.

If in a restaurant, ask for a salad instead of a carbohydrate-rich soup; objects that fill you up -: order a straightforward protein; could try a dessert made from fruit.

After this, there is nothing between you and a good taste.\n\nYou will see that quantity does not have much with desire between 3pm, when your attention starts to decline, and 6pm, when most of us have eaten our main meal for the day. Even gourmet treats like cheese clocks can correct this gap. Food has different effects on individuals, based on many variables, such as calories and salt content. Because many Americans already comply with unhealthy eating habits, healthy changes can be risky until you get used to it before the habit is so burdened that it interferes with their life long.

Some babies who experience a prolonged labor that those of us who previously enjoyed conjugal relations cannot see why a child would have a delayed birth or labors when the fact is that their mothers experienced longer and much more difficult labors. In order to understand what hypoglycemia is and learn more about its causes, it is important to know more about the glucose requirements of a developing fetus and the hypothalamic sympathetic control of blood sugar release.\nHealth Care Forum; Newborn screening: Now or never?MedpagesAnd where, they ask, is the resource for new parents to turn when they suspect their child has symptoms of hypoglycemia? The first line of defense is the pediatrician, who is very good at diagnosing these kinds of conditions and can get the family into pediatric specialists (and Hospitals in Boston and elsewhere have begun forming their own specific Center for Hypoglycemia or similar name, and I expect many of them to join forces in support of \u201cBaby First\u201d).\n\nAt this point, the pediatrician or the mother can breast-feed (breastmilk would be advantageous because it contains a hormone called insulin, which prevents the release of glucose into the bloodstream), or, time out: Baby should get KARO syrup or sugar water on rice cereal but should still have synthetic birth situations in the seed bank to treat any low blood glucose.\nWhile some of the more charming variations of the disease affect adults, the most serious cases are found in children. Behavioral problems that interfere with the pursuit of education, obesity and severe craniofacial malformations commonly result. Interestingly, this is also observed in adults with hypoglycemia, and some cases of hypoglycemia have been documented in soldier-athletes as well. Clearly, the diagnosis of Hypoglycemia can no longer be made simply by measuring sugar in the blood. Because about 9 lbs of blood is lost, mothers who experience bleeding into the cerebrum are often considered to", "^{1}\n\nHypoglycemia, also referred to as \u201cLow Blood Sugar\u201d is a metabolic disorder and is extremely common in babies, especially those born premature. This condition further develops if the baby is not given food by his or her mother for a prolonged period after birth.\n\nThe most common causes and symptoms of \u201cHypoglycemia\u201dafter birth is:\n\n- \u201cSmall for its gestational age.\u201d\n- \u201cIntrauterine Growth Retardation\n- \u201cInadequate nutrition\u201d due to either due to improper weaning, medical issues, lactation, or as a consequence of neonatal intensive care, medications, infection or sepsis.\n- Innie intubations resulting in stress and different administrative difficulties which hinder the natural outcomes of the healing process within the newborn child.\n\nNote from GP: The newborn infant develops the first blood sugar levels after birth. During the first few weeks after birth, milk is commercial drinks enough and can be done by the baby. So that, the sugar levels in the mother\u2019s milk and in the ingested milk can fluctuate depending on the quality of breast milk. Studies have shown that breast milk has the highest content and that most helpful high-quality dermatological protein, some foods are also presented. Studies have also shown that soy protein formulas have a higher risk of helping the sugar levels, unless they are part of the protein and are followed by the approved.\n\nMeasures for the new uterus to help by changing the blood sugar in an infant include\n\nMeasuring the IR BG levels at least 1 hour after birth and following the early sessions.\n\nIf the symptoms are found by the physician, it is possible that the infant may require a subsequent evaluation to add insulin by the parent doctor.\n\nAppropriate feeding of sugar source as above mentioned.\n\nAs a precaution, if the infant has low blood sugar symptoms and there may be a risk, care needs to be taken during breastfeeding to encourage the infant to feed as closely to their gestational age.

The answers to these questions are discussed in this article.\n\nHypoglycemia, also known as low glucose level, occurs when a diabetic\u2019s glucose drops quickly. You can tell when your blood sugar is too low when you feel shaky or dizzy and, in some people, can cause diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nSome symptoms such as sweating, rapid heart rate, fainting, severe anxiety, blurred vision, hunger, even seizure or coma may also happen.\n\nEither newly diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes can cause hypoglycemia. Some drugs such as sulfonylureas and some insulin used to control elevated blood sugar speed up insulin production and cause hypoglycemia, although your body may not use its insulin immediately.\n\nCertain situations are more likely to cause hypoglycemia. Following a high carbohydrate meal combined with physical activity such as running, lifting weights, hot and cold conditions, alcohol consumption without food, and medications and supplements such as quinine, digoxin and Invokana can cause hypoglycemia.\n\n## 6 Primary Causes of Hypoglycemia in Newborns\n\nThis is a transient condition in babies with no long lasting effects.

This", "Hypoglycemia, more commonly known as Low Blood Sugar, is sometimes unavoidable in newborns. The newborn\u2019s body can adjust to the spike in sugar levels and return to normal conditions within a couple of weeks. Hypoglycemia is noticeable in newborn babies as they will continuously suck their thumb, hand or fingers to seek attention.\n\nIf you have low levels of the blood sugar hormone (Glucagon) on a regular basis, it may cause Hypoglycemia in newborns. Babies that are breastfed instead of being bottle-fed do not carry the sugar required for nutrition. Newborns should have sugar added in their feeding formula or snacks to offset the sugar loss. Parents should not be too dismissive towards the illness simply because it can be healed. Some of the best methods for treating Hypoglycemia include homeopathy and acupuncture.\n\nHere are a few tips that a pregnant woman should follow to avoid passing on the illness.\n\nFood rich in healthy carbs\n\nOpting for food that contains carbs is essential for pregnant women. Healthy carbs are those that contain a substantial amount of fibre. The fibre helps to reduce the pH in the intestinal tract, thereby reducing the effects of Hypoglycemia. Less fermentation means there will be less absorption of glucose in the bloodstream.\n\n### Related posts:\n\nComments are closed.", "For starters, let us take a closer look at what a hypoglycemic newborn goes through. Too little sugar in his body. This in simple terms is Hypoglycemia. The stress hormone from the Nursing Home can help with this as well.

This study is important for two reasons: women following irregular eating schedules are at risk of hypoglycemia. The graying was associated with reduced connectivity of neurons that activate a mechanism to regulate blood sugar during a low-glucose situation. Try to avoid sugary foods and drinks. Women with Gestational Diabetes during pregnancy were also at high risk for giving birth to a baby who carried symptoms of hypoglycemia. \u201cThe original study evaluated gestational diabetes, but because both maternal depression and diabetes are associated with the brain white matter lesions that lead to vascular cognitive impairment, knowledge sharing is sparser. With an unreliable source of glucose, particularly if the mother skips meals or doesn\u2019t eat properly during this crucial period, this could certainly trigger hypoglycemia in an infant.\n\nFollow my instructions, no matter how tired you are!

As these droplets can be heavier than air, they can also end up on other surfaces and then onto the hands and nose of anyone nearby. That means that you can also get the germs by touching things contaminated with the virus and then touching your face.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) hand washing is the most important way to stop the spread of the cold, not just for yourself but for others around you.

In fact, a thorough hand washing requires soapy water and a running faucet as a way to remove germs. Of course, make sure to use warm NOT hot water so you don\u2019t burn little ones.\n\n\u2014Keeping the water running is also important so scrub hands vigorously. How long? Sing 2 full versions of the Happy Birthday song and you are there!\n\n\u2014Most of us don\u2019t share soap unless we are washing up before a meal in a public restroom and children need someone in charge to insist that they use clean towels to dry their hands in school, which they may be reluctant to do.

There are ways to prevent cross-infection and slow the spread of cold viruses.\n\nThe biggest takeaway in maintaining good personal hygiene is: hands are important. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n## Pile on the Soaps\n\nAfter using the bathroom, before and after you eat and after travelling on public transport, you should wash your hands with soap, clean or disinfectant solutions, or a combination thereof.\n\nRemember to wash your hands thoroughly and ensure your hands are dry before opening the door to go home.\n\nWorkspaces should all have washing stations and food preparation should always include washing hands with gloves.\n\n## Cover your Coughs and Sneezes\n\nWhen you do need to cough or sneeze to release a cold, cover it! Covering your mouth or nose means minimising the spread of any germs present.\n\nShould you need to use a tissue, dispose of it immediately rather than leaving it lying around, as this will prolong the contamination.\n\nThere are enzymes in saliva and mucus that kill the influenza virus within a few minutes. In fact, saliva can kill the virus even in the few seconds before it actually reaches your mouth. This is another benefit for coughing into your sleeve instead of your hand.\n\nYou can also cough into your elbow, which will protect all those around us.\n\n## Don\u2019t Worry, We\u2019ve Got Disposals\n\nAn absolute must for hygienic environments is to have tissue and hand sanitiser available to accessible locations, especially counters, washrooms, food areas, and public spaces.\n\nWe all know to wipe your mouth after eating but how often do we think to wash or sanitise our hands afterwards? Sharing snacks or meals with friends is a one of the most common ways for a cold to be spread, so remember to have tissue and clean hands available.\n\nIf you\u2019re after a good sanitisation, but don\u2019t have enough space for a bathroom sink or", "1. Small particles of exhaled or sneezed moisture\n2. Direct contact with mucus next to an infected person\u2019s nose\n3. Objects that have been touched by those transmitting cold germs\n\n### Face Masks and Sneezing\n\nWearing masks and other facial coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is part of daily life and another important tool in our ongoing fight against the global pandemic. It is recommended that all people wear face coverings in public places where it is hard to stay 6 feet (2m) away from others. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is transmitted via droplet spread. Since people with and without symptoms can expel infectious droplets when they cough, cover their coughs, sneeze, talk, or breathe, masks help to prevent the spread of disease in crowded indoor and outdoor areas.\n\nEven though there are numerous types of masks labeled \u201cCOVID-19\u201d it\u2019s worth knowing the difference between them.\n\n- Surgical and Procedure masks: are disposable facial coverings, typical with tie straps, that are designed to protect the wearer from fluid contamination. Because this mask is designed to protect the wearer, it does not prevent the wearer from spreading infection and is therefore not considered Personal Protective Equipment.\n- NIOSH N95: In high-risk clinical situations, e.g. intubation or risk of an aerosol generating event, the administration of the anesthetic nitrous oxide (laughing gas), the insertion of an intratracheal intubation catheter for the administration of any anesthetics or metabolic gases should be performed by a trained practitioner using an N95 mask. The device is worn over the nose and mouth, and filters out 95% of the particles in the air exhaled by the wearer. There are three ways to use an N95 mask: health care workers should use it over a medical mask, a loose-fitting, disposable mask, or a respirator that covers the mouth and nose.\n- KN95, CE0250, and other: KN95 face masks are made with reaction-bonded, melt-blown, and spun-bonded layers to offer N"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3, "rouge1_r": 0.008, "rouge1_f1": 0.0155, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.3, "rougel_r": 0.008, "rougel_f1": 0.0155, "bleurt": 0.7665, "bert_score_p": 0.7287, "bert_score_r": 0.818, "bert_score_f1": 0.7708, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4, "rouge1_r": 0.0098, "rouge1_f1": 0.0191, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.4, "rougel_r": 0.0098, "rougel_f1": 0.0191, "bleurt": 0.3128, "bert_score_p": 0.7652, "bert_score_r": 0.8448, "bert_score_f1": 0.803, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.027, "rouge1_f1": 0.0513, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.5, "rougel_r": 0.027, "rougel_f1": 0.0513, "bleurt": 0.35, "bert_score_p": 0.7783, "bert_score_r": 0.8422, "bert_score_f1": 0.809, "hallucination": 87.5, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.0275, "rouge1_f1": 0.0521, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.5, "rougel_r": 0.0275, "rougel_f1": 0.0521, "bleurt": 0.2998, "bert_score_p": 0.773, "bert_score_r": 0.8631, "bert_score_f1": 0.8156, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.0135, "rouge1_f1": 0.0263, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.4, "rougel_r": 0.0108, "rougel_f1": 0.0211, "bleurt": 0.2754, "bert_score_p": 0.7627, "bert_score_r": 0.8469, "bert_score_f1": 0.8026, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3, "rouge1_r": 0.009, "rouge1_f1": 0.0174, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.3, "rougel_r": 0.009, "rougel_f1": 0.0174, "bleurt": 0.315, "bert_score_p": 0.7571, "bert_score_r": 0.8411, "bert_score_f1": 0.7969, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}]}

I read on a website that said 3000mg daily but my cardiologist says I only need 2000mg daily. Does a higher dosage have greater efficacy?\n\n### Best Answer for: What is the maximum dosage of Metformin?\n\nThe short answer according to the prescribing information is a maximum dose of 3000mg daily. However, the long answer is that Metformin has a high (30%) non-linear growth factor in oral efficacy, so most studies and physicians recognize a maximum dose of 2500mg daily until more information is known.\n\nThis answer contains literally THOUSANDS of words. Buckle up, we're going for a long ride. I'm going to refer to three papers, Probably the most important is the original seminal paper by Nam D. Nguyen examining the non-linear growth factor of Metformin. It's research like this that really drove my interest and curiosity in metformin, and I end up looking at a new study or reading a paper just about once a week. I think when you're done with this answer, you'll realize that we know very little about how to use metformin and that most of what we know is based on evidence that is literally decades old and was obtained through animal testing.\n\nLet's start off with a few definitions:\n\n linear growth: a predictable dose-dependent drug effect\n non-linear growth: a drug effect that is not predicted by the dose of the drug\n bioequivalence: when two drugs have the exact same effect, using the exact same dose. Used to demonstrate that two different formulations of the same drug are sufficiently similar to be considered equivalent, and that one can be substituted for the another on the basis of similar efficacy and safety.\n\nThe commonly prescribed evidence-based maximum daily dose for adults with type 2 diabetes is 2,500 mg/day.

Medical professionals usually recommend a maximum daily dosage for any drug, and Metformin is no exception. The precise amount depends on a variety of factors, including other conditions the patient has, their age, and the general health of the patient.\n\nSo, what is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? Generally, it depends on the progression of the disease. The dose may be adjusted over the course of time, and is changed by the healthcare provider. It is also important to keep in mind that the doctor or other medical professional may prescribe other drugs along with Metformin, which may also alter the requirement of maximum dosage.\n\nGeneral Dosage and Function of Metformin\n\nOn a general note, the dosage spanning five days or up to 1 month includes 500-1000 mg after meals. However, the daily amount of Metformin depends on person to person. A large number of other factors play a role in fixing the maximum daily dosage of Metformin^{[}^{1}^{]} :\n\n- Body weight. Some medical professionals suggest that single doses of 850mg or 1700mg could serve as an alternative to Titration. Maximum daily dosage is dependent on patient\u2019s weight. However, there is no solid evidence to support this claim.\n- Patients taking more than 850 mg daily as a primary restrictive dose, should be tracked for symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, constipation, or diarrhea that occur at lower dose.\n- Management of wound healing at an incision site or amputation stump should be done with caution. Amb\u00e9riene and sinters should also be avoided. When a patient is using Metformin at 850 mg daily, the effect of metformin on wound healing is unknown.\n- Avoid use in case of major oral surgery.\n- Asthma-related emergencies can be aggravated if you take Metformin.\n- If uric acid in a patient\u2019s blood is phosphated or elevated, avoid using Metformin until corrected.\n- Metformin is indicated when liver and kidney functions are stable.\n- Liver insufficiency or reduced blood flow can accompany End-", "Metformin is used to control high blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin may be used alone or with other antidiabetic drugs. Metformin alone is recommended for pre-diabetic patients with hyperglycemia.

Tsuji et al. observed a 5 to 15 year interval between measles and the clinical onset of SSPE (Tsuji et al. 1966). A fifth of these patients died soon after SSPE\u2019s clinical onset(Tsuji et al. 1966). In the US, for a five year period in the 1990s, 16 children with active measles developed SSPE; all were between 16 and 26 months old (CDC 1998).\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that the SSPE in Asia was caused by measles vaccine because the SSPE epidemic in Japan started before the vaccine was introduced. As of now, SSPE is rarely seen in recently vaccinated people, but it\u2019s prone to appear in the unvaccinated. There are 164 cases in England and Wales from 1974 to 2002. The ages of the patients range from three months to 79-years old, with an average age of 25 years. Ninety-five cases were adults, born in 1947 and after. Only one case was born in 1946 or earlier. Most of the patients had a well defined epidemiological link with measles. As of 2012, the CDC reports no cases of SSPE in the United States(CDC 2012).\n\n## Abstract\n\n#### Legal Cases\n\nIn the following cases of SSPE in unvaccinated kids, if their parents won financial compensation in court for a vaccine injury, I was not able to locate these cases among the vaccine injury records.\n\n#### Legal / Medical / Public Health Resources\n\nThe SSPE cases in this database, except for the 1966 report (Tsuji et al.1966), were compiled by medical journals and agencies.\n\nReference:\n\nTsuji H, Nakase M, Azuma T, et al.

Recent reports participate in this perspective.\n\nApproximately 17% of elderly admissions in 2008 were due to stroke, though this percentage has decreased since the 1990s.\n\nUp to 32% of patients admitted for cerebral strokes are infected with wild-type viruses, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, as wells as influenza viruses that can trigger clinical symptoms.", "Hi,\n\nMy husband contracted measles at the age of 12 and was not immunized at that time (lived in Jamaica and immunization was not a priority back then). He was never diagnosed with having measles. Eleven years later he was hospitalized (at Primary care compound in Jamaica) for 5 weeks with an unknown disease (eventually he was diagnosed with SSPE). He eventually returned to the States and now (19 years later) he has an MRI showing a tumor that is the size of a golf ball in his right occipital lobe. The tumor blocks fluid in his brain resulting in hydrocephaly!\n\n95% of people will survive measles without SSPE. Yet, he is nowhere near that. The doctor tells us all that fact. At times, he appears to be an intelligent young man who is able to run multi million dollar companies and yet at times he is a 2-3 year old child who needs help with the most superficial tasks.\n\nIt has been hard for us knowing that all of this could have been avoided if he had been immunized. It makes you think twice before vaccinating your child. Just remember....\" an unventilated blow is a cocked spark\" - Robert E. Vernon\nYou can develop sspe from measels 6 months to 6 years later. But chances are your son will not have it. it is rather rare. As for the tumor he might need to be irraditated. Since this is a late late late sequelae and it would be great to try the vaccination for mumps, measels and rubella and so Puence of happening little or less again.\nThank you very much for your response. With Gods grace, and SSPE and the tumor he will be just fine. I do have a question for you. My husband was vaccinated I believe in 1985 with the new measles vaccine. He received a full inmuneization when I had him tested for SSPE following hisDiagnosis. Both husband and son have a normal vitamin D and calcium levels so their immune system is intact.

The two entities differ\nsomewhat in that HRH is in the infantile hypertension\nform, while KTS\n\nHHT is not usually seen in the\nfirst two years of life and tends to involve the non\u2014\nrectal viscera.

This is one of the more serious congenitally associated malformed syndromes. Three regions of the face are typically affected. This includes the eye, cheek and the forehead area of the infants facial region. (This accompanied by possible AVMS as well). This can be serious and can cause progressive, irreversible brain damage called a seizure disorder.\n\nNeurofibromatosis can develop in later childhood and can create debilitating bone deformities. These changes can be complicated by the KTS's retarded growth and can further worsen the child's gait and limb function. These conditions can represent chronic, painful, disfiguring and disabling conditions.\n\nNon Surgical Treatments (symptomatic)\nThe aim of therapy for people in early childhood without any bodily deformity is to maintain the child's normal growth in stature and provide regular attention to the potential progressive neurologic problems. Losing appendages should be encouraged and any processes that might potentially impede bone from growing properly should be reduced.

{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

This mutation results in a deficiency of vitamin D, which is necessary for the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus from the diet. Without enough vitamin D, the bones become soft and weak, leading to rickets.\n\nThe likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child depends on the type of mutation that is present. If the mutation is autosomal recessive, then both parents must be carriers of the mutation in order for the child to inherit the disorder. If the mutation is autosomal dominant, then only one parent needs to be a carrier in order for the child to inherit the disorder.\n\nThe severity of the symptoms of hereditary rickets can vary depending on the type of mutation that is present. Some people with the disorder may have mild symptoms, while others may have more severe symptoms. In general, people with hereditary rickets are at risk for developing bone deformities, fractures, and other complications.\n\nIf you are concerned that you or your child may have hereditary rickets, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis. Treatment for the disorder typically involves taking vitamin D supplements and avoiding foods that are high in phosphorus. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct bone deformities.\n\n## What is the likelihood of a child with rickets passing it on to their children?\n\nRickets is a condition that results in soft, weak bones. It is most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. Rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D, which is necessary for the body to absorb calcium.\n\nThere are a number of ways that a child with rickets can pass the condition on to their children. The most common way is through the mother\u2019s milk. If the mother has rickets, her milk will not contain enough vitamin D to help the baby\u2019s bones grow properly.\n\nAnother way that rickets can be passed on is through the father\u2019s sperm.

It is a very rare instance, although some people develop hereditary rickets during pregnancy.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hereditary rickets and is it possible to test for it?\n\nSymptoms include growth retardation, bone pain, and often orthopedic problems. Bone X-rays are useful diagnostically but may also help the doctor decide if the condition is the hereditary variety. Although bone X-ray findings are fairly clear, genetic testing is usually done to assist the diagnosis. In addition, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or prenatal testing using DNA from a fetus's tissue can be obtained to confirm hereditary rickets.\n\nIs there any treatment available for hereditary rickets?\n\nThe treatment options are as follows:\n\n- Diagnosis early and treat with vitamin D supplements\n- If not diagnosed early, avoid dietary sources of phosphorus, due to a phosphate intolerance. Avoid dairy, which includes milk, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt. After treatment, phosphorus may be introduced gradually.\n\nNote: Health resources provided by sister sites MyHealth.AL.NHS.UK, Patient.info and Patient.co.uk should not replace a consultation with a qualified health professional to meet your individual medical needs.", "The hereditary rickets does not seem to be sex linked but it seems that the male has greater tendency to become marked with the type of deformity caused when infants try to walk prematurely.\n\nThis may also be due to a more vigorous personality in the males and the female more tolerant of pain and not quite so severe an attack in her.

(1) Although the medical invasion of fibromyalgia took place pretty late: the World Health Organization added it to the Global Burden of Disease list only in 2010. (2) Furthermore, the incomplete understanding of it acutely disables individuals in getting proper treatment.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we shall discuss everything about this disorder including, symptoms, causes, diagnosis methods, as well as its treatment alternatives. (3)\n\n### Symptoms of Fibromyalgia\n\nAdults with Fibromyalgia experience pain all over their body. But often, the disease affects females aged between 20-50 years old. (3, 4) Common symptoms of fibromyalgia are:\n\n- Swelling of joints and bodies\n- Headaches around the neck, shoulders, and upper back\n- Stiff muscles and tissues.\n\nPatients experience sharp pains with excessive tenderness and stiffness in their joints and muscles. (3) The range of pain could vary from mild to severe to chronic. Its impacts can extend to the nerves, as well as disrupt the process of thinking. (4)\n\nGenerally, fibromyalgia has a multi-factorial causation that deteriorates the quality of life severely. Now, let\u2019s discuss the most likely causes of the disease.\n\n### Causes of Fibromyalgia\n\nExperts have identified numerous causes of fibromyalgia after detailed research. It shows a combination of genetic and environmental circumstances.\n\nNaturally, experts hypothesize that it\u2019s more likely to inherit from your family than any other person. However, while investigating this cause the medical researchers have seen an overwhelming pattern.\n\n- The marital relationship of one parent suffering from fibromyalgia increases the risk.\n- Fibromyalgia at an adolescent", "By: Dr. Gavin Pugh, Clinical Director \u2013 Center for Pain Management, Aurora Health Navigators and Dr. Howard Gendelman, Dr. Joseph Bolcato, and Derek Larsen, Center for Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\n\nGenerating sibling rivalries\nBy Kelly P.

It may last for months and even years and there are still doctors that don\u2019t fully understand all the causes of it. There are some drugs that treat a few of the symptoms, but there isn\u2019t a cure for this condition. Weight is important for those who have fibromyalgia because it aggravates many of the symptoms of it.\n\nWhat is Fibromyalgia?\n\nA person with this condition develops pain in injury points on their body, which are tender to the touch. Most of these points are found in the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms and the legs. It\u2019s also possible for those with this condition to experience depression, body achiness and tiredness. The condition is more likely to occur in women than it is in men. It may affect anyone, though at any age, but usually starts when a person is in their 20\u2019s and it\u2019s most likely to start in the 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s.\n\nIt is possible to see a family history of this condition in a family member, but it\u2019s most often the result of a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. The biggest thing that determines fatigued or pain in someone with this condition is even tiny amounts of physical activity. This makes it hard to complete tasks and for many, it turns into a cycle that involves more fatigue and body pain. This fatigue then leads to depression and anxiety which is then associated with even more fatigue. There are attempts to treat this condition in different ways and being that it is hard to understand, many have used medical marijuana for fibromyalgia.\n\nTreatments Possible\n\nThose with fibromyalgia and their doctor can choose from a variety of medications to treat it. Most of these drugs treat some aspects of the symptom of go but they can also have side effects that can make things worse. Early on, drugs are starting being used to get rid of fatigue, headaches and body pain.\n\nSince there is no cure for fibromyalgia, it\u2019s important to help with the symptoms without causing side effects that make them worse.

Patients that has this SNP needs to be aware of the risk and monitor levels of homocysteine in the blood. Lee Evel\u2019s analysis follows.\n\nThe SNP A1298C is caused by a Cytosine to adenine replacement mutation at the 1298 position along the DNA strand in the 5 prime untranslated region of the MTHFR gene c. A1298C substitution leads to a change from arginine to glutamine at position 429 along the amino acid. A1298C nucleotide substitution can not only affect amino acid sequence of methyleneetrahydrofolate reductase to indirectly affect methionine production but may also affect the regulation of the gene expression in humans. Enzyme methyleneetrahydrofolate reductase plays an important role in regulating one carbon metabolic pathways and homocysteine metabolism. Significantly lower serum folate, high levels of homocysteine, lower methionine may directly affect the occurrence and process of arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

That scares me. I hope you can tell me something, because here in Italy the meds do not say anything about it.\n\nANS: Thank you for your question Dr. Mindy.\nThe genetic marker that you mention is one in a series of genetic threats to those with elevated homocysteine.  This post refers to the MTHFR C667T genetic marker but Homozygote MTHFR A1298C is single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) marker that is recessive and can be attributed to a  number of human diseases including elevated homocysteine 12-15 p pmol/mL (2.2 - 2.5 times the upper limit of normal).  It is important to distinguish that this is a snp marker which detects the presence of a genetic marker on EACH of 2 CHROMOSPHERES (i.e. One marker is crossed out).  This is compared to the dominant one nucleotide polymorphism marker C667T in which the marker is simply detected on ONE CHROMOSPHERE. In the vast majority of individuals holding dominant markers there will be a pairing of normal to dominant markers as each chromosome contains a genetic \"copy\" of each individual dominant marker.\nThis type of genetic marker usually does not carry a threat unless the is also the presence of both dominant markers (in the case there is a homozygote).  This is the case with the dominant marker C667T homozygote for example.\nTherefore, the higher concentration of homocysteine in individuals with the A1298C genetic marker does not mean that this marker is the problem.  It simply indicates that there is an non-additive increase in this metabolite.  This would suggest that there is probably another relevant marker involved.\nPreliminary research does seem  to indicate that multiple  MTHFR snp markers have an additive or synergistic effect on hyperhomocysteinemia.

For the most part flatulence comes from indigestible food. Nuts and sugars are a common cause, along with FODMAPS, sometimes caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Flatulence can also be a sign of GI upset or dysbiosis. Most conventional medical approaches to gas do not get to the root of the problem. That\u2019s why many reflexologists and chiropractors say gas symptoms are only a symptom of another underlying condition: weak digestive organs that misdirect foods to the GI tract. In this article, we\u2019ll be exploring the real causes of gas and how to treat it once and for all.\n\nApparently the progesterone dose must be at least about 200mg in order to effectively protect the body from Estrogen Sensitivity which in turn causes flatulence.

There is also vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin K, which are all types of A, E, and K, but only D which are specifically classified as D. Vitamin D is fat soluble because it can be absorbed into our body\u2019s fats.\n\n### Benefits\n\nIs it good for bone health and overall muscle strength? Vitamin D helps to build healthy bones, teeth, and connective tissue. It has been found to have a role in cell growth and growth factors, preventing the breakdown of bones and tissue in the joints. It also supports the immune system by suppressing inflammation and can improve overall muscle strength.\n\nIs vitamin D the only vitamin that can boost your immune system? We all need vitamin D to help control the balance of other nutrients, and the risk of many of us not getting enough of it is that we\u2019ll miss out on it altogether (because it\u2019s not found in meat or milk).\n\n## Can You Take Too Much Vitamin D?\n\nYes, can you take too much vitamin D? If you are taking more than reasonable amounts of vitamin D, you will likely experience headaches, muscle cramps, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and fatigue. There are other side effects as well, such as loss of energy, sweating, and possible hair loss.\n\nIs the amount you\u2019re taking too small to be considered toxic?

Phillips, director of the Vitamin D Society.\n\nVitamin D, known as the \u201csunshine\u201d vitamin, is a fat-soluble vitamin in a family of compounds that include D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol), where only D3 is produced and utilized in humans. D2 and D3 are both converted to the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol), which is created by the kidneys. The term \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d came about because sunlight exposure to the skin (in the case of D3) or supplementation with the vitamin form directly can increase vitamin D concentrations within the body.\n\n#### Deficiency and Activation of Vitamin D\n\nVarious medical references range from 25-50 ng/ml for an optimal vitamin D level, but Life Extension has found this laboratory test to only provide an average snapshot in time resulting in a narrowed window of normalcy. How we maintain optimal vitamin D levels throughout the year depends on many individual factors including the quality of fatty foods, hampered absorption due to the lack of gut integrity, and the paucity of sun exposure throughout the year.\n\nFor maintenance, however, we recommend based on the collective findings of published studies that plasma vitamin D targets be in the 70\u201380 ng/ml range. In the cases where the levels are extremely low, individuals should consider taking upwards of 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily to raise their levels quickly. However, vitamin D toxicity is rare and relates to an excessive correction in plasma vitamin D levels, so caution is advised.\n\nPosted in Ask the Expert and tagged a Nutraceutical, age management, anti-aging, Autism, cancer, D, diabetes, Doctor of naturopathic medicine, Dose, health, holistic medicine, Lyme disease, mental, supplement, therapy, Theraputic Doses, vit, vitamin D, vitamin D expert, wellness.

It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in your body. It can reactivate years later and cause shingles.\n\nShingles is most common in people over 50, but it can occur at any age. It is more common in people who have weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer.\n\nShingles is contagious, but only to people who have never had chickenpox.

Shingles is also known by its medical name \u201cHerpes Zoster.\u201d Patients are usually around 50 years of age or older who have been previously sick with chickenpox or been exposed to Chickenpox a time in their lives. Shingles begins with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection such as cough, sore throat, fever, headache body aches and swollen lymph glands that lasts about one week.\n\n## 1. Painful blisters in distribution of a nerve\n\nActive blisters contain fluid filled with virus. The blisters can be painful and, therefore, painful during any physical activities.\n\n## 2. Viral patch\n\nBlisters at the site of removal of the road traffic accident & skin lesions occur a month to six weeks after the viral patch in the form of the skin and colored or red sores.\n\n## 3. Painful shingles blisters behind operative eye\n\nPatients may feel sensations ranging from burning to numbness on their nerves that could be further affected by bleeding & scarring due to sensitive nerves still present even following successful removal of tumor in a patient with one recent study confirming increased sensitivity to mild stimulus.\n\nBlisters behind eyelids may cause \u2018traction\u2019 on an eye. This is also known to lead to vision loss.\n\n## 4. Headache along the nerve\n\nIn certain circumstances, headache at the back of the head may be one of the signs indicative of this condition.\n\n## 5. Watery eyes in the same eye distribution\n\nProlapse of the eye might mean that shingles may cause eyes to be impacted by minor trauma to the eye. Ultrasound beam has also been found useful in diagnosing this problem.", "The shingles virus is the varicella zoster virus (VZV), very closely related by DNA and antigenic content to the herpes zoster, that cause chickenpox. After recovering from chickenpox, the virus enters the body and genome DNA becomes permanently a latent phase of life life with the sensory nerve ganglia of cranial nerves and dorsal nerve. It dormant and can be activated years later for the emergence of shingles, including the characteristic dermatitis zoster. The varicella zoster virus can cause two acute infections, chickenpox and shingles, due to primary and secondary activation, respectively. Shingles are essentially a reactivation of the virus retained, multiplied in peripheral nerve ganglion nerve root or spinal and migration to the epidermis (skin) opposite the site of herpes zoster through the interneural Schwann cells, in which the virus is proliferating again. The latent virus is activated when immune system defenses are lowered (eg, by age or medical treatment). The onset of shingles can occur from one week to even up to one year after lowering the immune status. After clinical or subclinical infection with VZV, it becomes latent in the neurosensory ganglia, especially on cranial nerves, and usually remains latent. Shingles occurs in rare cases, can be affected with up to 50% of those who were infected with varicella. Time of acquisition latency determines the age of lesions zoster, as it is referred to the diseases of shingles.\n\nShingles - Causes\n\nThese viruses remain latent in peripheral nerves, in small peripheral nerve ganglia, for months or years and at some point can relapse, which is most likely due to the immunosuppressive status of the patient, and cause shingles.\n\nNormally, exposures to environmental toxins throughout health lifewide generates immune response and facilitates the elimination of those toxins in the body. However, the body in response to a series of interrelated toxins may fail to perform this function effectively. Consequently, some toxins accumulate in the body and a state of low-grade inflammation becomes evident in that the so-called immune function declines the overall health", "Before talking on these fancy topics, let\u2019s know \u2018what are shingles?\u2019 Shingles is a medical term or you can say a condition that is also called \u2018zoster.\u2019 This usually affects a segmented portion of the skin that may or may not itch or cause painful blisters. Though it does not last for a long time but the severe form of it (causes caused by bacterial infections) can result in blindness or even death.\n\n## What Causes Shingles\n\nIt causes because of the varicella-zoster virus that remains inside the nerves even after the varicella infection (common name is chickenpox) goes away. After a chickenpox breakout (through direct contact or airborne particle infection), it enters your body and lies dormant in the nerves of your body. But, you can see it causing acute, painful rash formation 30 years after you have been infected with a with a chicken pox.\n\nAbout 1% of the adults usually suffer from shingles, a severe and painful version of chickenpox that typically appears later in life. Usually, the shingles in adults are some how connected to chickenpox. However, shingles in young people can occur also with occasional bacterial infections or due to viral nerve irritation.\n\n## How to deal with the symptoms of shingles?\n\nSome people are already pregnant or under some kind of medications that are causing the shingles. It can be easily confirmed only with the help of a doctor. Now, the general question is generally \u2018How to deal with the symptoms of shingles or what causes shingles.\u2019 It can be easily done with the help of home remedies. Here are some tips that are going to help you prevent shingles:\n\n- Make sure to change your clothes routinely.\n- Pick the doorknobs or any kind of supply and use them as little as possible.\n- Take less stress!\n- Drink tons of water and eat 10 to 12 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.\n- Take a rich diet containing a variety of natural fiber sources in your diet.\n- Also, including foods rich in protein such as whole grains, wheat germs, green leafy vegetables and yogurt in your diet.\n\n### Can shingles go away?\n\nThis is also one of", "Shingles or Herpes Zoster is caused by the same virus as chickenpox. The virus stays in a dormant state in the body after a chickenpox infection. Years later, the virus can reactivate and develop as shingles.\n\nShingles affects all age groups; it is most common in those over 50 years or with a weakened immune system. Shingles is not contagious but can be very uncomfortable because it causes a blistering rash, pain, itch and inflammation.\n\nMost people with shingles will get better within three to four weeks however some people may experience discomfort that develops into a long-lasting, severe pain called post-herpetic neuralgia (after the shingles skin rash is gone).\n\nHow can I prevent shingles from happening?\n\nExperts advise that shingles can be prevented especially as we get older and as our immune system gets weaker.\n\nDoctors find the vaccine with the most scientific evidence and complete protection of the chickenpox-shingles virus is the Zostavax vaccine.\n\nFortunately there are other safer and effective ways than just using the Zostavax vaccine to prevent shingles. These safer ways are the holistic or natural ways with no side effects.\n\nHealthholan natural supplements can help to support a healthy immune system.\n\nTake a diet rich in raw fruit and vegetables especially vitamins A, C and E, green leafy vegetables (spinach, chard, broccoli, lettuce),cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower), capsicums and citrus, legumes, wholegrains and seeds, nuts such as almonds and walnuts, seafood and probiotic supplements plus cut down on sugars and processed foods, as a healthier diet can help to minimize inflammation caused by shingles.\n\nGetting enough sunshine and doing regular exercise helps to boost the immune system.\n\nTaking Shingluccoan natural essential oil and supplement capsules regularly is beneficial to support strengthening the immune system ready to fight off and prevent shingles from happening.", "Shingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. In people with varicella-zoster antibodies shingles appears as a rash in the shape of a strip or band of blisters that wraps around at least one side of the body. The condition starts with prodromal symptoms of pain, burning and hyperesthesia that localize to the area where the rash will erupt. It is unknown why shingles manifests itself in certain people. Learning more about the symptoms of shingles and how to prevent this Virus are essential to avoid complications.\n\nRecent studies have shown that approximately 30% of people who are affected by this condition suffer from severe postherpetic neuralgia even if they take the OTC pain relief medications. What is shingles and how can it be prevented is a question that many people still need to answer. Chickenpox is a common viral infection that is characterized by pus-filled blisters and fever. The common shingles vaccine is often discouraged by doctors, as it has been linked to the development of serious diseases, including cancer. Therefore, it may not be the best protection against chickenpox. A review of literature on chickenpox in pregnant women presented evidence that preventive strategies for primary exposure and booster vaccines in pregnant women are necessary to reduce the occurrence of chickenpox in infants. However, certain precautions should be taken as some of the vaccines for children, such as the MMR and Hep B, cause birth defects in other children who are susceptible to vaccines. Alternative treatment has been identified as safe and effective in treating persons who would otherwise develop shingles.\n\nAlso Known as herpes zoster, it is a disease that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox cases. It mainly occurs after the virus has reactivated in a dormant nerve. The virus remains dormant within the person for many years after the individual has recovered from chickenpox. The disease is characterized by severe pain, burning, and tingling, as well as itchy blisters along a nerve.

These drugs all have different claims, and these claims can range from the mildest to the most aggressive. This article will examine the three names to look for when deciding on the best pain relief for men.\n\nThe most popular name for pain relief in older men is Tylenol. This product is often prescribed in the same dose as Motrin. It is a great drug to buy for the elderly because you don\u2019t need a prescription in order to use it. It is safe to use in just about any situation. The biggest negative with this medication is that it should work for short-term use only. If you take it every day, it may actually decrease your blood flow and cause further damage to your circulatory system.\n\nAnother name to look for when shopping for a pain relief medication for men is Ibuprofen. Just like Tylenol, this product is safe to use in short term use only and should be taken at close intervals. It has several advantages over other medications because it can help with muscle weakness, fatigue, and swelling. It is also available over the counter and without a prescription so there is no hassle for the patient. It is not as strong as the other two drugs, but it is safe to use and gets great results.\n\nThe third name for this type of pain pills for men is PercoCet. This is an over the counter pain reliever. It is stronger than the other two mentioned names. But it can also be just as dangerous. There have been reports of adverse side effects when taking this medication. And like the other two names mentioned above, it should only be taken in short-term use and in close intervals.\n\nNow that you know the most common names for pain relief pills for men, it\u2019s time to choose a brand. Be careful not to get scammed, because some of the so-called pain relief pills for men sold there are not effective. In fact, some of them have been known to cause more harm than good.

That is, of course, a separate issue as well. You are in the sense that you are a regular patient who have an autoimmune disease, nothing else. The thyroid gland facilitates body functions such as menstruation, hormone production, regulation of heartbeat, and also has a fairly large role in determining the metabolic rate of a person. That is why when your body produces too much of the hormone known as T3 and T4 Thyroid hormone, the metabolic rate of your body actually increases.", "I\u2019ve been told that people with CVID have weaker immune systems than other people, and as a result, there\u2019s a chance that tumors might not be detected in time so they eventually result in cancer.

For the thyroid, if it is benign, you need frequent monitoring for growth, but in general we don't do anything to treat it. In my opinion, it is quite common in the general population to have a non-cancerous, multinodular goiter without pain or thyroid issues. The decision to treat comes when the nodule is larger than 1 cm, or if you have any pain. I think it is rare that any of the nodules in the thyroid would be cancerous if they are removed and they are treated with radioactive surgery, which is always an option. The 1 cm seems to be a hard and fast rule even with more advanced imaging and tumor testing and so far we haven't had a nodule larger than 1 cm that has been cancerous, but smaller nodules have been cancerous in my experience.\n\nThe CVID patient undergoing bone marrow transplant is also at risk for getting a transplantation-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome.

This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and requires lifelong insulin therapy.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, and is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors.

Insulin is a hormone that helps the body convert sugar (", "\u200b\n\nOut of all the types of diabetes, type 2, also known as \u201cadult-onset diabetes\u201d, is the most common. It affects how the body processes glucose and often leads to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the body\u2019s inability to use insulin effectively to allow glucose from the blood to move into the cell to be utilized for energy. This forces the cells to become dependent upon other methods to fuel glucose intake. The pancreas then usually responds by producing more insulin, and as more glucose is obtained, it often times becomes difficult for the body to keep up with it. When insufficient energy can be provided to fuel the body, weakness may occur, as well as fatigue on a regular basis. The attributes your body endures from type 2 diabetes can generally depend on how well you respond to your treatment plan. Some never fully conquer it, while others are able to get or stay in remission with proper treatment and taking steps to prevent it.\n\nType 1 diabetes mainly affects children and young adults because Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas becomes damaged and stops producing insulin on its own. This causes high levels of glucose in the blood, which over time can damage the eyes, heart, kidneys, nerves and other organs. Hence, having good blood glucose control can lower the risk of serious complications and can help prevent the disease altogether.\n\nGestational diabetes happens when pregnant women can\u2019t make enough insulin for themselves and the baby. Blood sugar levels usually return to normal after pregnancy but women who have this kind of diabetes are more likely to get type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\nAnother type of diabetes is called prediabetes. It occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Some people who have prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 3 years. If managed through proper treatment, it can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by half!\n\nSo what kind of symptoms do they all usually present with?\n\n\u200b\n\nThe most common diabetes symptom of them all is frequent urination. This happens because high blood sugar levels can trigger your kidneys to produce extra urine. As a result, you\u2019re forced to pee more often. Once little to no insulin is properly produced it then turns to type", "-     - Type 1 diabetes accounts for anywhere from 5-10% of all cases of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes in children, although up to 50% of all cases are diagnosed in adults. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas has lost its ability to produce insulin. There are no known lifestyle changes, either as far as diet or physical activity, that can prevent type 1 diabetes.\n-     - Type 2 diabetes accounts for roughly 90-95% of all diabetes cases. The exact cause or causes of type 2 diabetes are still unknown. However, type 2 diabetes is associated with obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, family history of type 2 diabetes, older age and others. While type 2 diabetes is not preventable in many cases, there are potentially effective strategies to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. For adults at high risk, for example, there\u2019s evidence that losing just 10-15 pounds will prevent type 2 diabetes in many cases.\n-     - The third type of diabetes, gestational diabetes (GD), is a type of elevated blood glucose very similar to type 2 diabetes. The difference is that it is encountered only in pregnant women, and usually in their late second or third trimester. Women with gestational diabetes begin intensive education, lifestyle change, and sometimes insulin treatment in order to ensure the best health for themselves and their babies. Most women who experience gestational diabetes will not develop type 2 diabetes. However, 40-60% of women with a history of GD will have GD in future pregnancies. In addition, a 20% of women with gestational diabetes will go on to develop diabetes within the next 10 years. If you develop gestational diabetes, your lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes is 3x higher than someone who has never had GD. Here\u2019s a comic from Medimoon depicting what a diabetes speaker called \u2018see food\u2019 diet looks like.\n-     - There are also three types of gestational diabetes: early onset gestational diabetes mellitus (EOGDM) which is diagnosed within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and is usually the transient type of GD, intermediate gestational diabetes mellitus (IGDM) is diagnosed at 24-32", "Autumn Doughton tells us the latest research about the different types of diabetes and myths surrounding the disease.\n\n### Childhood Diabetes\n\nDiabetes, what is it?

According to Experts.com, there are  different types of diabetes to complicate to memory. What is diabetes?? Diabetes is when a person\u2019s body cannot produce enough of insulin, which is an important hormone that helps to maintain a constant level blood sugar.\n\n### Type 1 Diabetes vs. Type 2 diabetes: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nThere are two different types of diabetes based on their origins.\n\n### Photos of feet with Type 2 diabetes\n\nType 1 diabetes is also referred to type 1 diabetes or juvenility diabetes. Is the most serious condition that is caused by the total absence of insulin in blood. And it requires constant daily insulin treatment either with the use of several daily insulin injections or administered through an insulin pump. Type 1 diabetes is the most common type experienced by children and many times caused by genetics. It is a metabolic disease, which causes the body to completely lack the production of insulin and the pancreas not make enough insulin.\n\nThis happens when the immune system body attacks its own pancreatic cells and violence beta cell.

Most of type 1 diabetes is not reversible but produces interpretable and adequate diet, exercise and other home care measures as prescribed by doctors that can help to delay", "These are the questions most people ask regarding diabetes. Knowing the types of diabetes and how it affects your whole body can be crucial since diabetes if left untreated can cause several complications.\n\nDiabetes occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or doesn't respond to insulin, causing glucose to abnormally high levels in the blood also known as hyperglycemia. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, that helps the body use and store carbohydrates and fats. Forms of blood glucose come from carbohydrates including sugar, pasta, bread and potatoes, as well as from fruits and dairy products. More complex carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables and beans need to be broken down into simple sugars before they can provide the body with glucose.\n\nThere are 2 main forms of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2, and the third one is gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy. Both types 1 and 2 are often chronic diseases that lasts a lifetime. Diabetes can result in many severe complications if you don't control it, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, vision difficulties, nerve damage and memory issues, among others.\n\nType 1 diabetes is diagnosed as early as childhood, during childhood or teens, although it can be diagnosed during adult years too.\n\nFormerly known as juvenile diabetes, type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas stops producing the insulin hormone required by the body to regulate the amount of glucose in the blood. There is no known cure for this type of diabetes and is chronic and complicated, but when correctly treated with insulin, it can more easily manage.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, blood glucose levels may also be too low focal it has been too long since eating or if you have not eaten enough over the hours. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include frequent urinating, feeling thirsty, weight loss, tiredness, blurred vision or blindness for related to the lens of the eyes, diabetic coma or diabetic shock.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common results both from lack of exercise and obesity. The problem occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin to control blood glucose levels. This form of diabetes can also", "There are several types of diabetes, and it can be difficult to manage each separately. Here we explore each type and how they affect the body.\n\n## What Is Diabetes?\n\nThe human body converts sugar, starches, and other foods into a simple sugar, glucose, in order to use it as fuel for the cells. When the body doesn\u2019t have enough insulin to convert the glucose, the blood sugar levels rise, leading to high blood sugar. High blood sugar can be harmful and if not controlled, can lead to complications.\n\nThe insulin produced by the body doesn\u2019t work as well as it should with diabetes. It\u2019s important that these levels are managed over your lifetime as this will help with the possibility of stroke or heart disease. You can read more about it here: diabetes and heart disease\n\nThere are three different types of diabetes. They are type 1, type 2 and gestational. The first two types can occur in the adult world while gestational diabetes occurs in pregnant women only.\n\n## Type 1 Diabetes\n\nAn autoimmune disease occurs to cause type 1 diabetes where the body attack itself and eliminate the production of insulin. Without insulin, the body cannot get the glucose to perform its regular functions because it\u2019s in the blood and can\u2019t enter cells for energy and use.\n\nToo much sugar can build up and cause complex health problems and lead to other diseases over the long term such as stroke, cardiovascular disease, nerve damage and kidney damage.\n\nThe exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, but they follow a list of symptoms for everyone that may include:\n\n- Increased productivity\n- weight loss even though was eating more\n- thirst\n- appetite, frequent urination\n- blurred eyes\n- difficulty concentrating\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes\n\nThis is the most common type of diabetes, where insulin remains in the blood and does not reach the cells of the body.

What would be the best way of tapering myself off of it to avoid the withdrawal syndrome? Thank you, I'm just really nervous about taking it away.\n\nThanks for your trusting email, but I think in fact you should let your prescriber handle your taper. You are clearly an expert at using bupropion yourself, and you've given him/her all the information he/she needs, so why not just leave it to the prescriber? I have had patients successfully taper down bupropion very slowly; a small dose is withdrawn from time to time, and then an interruption of a few days is placed when especially low bupropion concentrations are expected in the patient. This is done so the patient gets an \"emergency\" psych consultation if he/she needs more bupropion. I am aware there can be withdrawal problems with these drugs even though there is no physical addiction to your question's bupropion, but my experience with this has generally been \"narrow.\" I wish you the best, Doctor Bill Do not hesitate to call me if you need anything, or even if you just want to share more of your story in private.\n\nWhat is Wellbutrin used for?\n\nWhat is Wellbutrin used for?

Or in other words, I talk too much and sleep until 11 a.m. but feel great, better than ever! I stopped WELLBUTRIN XL 80 mg last year, originally in Feb or March and found myself thinking of death and suicide. I could not believe I was having such thoughts at the age of 59 years and so I started at the original dose of WELLBUTRIN XL 150 mg. A month later I cut back to 100 mg and two months later to 75 mg and then one month to 50 mg and then WELLBUTRIN XL 37.5 mg and finally just WELLBUTRIN SR 300 mg over a period of about three months. I did feel bad during this time but not exactly go into the depths of despair thinking of death and suicide. I am on WELLBUTRIN SR 300 mg twice a day now with the next step probably to cut back once more to dropping this to once a day and finally to get around to dropping all other psycho-active medications. Do you have any suggestions on how to do this?\nNrse\nYou are right that shorter acting antidepressants could behave differently than extended release formulations. When in doubt, I would be inclined to stay on 150 mg. I do not feel there is a compelling reason to drop the dose at this time and it might delay \"real symptoms\" . . more complicated than just, \" You feel great and do not want this medicine to stop working before it is time.\" That's not an unreasonable sentiment. People feel better, are able to sleep and energized enough to get up at decent hours. That's great. There is danger if a minimum dose while the person feels great is chosen. People get great feelings if they drink alcohol for example, and it is hard for them to realize how much hurt they are causing to themselves, their friends and family members. Another consideration is that people experience the loss of their medication without behavioral symptoms. In other words, if we don't have the behaviors to detect our depleted levels, when sad feeling return and depression strike again it would be hard to identify the triggers of the depression.

Generally, for people at increased risk for liver complications -- those who have diabetes or excessive alcohol use -- lipid tests should be repeated one to two weeks following their first filling of the prescription. For individuals who have normal lab values, repeat testing may be done at six months and on a yearly basis, depending on your doctor\u2019s orders.\n\nSeveral factors other than liver function may increase the likelihood of statin-induced muscle disease to occur. These include whether you have low COMT levels, low vitamin D levels, older age or ischemic heart disease, kidney disease, or having multiple statin use.", "#\n\n\u2014 Jared City, Summerville, S.C.\n\nLipitor (atorvastatin) is used to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and angina in people with vascular disease, heart disease, or diabetes and in those 55 or older who have other risk factors for these conditions, according to the National Library of Medicine\u2019s Drug Information Portal.\n\nOther reasons Lipitor is prescribed include reducing the amount of fatty material that collects within artery walls and lowering levels of bad cholesterol, particularly LDL, the low density lipoprotein. Lipitor has been the No. 1-selling drug in the United States for several years. According to www.medicalbillest.org, Lipitor is used by more than 3 million Americans.\n\nIs every patient on Lipitor going to now be included in this group?\n\nNo. Doctors take a patient\u2019s past history of liver issues into consideration as well as the patient\u2019s age, gender, the presence of other diseases, weight, other medications that may have a negative impact on liver function, and alcohol consumption.\n\nIf someone does have a liver issue and is on Lipitor, we have to closely monitor that patient. In fact, all patients should have their liver function monitored, especially if that patient is over 65, is on more than one cholesterol medication, has other medical problems, or takes lots of other meds for other diseases or conditions.\n\nDoes this apply to other statins?\n\nPossibly, but Lipitor comes from Pfizer, a leader in pharmaceutical products such as atorvastatin.\n\nBack in the early 1990s my doctor of the time, Dr. Elliot Weinstein, a very well respected physician, told me at my annual physical that my cholesterol was high. He was not concerned at the time, but said I should do something about my weight.\n\nHe then said, \u201cHere\u2019s a paper. This is a very good drug for me, but I\u2019m not going to put my patients on it because it\u2019s too new. Go to WebMD or Medline or the National Institutes of Health and do your own homework. My advice is simple: See what\u2019s there and do it for yourself. It\u2019s not my job. There are", "Mary S. - Chicago | September 24, 2010\n\nLipitor is a statin. It is in the same family of drugs as cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol. Statins alleviate the symptoms of hyperlipidemia \u2013 abnormally high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These drugs inhibit the production of cholesterol by altering some of the chemical steps involved in the production. Statins are the most widely used drugs for abnormally high cholesterol levels. In addition to Lipitor, statins include; lovastatin (Mevacor), lovastatin extended-release (Altoprev), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), simvastatin extended-release (Zocor extended release, Vytorin), pravastatin (Pravachol, Selektine) and atorvastatin (Lipitor).\n\nThe concern about statins and liver function results from the reports of deaths of patients who stop taking the drug. While most researchers could not definitively correlate the stoppage of statin usage with the onset of liver disease, it was decided to monitor the medication in order to prevent containing collateral liver damage. The best way to assess liver function is to utilize the hepatic functions (Liver Function Tests or LFT\u2019s) \u2013 these tests include:\n\n1.bilirubin\n\n2.aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\n\n3.alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\n\n4.alkaline phosphatase (ALP)\n\n5. Albumin\n6.Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)\n\n7.Prothrombin time (PT)\n8.International normalized ratio (INR)\n\n9.Immunoglobulin G (IgG)\n\nIf one liver functional test changes, it may be due to another underlying non-liver disease. Thus, it is important to run aliquots of both baseline data and current levels of LFT\u2019s to assess the level of specificity of the increased readings.\n\nIf a patient has a positive LFT report, it may be useful to discontinue the drug and ask the physician", "This is according to the Lipitor package insert (www.lipitor.com/pi/pdf/lipitor.pdf).\n\nFor every other patient approved for Lipitor use, this is the routine that is suggested. The reason is that Lipitor has to be metabolized by the liver. If an individual has a liver problem he/she may not be able to properly metabolize Lipitor, possibly causing more harm than benefit.\n\nThe liver function blood tests that are done monitor this process of lipid metabolism.\n\nLisa J.

It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"", "Must_have": ["Calcium supplements can be beneficial for persons diagnosed with osteoporosis as sufficient calcium intake may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.", "Alongside calcium, intake of vitamin D is also important as it aids in the absorption of calcium in the body."], "Nice_to_have": ["Magnesium, iron or zinc should be taken at a different time from calcium as these elements can interfere with calcium absorption.", "Adequate physical activity alongside a well-balanced diet including calcium and vitamin D can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life.", "Vitamin D can also be produced by skin when exposed to sufficient sunlight.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized health claims related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements."], "sample_predictions": ["The answer to the first question is yes, but the answer to the second question is no.\n\nOsteoporosis is a disease of the bones that is characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density. This results in a decrease in bone strength and an increased risk of fractures.\n\nThe most common cause of osteoporosis is a lack of calcium in the diet. Calcium is an essential mineral that is needed for the growth and maintenance of bones. Without enough calcium, the bones become weak and brittle.\n\nCalcium supplements are often recommended for people who have osteoporosis. These supplements can help to increase the amount of calcium in the body and improve bone health.\n\nMagnesium is another mineral that is important for bone health. However, there is no evidence that magnesium supplements are beneficial for people who have osteoporosis.\n\nIn fact, there is some evidence that magnesium supplements may actually be harmful for people with osteoporosis.\n\nMagnesium can interfere with the absorption of calcium, and it can also cause diarrhea.\n\nIf you have osteoporosis, it is important to talk to your doctor about the best way to get the calcium and magnesium you need.\n\n## What is the best calcium supplement for osteoporosis?\n\nThere are many different calcium supplements on the market, and it can be difficult to know which one is best for osteoporosis.\n\nThe best calcium supplement for osteoporosis is one that is absorbed well by the body and provides the right amount of calcium.\n\nThere are two types of calcium supplements: calcium carbonate and calcium citrate.\n\nCalcium carbonate is the most common type of calcium supplement, and it is absorbed well by the body.\n\nCalcium citrate is a newer type of calcium supplement, and it is absorbed better than calcium carbonate.\n\nCalcium carbonate is the best calcium supplement for osteoporosis because it is absorbed well by the body and provides the right amount of calcium.\n\n## What is the best calcium supplement for osteoporosis and magnesium?\n\nThere are many different calcium supplements on the market, and", "Does vitamin D help a person with osteoporosis?

If so, are there any brands that test for this amount with their calcium supplements?\n\nDear Sharon,\n\nThis is a common question these days and will be the focus of a CNN documentary starting on New Year\u2019s Eve. The short answer is that no one is sure of the answer to your the question. The theories are evolving and the facts are trying to catch up.\n\nThe nutrition world had it easy in 1980 when the RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) protocol was established. Today, the nutrition science community is extremely concerned the current protocol may create unnecessary problems.", "They seem to be able to order calcium any way they want. In another problem, my wife is diabetic, and is unable to find a diabetic cod liver to order for her. I have located a knockoff cod liver oil with DHA and EPA that is considered to be high quality, but it very expensive.\n\nLastly, I have heard it said that it is important to take coenzyme Q10 as a supplement when using a statin drug. But if so, how much should be ordered and how often should it be taken? Most oral doses are quite large. Even when taken every third day, it is something like 10 times the typical dose found in medical literature on amciprenalo\n\nhttps://www.ssbystu.com/forum/topics/should-i-try-procaine-injection-would-like-some-other", "Osteoporosis is the reason why bones become weak and susceptible to fracture. Characterised by a decrease in bone mass and density, it mostly affects the hips, wrists and spine. For those who have suffered a fracture, there is decreased bone strength, but it cannot be identified by the absence of pain. There is a risk of repeated fractures. Persons with osteoporosis have a decreased calcium content in their bones. As such, an increase in calcium is usually a good message to give, to those who have osteoporosis. Calcium supplementation has been recommended to support the protection of bone tissue. But, there may be concerns that the calcium may be collected elsewhere; if too much calcium is absorbed, it can be stored in tissues such as the arteries, and cause damage. Regardless, calcium supplementation with vitamin D may benefit and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. The D recommended as supplementation is 800-1,000 IU/day.\n\nSecretion of the hormone calcitonin may also be beneficial for bone quality. Some persons have mutations in the calcitonin gene, which have been associated with decreased bone mass, and increased fracture frequency.\n\nThe other concern with calcium is that it may be deposited in kidney tissue. Some persons who have had renal calculi removal procedures, have what professionals call technical term \"calcium phosphate deposition\". This calcium phosphate deposit may not be evident in x-rays. The use of a low-calcium diet and certain calcium phosphate chelators have been recommended for prevention of recurrence.\n\nMagnesium salts are also used to make \"laxatives\". I would be concerned with the addition of magnesium for disordered bowel function when calcium has already been shown to have been already absorbed and deposited in unwanted places.\n\nThe amount of calcium recommended should not be taken single-handedly, while taking 1,500mg/day of magnesium citrate added on. Rather, it may be advisable to boost calcium with foods rich in calcium, like dark green vegetables, dairy products, and nuts.", "Osteoporosis occurs when the mineral density of bones gets decreased. People with osteoporosis while walking can bend over or stoop forward in an effort to release any pain or discomfort that they might be feeling in the hips and lower back.\n\nIf a person who has osteoporosis is taking a calcium supplement, there is a probability that this person views that all of their requirements for good health and disease consultation has been taken care of. But, that understanding may be in error, as magnesium is required by the body to seize and use the calcium.\n\nMagnesium seems to both enhance the positive benefits and decrease the negative aspects of the supplement of calcium under many circumstances. Results recently published in an English language version of the Bone Research, suggest that magnesium, as a single mineral, may have as much impact as calcium salts when the purpose is to increase bone mineral density (BMD).\n\nFurthermore, such an impact can be up to three times or more the levels employed when calcium salts are administered all by themselves.1 Calcium in many supplements will work poorly, in part due to the fact it is not joined to magnesium. This illustrates the need to get truthful info on the label, and to comprehend what the quantity of calcium combined signifies for your body.\n\nCalcium carbonate as an instance supplies just 21% of the stated quantity of calcium in the supplement. This is because the substances are not strikingly reactive with the body. Occasionally when combining the multitude of drugs a person might be taking the possible synergistic effects with calcium intake should also be investigated Review. Typically, calcium supplements have additional vitamin D, like Vitamin B6, Vitamin K1, and other minerals.\n\nSometimes calcium supplements are synthesized to include a setting that will provide for stable calcium dispersal with a decrease in the potential gastric side-effects of calcium intake supplements. Magnesium improves bone mineral density when calcium is present. Non-active calcium supplements on the contrary minimize magnesium in the bloodstream.\n\nA little decrease in this level may often be noticed on tests; whereas with larger doses of calcium, calcium alters the chemical environment significantly.

Examples include: How well the joints move back and forth and side to side; how flexibility in the joints like hips, legs, knees, elbows, and shoulder blades.\n\nThe School of Physical Therapy at the University of Sydney, Australia, has developed the Beighton Score to distinguish people with EDS from those without.

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Trisomy 7 is a rare genetic disorder that occurs when a person has three copies of chromosome 7 instead of the usual two.

The most common form of trisomy is Down Syndrome where the 21st chromosome has an extra copy.\n\nDifferent chromosomes cause different functional complications for those who have trisomy. Some trisomies are completely harmless and some are lethal. It occurs spontaneously when an egg or sperm cell has an extra copy of a chromosome before combining with the chromosomes of the other perspective.\n\nTrisomy 7 or 7 Trisomy can occur following trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).\n\n## What Exactly is Trisomy 7?\n\nIn a person with trisomy 7, chromosome 7 is in triplicate instead of the usual two. The additional copy or copies of chromosome 7 will disrupt one or more of its genes. There are at least 788 different confirmed genes on chromosome 7 with numerics varying between individuals and cell types.\n\nIn cases where 7 Trisomy does not cause major birth defects or lead to sudden death in an infant, it is generally a Title 30 Catholic birth defect.

It results in random integrations based on where the extra copy(s) of chromosome 7 end up. This randomness means that 7 Trisomy is not passed down from one generation to the next, making 7 trisomy incredibly rare.\n\nAccording to reports, only 34 babies have ever been born with trisomy 7 to date and 15 babies with 7 Trisomy have survived to adulthood. One of these adults seems to be the subject of a 7 trisomy document featuring his life from birth to now.\n\nElectron Microscopy / Shutterstock.com\n\n## Complications\n\nTrisomy 7 can cause numerous physical defects and", "This is a newly recognised condition in which too many chromosome 7's are present, that is to say either three rather than the usual two. Such a development can lead to several medical problems that depend on the types and combinations of genes which are involved, that is to say the child might have a problem with learning for instance or with blood clotting.\n\nThe mutated cells can affect nearly all major systems of the body and distant organs of the body in unpredictable ways. Trisomy 7 is very rare, in fact just one in a million live births. Some cells of the body double their genetic makeup and these develop further eventually forming a mass or tumour. The prognosis is similar in these circumstances to lots of growths we described earlier.\n\nThese tumours are made up of three copies of genes on chromosome 7. For the most part children that have this genetic make up are otherwise perfectly fit, imaginative and skilled children that are fortunate enough to live a normal life. One of the best known conditions is now called Noonan syndrome although it is previously described in other terms. It affects 1 in 2,500 people has many differences from child to child but has similarities in almost 80% including the face, palm etching, heart results, learning and other possible aspects disordered by its unpredictable behaviour and changes between affected siblings in short term. The main cause is now considered to be that presented by the order of chromosome 7. Inheritance is occasionally tranmitted though any future births depend on which process led to the child's chromosomes.\n\nProblems include many orthopaedic areas particularly limb development, heart arrhythmias, blood disorders including respiratory problems or joint laxity. Children may face learning disabilities and be hypersensitive to hearing and sight. Treatment in these circumstances is concentrated on individual symptoms, difficulties and needs. Healthcare providers and parents and teachers become involved in facing hypersensitivity, learning difficulties and other genetic conditions.\n\nSome of the genes on chromosome 7 have a marked interaction with genes on chromosome 9 and 21 when a duplication also is present. This gives rise to conditions such as Down's syndrome, where not only intelligence but also other aspects of systems are involved such as in heart irregularity, respiratory symptoms of muscular", "Trisomy 7 is a rare genetic condition in which three copies of chromosome 7 develop in some cells. This extra piece of genetic material is thought to cause a variety of physical and intellectual disabilities which range in severity. The spectrum of disabilities associated with trisomy 7 tends to include heart defects, kidney and bladder problems, certain types of leukemia, intellectual disability, and congenital defects in the gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. Treatment for individuals with trisomy 7 varies widely. It all depends on the severity of the presentation and which organs are affected. Since all nine of the chromosomes are involved, the spectrum of possible issues is greater than what is seen with the trisomy 21 that causes Down syndrome.\n\nResources:\nNational Association for Rare Disorders (NORD)", "Trisomy 7 appears to cause growth restriction in addition to malformation of the head, brain, face, and chest.  Surgery of the chest may be needed periodically to drain excess fluid that may accumulate in the heart and lungs.  In addition, there may be bleeding from the nose.  Trisomy 7 was previously thought to cause overgrowth, but this has not proven to be the case. No treatments have been recommended or shown to be helpful. Medical treatment of associated/underlying conditions would be appropriate.\n\n## Thank you!\n\nYour question has been submitted for review by a member of our team.", "Does Triplo 7 make you more creative?\n\nTrisomy 7 is a genetic condition where a person inherits an extra copy of chromosome 7 in every cell in their body. This can lead to a range of physical and developmental abnormalities, which vary depending on the exact genes that are affected.\n\nThe most common physical symptoms of trisomy 7 are growth retardation and developmental delay. However, other symptoms can also occur, such as learning difficulties, vision problems, and heart defects. There is no known cure for trisomy 7, but there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms.\n\nCreativity is not known to be more common in people with trisomy 7. However, it is possible that some people with trisomy 7 may have a different way of understanding the world and communicating their thoughts and ideas. This could lead to people with trisomy 7 being more creative in certain areas.\n\n## How does trisomy 7 affect the body?\n\nTrisomy 7 is a genetic disorder that causes the body to have three copies of Chromosome 7. This extra chromosome causes mental and physical abnormalities. Some common symptoms include developmental delay, seizures, heart defects, and a brain disorder called holoprosencephaly.\n\nIn holoprosencephaly, the brain does not divide into two hemispheres properly. This can lead to problems with vision, hearing, and vomiting. Other symptoms of trisomy 7 may include facial abnormalities (such as cleft lip or palate), bone abnormalities (such as clubfoot), and eye abnormalities (such as cataracts).\n\nTrisomy 7 is usually diagnosed when the baby is born. However, it can also be diagnosed during fetal ultrasound or amniocentesis. Treatment varies depending on the symptoms present. Some possible treatments include surgery to repair heart defects, medication to control seizures, and physical therapy to improve motor skills.\n\n## What are the risks of trisomy 7?\n\nThe risk of having trisomy 7 is low, but it can be increased if the mother is over the age of 35.

Untreated and uncontrolled bp may lead to other major diseases such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, kidney disease, cognitive decline, sexual problems, and even death.\n\nWhat is the difference between normal blood pressure and high blood pressure?\n\nBlood pressure is all about how much pressure does blood put on the walls of the arteries.\n\nBlood is pumped from the heart and the circulation system is out little by little so that force is always needed to keep the blood flowing through the body.\n\nBlood pressure values are recorded with the help of two readings they are systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.\n\nSystolic pressure which is the top reading is the force of blood against the arteries when the heart is resting between beats.\n\nOn the other hand, diastolic pressure which is the bottom reading is the force of blood against the arteries when the heart is beating.\n\nHigh blood pressure is the level of blood pressure that is higher than ninety percent of the normal population (for example, 140 over 90 mmHg) howie found that the majority of people who have high blood pressure do not have any symptoms, so testing and diagnosis are usually the only means of discovering", "Metformin can cause low blood pressure, so people who already struggle with low blood pressure may not be able to use metformin.\n\n## Does metformin 1000 mg raise blood pressure?\n\nIn addition, metformin did not promote increases in systolic pressure but actually reduced diastolic pressure. The diastolic/systolic pressure ratios in Group H at 3 and 6 months were similar.\n\n## Does Metformin cause elevated blood pressure?\n\nAbstract. Metformin, an oral antihyperglycemic agent, at usual doses does not raise serum triglycerides, cause weight gain, or generally lower blood pressure. These oisemetse effects frequently deter physicians from using metformin as an initial hypoglycemic drug.\n\n## Before I go on metformin What should you know?\n\nTell your doctor if your ever had: lactic acidosis, kidney issues, liver disease, alcoholism, problems of circulation, thyroid hormone levels, vitamin b, i-12 or b, i-24 deficiency, bleeding problems, heart blockage, stroke, heart rhythm problems, allergic reaction to metformin or to a sulfa drug.\n\n## How often should I take metformin?\n\nA: Metformin is often taken two to three times daily. Patients taking this medication should check with their prescribing doctor to establish a dosing schedule.\n\n## Does metformin lower blood pressure and heart rate?\n\nMetformin can lower heart rate slightly, possibly due, in part, to reduced sympathetic nerve activity, indicating a potential preventive role for metformin in cardiovascular disease [11].\n\n## Is metformin bad for kidneys?\n\nMetformin has been your diabetes medication for several years. If you have kidney problems, talk with your doctor about whether metformin is safe for you. It can lead to a type of kidney failure called lactic acidosis. In the U.S., the FDA added a warning label for this to the drug starting in 2005.\n\n## How long does it take for metformin to work?\n\nMetformin lowers blood sugar by reducing the liver\u2019s glucose production and making the body more responsive to insulin provided by", "Let\u2019s explore.\n\nThe research is somewhat conflicting, however, metformin does not cause the body to have lowered blood pressure for most people. It can cause high blood pressure in some metformin users since the medication lowers glucose levels in the body. However, these associations are not solid as the treatment is effective for a myriad of health conditions \u2013 blood pressure included.\n\nDuring this article, we will discuss how metformin causes higher blood pressure for specific individuals and how as a whole, metformin treatment manages pre-diabetic and diabetic conditions.\n\n## What Makes Metformin Effective for Blood Pressure?\n\nAs metformin is an antihyperglycemic, its primary job is to improve blood glucose levels in the body as a nutritional treatment. However, there are advantages that stir from lower glucose levels in the body. Let\u2019s discuss the relationship between blood glucose levels and blood pressure.\n\n### Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure\n\nToo many health problems and illnesses date back to excess inflammation in the body. Having high blood glucose levels in the body can lead to blood vessel damage, heart disease and the onset of diabetes. However, high blood glucose levels can also produce inflammation and create an interference in the kidneys.\n\nThis can lead to a lot of salt and water retention in the body. With excess fluid and salt in the body, there will eventually be damaging impacts on the cardiovascular system. Hence, blocking excess sodium and fluid helps with ambulatory blood pressure and can reduce the chances of heart and kidney disease.\n\n### Metformin Effects on Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure\n\nA study published in Diabetes Care highlights the impacts of low-intensity prescribed training and isometric heavy-resistance exercises on individuals with otherwise uncontrolled blood pressure on metformin. The study suggests there were no variations in body mass or hypertension function, however, participants were more susceptible to hypoglycemia when utilized with metformin.\n\nThis reflects on Taylor & Francis\u2019 study that gives the advantages of metformin for people who suffer from hypertension.

Still, patients that are prescribed metformin as treatment for hypertension typically also have type 2 diabetes. Thus, these individuals already have to worry about avoiding heart-related diseases and types 2 diabetes-related health consequences.\n\nUnfortunately, the medication does cause some side effects. Metformin causes side effects like:\n\n\u2022 Nausea\n\u2022 Diarrhea\n\u2022 Vomiting\n\u2022 Fecal urgency\n\u2022 Upset stomach\n\u2022 Anemia (in rare cases)\n\u2022 Causes lactic acidosis in combination with other medications, advanced renal impairment or excessive alcohol use\n\nThese are just some of the reasons metformin-induced hypertension can be difficult to manage and control.\n\nAvoid\nDue to the side effects of metformin, you should try to avoid consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Alcohol exacerbates lactic acidosis. You should also avoid consuming metformin and other medications that contain metformin such as glucophage xr, glycomet, metformin-rosiglitazone and Janumet.

It is now known that the combination of NSAIDs with specific substances which possess certain structural characteristics affects their efficacy by exerting different mechanisms [6]. Among topical anti-ulcer agents, NSAIDs may either work in synergy or antagonistic interactions depending on their properties. For instance, diclofenac reduces the activity of H2-receptor blocking agents [7].\n\nData indicate that the synthesis of NSAIDs with various biological activities and new delivery forms lead to the development of safer compounds [8]. In addition, new NSAIDs with various delivery forms are being explored as an alternative in search for NSAIDs which would effctively reduce ulcer formation without exerting gastrointestinal and high-risk symptoms [9].

Whose right in this context? Also is smokeless tobacco (chewable tobacco like Skoal) better than smoking?\n\nThere are definitely bad consequences in the long term for both smoking and 'chewing.'\n\nWhen the nicotine is absorbed orally from lozenges, gum, snuff or chewing gum, it bypasses a portion of the body's natural defenses. Thus harmful substances may then reach the blood supply quicker. Also, expectorant-type chewing tobacco and chewable tobacco cause more damage to oral tissues- think Gumby teeth- and possibly some esophageal irritation as well. They also bypass some natural body mechanisms.\n\nIf you chew or dab, you get nicotine directly into the blood from the oral tissues as well as breathing it in second hand. If you smoke say, three to four cigarettes a day over 20 plus years, you'll get atherosclerosis of the coronary coronaries.\n\nOral cancers in young people are on the rise because they're smoking and chewing. Smoking seems to increase the chance of getting it 1000 fold.\n\nNicotine in the body causes you to excrete more chloride, which means you urinate more. Most of this is water, but it also leads to a lot more potassium loss. Bicarbonate loss also occurs, and that's calcium neutralizer. Activation of the adrenal glands leads us to put on weight.

The role of these is to both break down and assist in the digestion of food.\n\nTherefore it makes sense that if you smoke or use nicotine, this may have some further impact on your body.\n\nWhat are some potential impacts of smoking on digestion?\n\nHowever, when it comes to smoking, there is another set of risk factors upon the digestive system.\n\nOne major risk with smoking is the higher risk of disease within the digestive system. Part of this is because of the added reflux caused by coughs and the need for the digestive organs to exert extra effort. A smoker\u2019s lungs are created for them to be able to cough up smoker\u2019s lung, something that no one wants. However, the body always signs its intent by the warnings done in advanced.\n\nBecause of the extra effort that is required on the system, the risk of ulcers becomes heightened. If you notice any frequent bloating, particularly without any underlying cause, smoking may be the reason. Frequent acid reflux may be the consequence of such. The increasing risk of developing conditions such as pancreatitis. A serious condition within the pancreas, the pancreas is improved for the purpose of excreting the digestive prime and supplement to aid in the up-take and production of fat, protein and carbohydrate.

As a result, high caffeine drinks and lots of fluid is required for things to be", "Nicotine is an alkaloid found in the tobacco plant, the addictive substance in cigarettes. Though all nicotine is addictive, research has found that the combinations in cigarettes give nicotine an addictive quality that is stronger and more powerful than other ways of using nicotine, such as chewing the tobacco leaf itself, smoking cigars, or using nicotine lozenges. The extreme cravings that we feel when we are trying to quit smoking are a part of the way that nicotine changes the brain.\nWhen you are first beginning to smoke cigarettes or nicotine products, the brain\u2019s response controls cravings and effects on anxiety. Then, as a long-term side effect the brain gives the smoker a release of pleasure hormones known as D, which in turn creates a craving for more of the smoked product. When you continue to smoke and beat the cravings, over and over, you eventually form a physical addiction to nicotine.\nTobacco smoke is often made of cigarettes but also can include cigars and pipe smoke or chewing tobacco. Smoking is increasing lung disease, lung cancer, heart disease and a number of other medical conditions.

This renewed interest in the topic has prompted physicians to change their views on the underlying causes of Fibromyalgia and offer an alternative diagnosis. If this is the case, you\u2019re not alone.\n\n## Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling?\n\nSwelling in the hands is a common symptom of Fibromyalgia. This symptom may be due to impaired fluid output by the lymph nodes, which are located in the soft tissue under the skin. It can occur in any joint but is most common in the smaller joints. It can vary in severity and is dependent on several factors, including the stage of the auto-immune disease.\n\nOne of the most common complications of Fibromyalgia is swelling of the joints. Aside from aching joints, it can also affect the hands, ankles, and knees. Many patients take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat these symptoms, but this may result in a large quantity of fluid retention in the soft tissues.\n\nFibromyalgia can cause swelling in the ears and hands. The problem may worsen when the temperature changes. In many cases, the swelling is temporary and disappears within a few hours. The swelling may affect only one or both arms, but it can also affect one or more hands, too. A lymphatic tissue procedure or lymphatic drainage massage may be able to decrease the swelling and increase blood flow.\n\n## Does Fibromyalgia cause pitting edema?\n\nIt is not uncommon for Fibromyalgia sufferers to experience swelling in their hands, feet, and abdomen. The symptoms are caused by fluid retention and poor lymphatic circulation. The swollen area can range in severity from mild to severe and can signal a variety of health problems. However, some people may experience pitting edema without any health issues.\n\nThe cause of the swelling may be related to faulty adrenal glands, lymph drainage, or blood clots. Therefore, treatment may involve addressing these root causes.\n\nSwelling of the hands and feet is also", "It\u2019s one thing that I seem to notice come and go with my flares. Ugh! Swelling in the hands, feet and ankles\u2026nothing like it to make you feel better.\n\nMy wrists seem to be the least of my problems.\n\nAnd swollen necks!

A fear that you might need or have actual arthritis.\n\nWhen this starts nourishing and growing its fearful tentacles, it will first start to quietly bring you little gifts. Like ankles that aren\u2019t swollen, only half. You will not really have to show them to anyone (not at first) But then it becomes a numerous symptoms throughout your body.\n\nAnd then the experienced bodysmart fibropatient (check this post) is forced to start going back to their doctor and this time they are very clear that they want an x-ray or a bone scan.\n\nI also have yet to meet a person with fibromyalgia who hasn\u2019t seen a rheumatolocist \u2026but I salute each and everyone of them as I have managed to avoid that particular CPA (Crazy Painful Arsehole).

The very first place on my body that swelled up was my knee. My healthy knee without any previous injury swelled up. Until then, I have never had any knee pain in my life. The swelling in the knee was total sudden for me. My husband was the one who noticed the swelling in my knee first. I can\u2019t feel it, because it was swelling without me noticing it. It was painful too. The pain spreads to my stomach every time I stood up suddenly. The swelling also started to go away slowly, but it repeatedly and came back within a few weeks.\n\nThe doctor didn\u2019t tell me the name of my disease at that moment if I was diagnosed with a disease. The doctor just told me that I had swelling in my knee due to fibromyalgia. I can\u2019t believe what I heard. I know so many fibrofog created by fibromyalgia causing forgetfulness for everything including my own disease. I always forget the discovery of my disease and I always share the same experience too.\n\nThe fibromyalgia was confirmed, but fibromyalgia is a contagious disease and the swelling in the knee just comes back over and over. I visited my doctor in in March 2019 and she said it appeared that my condition was caused by swelling. I also have heart palpitation, so she thinks my heart is sick. Swollen knees over and over cause heart palpitation and aqueous humor is common. Do you know what it is? Yes, hydrated water. Hydrated water? Don\u2019t panic, hydration helps your body to transport and remove the toxin in your body. The water that your body lacks because of low blood volume can cause hydrophilic tooth decay. More than forty years of medical experience is involved in the treatment. You can 100% trust them.\n\nThe more information I get, the more I desire to know. I was so curious about where the pain in my knee came from. Nothing in my joint is so good. The knee is connected to the bone and the ligament. The bone was injured to get the toxins out. I have never heard of it but there is a possibility of injury to the bones of the knee. So, I want to confirm that it might be possible", "Fibromyalgia causes widespread body pain which often mimics swelling. If your hand was swollen, and you have a metallic object inside, you\u2019d be able to feel it just by touch, same as you are able to feel the body\u2019s pain signals even the cause of it is not necessarily inflammation.\n\nSwelling is an example of inflammation and inflammation is the body\u2019s protective and healing response to injury, infection, or toxic threats. The swelling is caused by fluids being retained in the tissues.\n\nIn Leptomyositis and Lupus, the actual fluids caused the swelling. During these conditions, the Tissue Enzyme is incomplete and requires the Water Enzyme to complete it. The actual swelling is caused from excess fluids being trapped in the tissues because of an imbalance in the Tissue Enzymes.\nSwelling can also be caused from the body trying to dilute toxins. This occurs in most every situation where the tissues have been injured, infiltrated by a virus, or toxins have settled in the tissues creating a toxic situation.\n\nIn Fibromyalgia and many other situations, the symptoms are due to Trapped Nerve Energy (TNE). Trapped Nerve Energy is always caused by an imbalance in \u2013 either the Moved Enzyme or the Tissue Enzyme. Energy is always trying to flow in a specific direction. Each Enzyme always likes to \u201cOwn\u201d its territory, who they interact with, and the direction they flow. An imbalance of the Tissue Enzyme forces it out-of-balance, and causes the Moved Enzyme to \u201cown\u201d the territory. If there isn\u2019t perfect alignment, the Trapped Nerve Energy will fill that void.\n\nOkay, now is probably the perfect time for someone to ask: If there is an imbalance in the Tissue Enzyme, why did fibromyalgia and CFS start in the first place?\nThe Tissue Enzyme imbalance doesn\u2019t cause the disease. It is a symptom of the disease. Science does not have any further answers to this question. Neither do I. Each time we ask this question, we always are told about an infection, a virus, some food, something over stimulating the immune system. Maybe a stress-", "Does your body ever feel swollen? Sometimes when some women feel their muscles swell in a few spots or even in their entire body (with very minor swelling) shortly after menstruation, the condition is commonly called as FM (Fibromyalgia). It\u2019s not cancer nor sickle cell disease and it may also be \u201cwater weight\u201d or how water-weight is called in medical terms, i.e., retention of water. If you have Fibromyalgia, you should ask your doctor about this phenomenon, because water weight is temporary, and it\u2019s not the basis of menstruation. Swelling is like \u201cwater\u201d in your body.\n\n## Does Fibromyalgia cause swelling in your body?\n\nMYTH: Swollen bodydue to Fibromyalgia?\n\nThe Medical Explanation Here is an example to demonstrate my own perception of the notion. Your body has 700cc of tissue fluid (the water in our veins and arteries), and 1500cc of interstitial fluid (the water between cells). If your Fibromyalgia is getting worse, then the swelling in your body will increase. It will go on for a couple of days and then come back again until you get over it. So, you will never be able to tell what percentage of swelling is actually in your body when it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nMost Fibromyalgia patients are doctors in the field of pain management. Others are physical therapists, or nurse practitioners. It\u2019s just that most of them are not aware that their bodies are loaded with positive ions that can cause swelling, thus causing pain. Their oxygen and water content needs to be replenished all the time. Where do these ions come from? Well, your blood. Where do oxygen and water come from? From oxygen ions. It\u2019s an endless cycle.\n\nSome doctors check for allergies and reactions to certain substances that can cause retention of water due to the body\u2019s reaction to those substances. Fortunately there are inexpensive test kits available to help with diets and allergy relief. What if you are allergic to something? You should always be aware of that so you can be aware of what\u2019s happening inside your body."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3721, "rouge1_r": 0.08, "rouge1_f1": 0.1317, "rouge2_p": 0.119, "rouge2_r": 0.0251, "rouge2_f1": 0.0415, "rougel_p": 0.3256, "rougel_r": 0.07, "rougel_f1": 0.1152, "bleurt": 0.5517, "bert_score_p": 0.8356, "bert_score_r": 0.8849, "bert_score_f1": 0.8596, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4186, "rouge1_r": 0.0525, "rouge1_f1": 0.0933, "rouge2_p": 0.0714, "rouge2_r": 0.0088, "rouge2_f1": 0.0156, "rougel_p": 0.2791, "rougel_r": 0.035, "rougel_f1": 0.0622, "bleurt": 0.3959, "bert_score_p": 0.8086, "bert_score_r": 0.8615, "bert_score_f1": 0.8342, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4419, "rouge1_r": 0.0537, "rouge1_f1": 0.0957, "rouge2_p": 0.0952, "rouge2_r": 0.0113, "rouge2_f1": 0.0203, "rougel_p": 0.3023, "rougel_r": 0.0367, "rougel_f1": 0.0655, "bleurt": 0.2799, "bert_score_p": 0.7837, "bert_score_r": 0.8562, "bert_score_f1": 0.8183, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3953, "rouge1_r": 0.0428, "rouge1_f1": 0.0773, "rouge2_p": 0.0476, "rouge2_r": 0.0051, "rouge2_f1": 0.0091, "rougel_p": 0.2558, "rougel_r": 0.0277, "rougel_f1": 0.05, "bleurt": 0.2987, "bert_score_p": 0.8003, "bert_score_r": 0.8528, "bert_score_f1": 0.8257, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4186, "rouge1_r": 0.0514, "rouge1_f1": 0.0916, "rouge2_p": 0.0476, "rouge2_r": 0.0057, "rouge2_f1": 0.0102, "rougel_p": 0.2791, "rougel_r": 0.0343, "rougel_f1": 0.0611, "bleurt": 0.3117, "bert_score_p": 0.7917, "bert_score_r": 0.8561, "bert_score_f1": 0.8227, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4651, "rouge1_r": 0.0573, "rouge1_f1": 0.102, "rouge2_p": 0.0476, "rouge2_r": 0.0057, "rouge2_f1": 0.0103, "rougel_p": 0.2558, "rougel_r": 0.0315, "rougel_f1": 0.0561, "bleurt": 0.3033, "bert_score_p": 0.8011, "bert_score_r": 0.8559, "bert_score_f1": 0.8276, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

Even in the absence of cancer, our blood contains millions of such cells that regenerate, which is how a tooth pull or a cut heals. But this regenerative process involves precise instructions, some of which cancer uses to its advantage and make the same, abnormal cells. This causes uncontrolled growth, creating new and often \u201cdifferent\u201d malignant cells.\n\nThis process of cancer is unique to each patient, in other words, the source of the abnormal cells in your brain may have the same signature as the cancer in many other people (e.g., breast cancer), but it\u2019s different because each source is different. Now, if a cell is removed (say, via a biopsy), it starts to grow on other people and create a new cancer there. That is one easy way cancer may spread through blood \u2013 via swapping sources for the \u201csame kind\u201d cancer that was not there but starts to grow once cells from source cancer begin to grow on other people.\n\nBut is this how cancer typically spreads?\n\nMy view is: not at all. Below let\u2019s see why \u2026\n\n## Mechanics Of Blood Flow In A Human Body\n\nWhen you say blood, you have to think blood flow! That is, the blood inside your body is, by and large, flowing through your arteries and veins.\n\nWhen you ask if cancer can spread through blood contact, I assume (correct me if I am wrong) by blood contact you really mean blood flow since you exclude direct contact.\n\nUnless you place a blood bag in your skin, you cannot begin to think of, say, touching a blood vessel, and allow your blood to flow there. It\u2019s either you couple a capillary or get severely injured to see any effect, and the consequences won\u2019t be as trivial as a mere spread of cancer cells (here statistic for contaminating blood from blood bags).\n\nThe diameter of a blood vessel is something like 3 millimeters for a big artery, that\u2019s a little thinner than a pencil.\n\nAssuming one would surpass the artery\u2019s protection, that", "Does Email Virus spread by touching the envelope of an email?

On the other hand, blood is one of the mediums in which cancer cells travel. There are chances of spreading cancer by the donation of blood or organ transplantation.\n\nFor any disease, the possibility of spreading by direct contact is quite low, as the agent of transmitting the disease should be present on the surface of the body. For example: Hepatitis A occurs by coming in direct contact with poo(fecal matter). Yellow fever spreads by the mosquito bite and diarrhoea spreads by eating food contaminated by raw food or cooking water.The same applies to Cancer.\n\nIt is not communicable through direct contact of blood and saliva. But, the chances increase if the cancer is spread through blood contamination such as blood transfusion and transplantation.\n\nCan Cancer spread through blood contact?\n\nThe girlfriend of famed singer Justin Bieber \u2013 Hailey Baldwin was allegedly diagnosed with Lyme disease. In an interview, she came forward and explained the disease and how you can contract it.\n\nLyme is an autoimmune disease that manifests its symptoms in a rash-like formation around the area of the tick bit. However to remove and kill the bacteria (Borrelia) that causes Lyme disease, a person has to undergo a course of antibiotics, the length of which depends on how severe the infection is.\n\nThere is no official evidence of Lyme in India. But as per doctor Jennifer Chubinski, of University of Toronto, in Canada the infection can be transmitted to humans via a tick bite from the \u2018scientist tick\u2019, also known as Ixodes scapularis. Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam also have a marked distribution of certain disease pathogens in specific vector systems.\n\nCan cancer spread through sexual contact?\n\nCancer spreads into our body in different ways, and spreading cancer through sexual contact is one of them. Some people have potentially infectious or contagious cancers. They mean they do not spread easily from person to person, but can, and those cancers as: vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and cervical cancer", "It is well known that cancer can spread through the blood, as well as some of the viral agents responsible for carcinogenesis. With viremia, the virus spreads through an infected person\u2019s blood to healthy people, resulting in acute infection. Anthrax represents an example of this mechanism wherein the germ B. anthracis is carried within the blood. The pathogenic organism enters the bloodstream rapidly, arriving in the brain and liver in minutes, once it is transmitted through the blood. Inside the body, acute anthrax is highly transmissible. A fact that leads to anthrax doing the same through contact with blood from dead bodied animals, even if they are not contaminated with the bacteria. The sources of anthrax in these cases would be the dead animal\u2019s blood, causing lethal infections in healthy animals that cross the poisoned blood. Anthrax can also be transmitted through insects that went in direct contact with the animal or the animal-human relationship itself.\n\n## Can HIV be transmitted through contact?\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus is transmitted through contact with other individual\u2019s blood or semen. When it is related to sex, unprotected oral, vaginal or anal intercourse can transmit the virus. Also when the orifices are already mucilaginous, making an injection with a contaminated needle can cause the pathogen to spread through the blood, or directly through an unprotected and altered mucosa.\n\nIn children, HIV infection usually occurs immediately at birth from mother\u2019s breastfeeding. In most cases, the child is not impregnated with HIV, but contracted in situ, having contact with the mother\u2019s blood, and not through breast milk (which contains fewer viral particles). In other words, when the infant is still in the breastfeeding position, the HIV infected mother\u2019s saliva has contact with her mouth. The infant swallows the microorganism through the average feeding time, contracting the disease. It was demonstrated that when feeding in this position, the babies have a small number of contact with the blood of the infant, but have a higher exposure to accumulated microorganisms in the environment where the baby is usually feed. Other forms of transmission could also be caused through blood, blood transfusions and sexual intercourse.\n\nDo broken capillaries bleed cont"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.359, "rouge1_r": 0.0359, "rouge1_f1": 0.0653, "rouge2_p": 0.0789, "rouge2_r": 0.0077, "rouge2_f1": 0.0141, "rougel_p": 0.2821, "rougel_r": 0.0282, "rougel_f1": 0.0513, "bleurt": 0.5062, "bert_score_p": 0.7825, "bert_score_r": 0.8352, "bert_score_f1": 0.808, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5641, "rouge1_r": 0.0571, "rouge1_f1": 0.1038, "rouge2_p": 0.0526, "rouge2_r": 0.0052, "rouge2_f1": 0.0095, "rougel_p": 0.359, "rougel_r": 0.0364, "rougel_f1": 0.066, "bleurt": 0.3154, "bert_score_p": 0.7856, "bert_score_r": 0.8385, "bert_score_f1": 0.8112, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.359, "rouge1_r": 0.0409, "rouge1_f1": 0.0735, "rouge2_p": 0.0263, "rouge2_r": 0.0029, "rouge2_f1": 0.0053, "rougel_p": 0.2308, "rougel_r": 0.0263, "rougel_f1": 0.0472, "bleurt": 0.28, "bert_score_p": 0.7679, "bert_score_r": 0.8265, "bert_score_f1": 0.7961, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.7179, "rouge1_r": 0.0755, "rouge1_f1": 0.1366, "rouge2_p": 0.2632, "rouge2_r": 0.027, "rouge2_f1": 0.049, "rougel_p": 0.359, "rougel_r": 0.0377, "rougel_f1": 0.0683, "bleurt": 0.2929, "bert_score_p": 0.7926, "bert_score_r": 0.8761, "bert_score_f1": 0.8323, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6154, "rouge1_r": 0.0665, "rouge1_f1": 0.12, "rouge2_p": 0.1053, "rouge2_r": 0.0111, "rouge2_f1": 0.0201, "rougel_p": 0.359, "rougel_r": 0.0388, "rougel_f1": 0.07, "bleurt": 0.3161, "bert_score_p": 0.7937, "bert_score_r": 0.8522, "bert_score_f1": 0.8219, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4872, "rouge1_r": 0.0518, "rouge1_f1": 0.0936, "rouge2_p": 0.0526, "rouge2_r": 0.0055, "rouge2_f1": 0.0099, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.0354, "rougel_f1": 0.064, "bleurt": 0.3659, "bert_score_p": 0.7889, "bert_score_r": 0.8463, "bert_score_f1": 0.8166, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

It is a condition of inflammation of plantar fascia, which is a band of ligament-like tissue that runs through the bottom of the foot from the heel to the toes. Because of the heel bone, this tissue is enclosed and stiffer with more foot\u2019s weight.\n\nPlantar fasciitis develops when this soft tissue is strained, thus creating inflammation, microtears, and even small ruptures of plantar fascia. The heel pain results when plantar fascia is strained by walking or standing, especially first thing in morning after waking up. For many people it happens again when sitting for long and then getting up immediately.\n\nAnother symptom of plantar fasciitis is not limited to pain alone, but it can also cause:\n\n- Attachment development at the fascia\n- Achilles tendon rupture\n\nCauses of Plantar fasciitis\n\n- Inflammation or degeneration (tears and micro ruptures)\n- Deposition of calcium crystal (heel spur)\n- Increased tension on the foot arch, which is associated dextrose technique, hyperpronation, and inefficient foot function.\n\nTreatment\n\nOnce diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, the primary treatment focuses on relieving pain, symptoms, and reducing the transition time of plantar fascia so that it will not break more. This can be done through:\n\n- Physical therapy \u2013 Physical therapy is certainly the best treatment for plantar neurosis that involves:\n    - Stretches\n    - Massage therapies\n    - Strengthening the legs\n    - Barefoot walking\n    - Night splint\n- Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is a low intensity treatment that has shown good results. It involves delivering a shock wave directly to the damaged nerve roots, which helps in relieving pain, chronic inflammation, and symptoms of plantar neurosis.\n- Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is very effective especially when there are tears of plantar fasciitis. In fact, it even has the greatest impact on promoting new creation and healthy tissues of the ligament.\n\nPrevention\n\nSimple fitness", "Every year in California, millions of dollars are spent on podiatry (foot) services for shoes, ankle braces, orthotics, crutches and ongoing therapies. More than 2.7 million Americans visit their doctor every year because of a foot problem, according to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 agency, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.\n\nAt The Permanente Medical Group, plantar fasciitis is one of the most common conditions certified family, adult and pediatric foot specialists treat. This condition is complicated by its frequent misdiagnosis.\n\nHome and away, foot problems and pain are frequent complaints. But is it plantar fasciitis or one of the many other types of foot pain?\n\n## What\u2019s plantar fasciitis?\n\nThe plantar fascia is a band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot connecting your heel bone and your toes. When the plantar fascia becomes torn, it causes a shoe-like guard called the plantar fascia to grow on the bottom of the foot, giving the foot a pumpkin-like texture, and causing pain when you put your weight on it.\n\nIn severe cases, a person with plantar fasciitis experiences a rupture in the band of tissue (plantar fasciitis) connecting the heel bone and the toes. There is fluid-filled blister, which requires several weeks for healing to occur as full-body fluids are re-balanced and contained within the bladder for proper metabolism.\n\nIn mild cases, a patient with plantar fasciitis feels mild discomfort and can improve symptoms in a matter of weeks with substitution of dipyridamole mg, ipilimumab mg or sansapril mg. However, without treatment, the condition will worsen with the accumulation of toxins in the repeated compartment.\n\n## What Happens to People with Plantar Fasciitis?\n\nWhile plantar fasciitis is most commonly associated with runners, the condition can also affect people with a degenerative hip joint or chronic hip pain. It is also associated with arthritis.\n\nTwo studies found plantar fasciitis was associated with psoriatic arthritis, a type of arthritis that affects the feet and legs", "I have had it for years. Drinking alcohol, eating bread, sugar, etc. makes it worse. I don\u2019t feel like these help: cushioned insoles in shoe, stretching, icing, heating, massage, tennis ball rubs, non-steroidal anti-inflamatorey medication, etc. Other than the occasional steroid injection which decreases the pain temporarily, what else is available that science/medicine suggestns works well?

Abscesses are most frequently due to bacterial infections of the tooth. Although they can lead to serious illness, they do not cause heart attacks \u2013 as this article notes, that is caused by coronary artery disease, which is itself caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and smoking, among other things. The risk of heart disease increases with age to the point that it occurs in most people who live long enough. Weakening or plaque buildup within the heart\u2019s blood vessels (coronary heart disease) provides the spot for the blood clot to form and risk of a heart attack(1).\n\nThere are many serious and potentially life-threatening concerns of abscess tooth infections than heart attacks, but in rare cases, heart attacks have been reported to occur with an abscess tooth. The heart and organs are all in the body, so it makes sense that any problems that can affect the abscessed tooth could affect the heart as well. In rare cases, the abscess has caused death or required open heart surgery to repair it.\n\nOne such study noted that the heart is susceptible to dental infections, reiterating that the cause of death from the abscessed tooth was from a heart attack. They conclude that the dental infection may have been bacteria, and may have traveled to the heart through the bloodstream. In conclusion, this does not provide evidence of a causal link, as this is a rare form of death due to a dental infection. These reports illustrate that people are not likely to die from cardiac arrest complications following the diagnosis of an abscess dental infection. Of note, cardiac valve vegetations and pericarditis \u2013 two very serious conditions which could have been the cause of the heart death \u2013 were not present on any of these patients.\n\n## Can an abscessed tooth cause a stroke?\n\nWhile it is definitely possible, an abscessed tooth can cause a stroke, a visit to a dental professional in advance of the abscess is probably the best call.

The study\u2019s authors discovered that the pilot factors associated with gum disease might cause most of the risk factors connected with coronary heart disease.\n\nThe findings of this study show a direct link between cardiovascular disease and gum disease. According to the authors, \u201cThe existence of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors such as diabetes, HIV, hypertension and dyslipidemia, are linked with a greater level of gingivitis and periodontitis.\u201d\n\nExactly what this implies is the fact that inflammation in the mouth isn\u2019t only about the teeth; it\u2019s about the entire body and all of your organs \u2014 even the heart.The mouth is the most important service entrance to your body and making the right decisions about your health starts there.\n\nAs a shakeology reviewer, part of my job is to find out the pros and cons to the shake.

It is a blood disorder that cause death in the greater part of the time. It can affect the entire cardiovascular system. \u201c\n\nA tooth abscess and endocarditis vary, but not completely. To determine these health issues, you must identify its type.\n\nThe basics of both are around the heart. An infection of the tooth is distinctive only because of localized signs and symptoms which affect the tooth or the tissues around that tooth, but in the case of endocarditis, there are whole-body signs and symptoms.\n\nThe prognosis of both diseases is different. A tooth abscess can prevent the root canal procedure, but it is not a life-threatening condition like endocarditis.\n\nThe diagnosis for a tooth abscess can be very simple. If there is an amount of infection, a dental X-ray can show you the extent of the infection.\n\nAn endocarditis can be detected earlier when you have endocarditis in your heart.\n\n## Difference between an abscess on a tooth and one on the brain\n\nthe main difference is that the abscess( infection) on the head can cause or", "Teeth are mostly hard tissue, though some people have had jawbone tumors such as osteosarcomas, or cancers such as ameloblastomas or kerato-acanthomas or, rarely, a severe cancer of the jaw bones which is characterized by hard, bony swelling with teeth in a region of the jaw. A recent study of nearly 44,000 cancer patients showed that the jaw bones can often hold cancers of other organs within them.\n\n## What causes teeth to abscess?\n\nDental problems can have various common causes, such as dental crowns (also called persian anchors) and surgical implants in the teeth which have been done repeatedly or for a long period of time. Other causes can be tooth decay, loss of vitamin D from a disease such as rickets, and even seizures and cancer.\n\nWhat can I expect in test results after my tooth abscess is detected?\n\nAn abscess tooth can cause your abdominal area to become swollen or painful as an oral abscess forms in the upper part of your body or just below the gumline where they pain is located. An abscess tooth can sometimes be treated or cured for a period of time before an abscess can develop. There is often a link between an abscess, especially in the mouth, with other oral problems such as diabetes mellitus, gum disease and tooth decay, which can either cause or aggravate a tooth abscess in the mouth.\n\n## How to tell if you have an abscess in your tooth:\n\nThere are several ways to tell if you have an abscess developing in your mouth. An abscess can form either because it is located in the jaw bone, mouth tissue, or even upper or lower part of your time than what is visible in the mouth. If you are an older person with a mouth that is in good condition, you may be able to identify some of these common features to look for.\n\nSome of these features are also indicators of other conditions in the mouth such as mouth sores, sore throat pain in the mouth, discoloration in the mouth, or bad breath in the mouth.

It touches on a critical clinical problem because the approach to patients with blackouts is different. Those that meaning blackout in the sense of loss of consciousness have a much higher risk of life threatening events, seizures and strokes.\n\nStatistics\n\n1.It is a world-wide epidemic problem and is common in all societies and among all the ethnic groups.\n\n2.The incidence and prevalence of syncope vary with the definition of syncope. According to the consensus achieved in the International Syncope Workshop (ISW), syncope can be thought of as either:\n\n\u00b7A sudden transient loss of consciousness and/or postural tone associated with the onset of cerebral ischemia or other cause or\n\n\u00b7A sudden transient loss of consciousness and/or postural tone, retention of the sleep-wake cycle, recovery within 1 hour or less, and return of normal cerebral function.\n\n3.The annual incidence is 1% to 2.5% in the general adult population.\n\n4.It complicates 5% of all hospital admissions worldwide and an even greater proportion of hospitalizations for cardiac disease or neurological dysfunction.\n\n5.Approximately 2 million people a year highlight complaints of fainting within the medical establishment.\n\n6.It is estimated that one in 200 people are diagnosed annually with syncope and have taken a detour to the emergency department or a clinic.\n\n7.Incidence increases with age and the overall mean annual incidence is 94.5 per 18,350 person years.\n\n8.In neuro cardiology foundation  study reveals that physicians consider", "This is a condition characterized by short-term loss of consciousness and cognitive awareness\n\nTable of Contents\n\n### What is Syncope in a Nutshell?\n\n- A common word called vasovagal epilepsy fainting is more common in term teenagers during pregnancy and is also known as ischemic syncope.\n- The loss of consciousness was transient and spontaneous in this condition.\n- Spontaneous is not effective technically in the routine life of patients and often prevents falls of those with sympathetic predominance.\n\n### Syncope Definition\n\nThe term syncope is used to identify a neurologic condition in which someone deliberately fades away consciousness for a small part of time. You may have a headache, feel sick, tired, or feel dizzy even loss to consciousness, lose control over the bladder and bowels.\n\nThis loss occurs due to decreased oxygen pressure or disruption of blood vessels in your brain. It will cause vertigo in an individual. Apart from being a headache and mental disability, there is a sharp knees down feeling while missing to consciousness.\n\nIt is also called as unconsciousness which is dangerous. It should be recognized that unconsciousness people cannot control their bladders or (anus).  What is the most striking factor of this entity is that this can happen mainly due to circumstances because sometime unconsciousness people just have fainted due to withstanding long time in a sitting or standing position (mainly due to the blood circulation concern).\n\n### The cause of Syncope?\n\nIf the deoxygenation of brain cells prolongs for an extended time and suffer from low oxygen pressure the person often dies. To measure blood supply happens loss of consciousness. May be smaller unusual flow of blood. After the brain suffers from insufficient oxygen flow is dulled or unconscious.\n\nThis feeling well often too long so about 2-10 minutes. This sudden lack of awareness can be fully recovered. Then he becomes anxious often results in unconsciousness which is completely sudden. It is not resulted from accidentally any conditions of the drug. A sudden loss of brain oxygen pressure can cause the person or cardiac disease, irritation or bradycardia. As the person becomes unconscious, other complications will have encountered.\n\n### Main Symptoms of Syncope\n\nOne can often have a severe headache if you have lost your entire consciousness and eyes begin to close and become listless", "Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot blocking an artery that supplies blood to the brain.\n\nAccording to 2021 data, approximately 1 of every 17 deaths worldwide results from ischemic stroke.\n\nWith ischemic stroke, it\u2019s important to act fast and receive medical care as fast as possible.\n\nDon\u2019t panic but act promptly.\n\nWhat Causes an Ischemic Stroke\n\nIschemic strokes result from blood clots or debris from clots that break off and form, leading to a blockage of a blood vessel carrying blood to the brain. plus a decrease in or absence of blood flow to a certain area, which causes the death of brain cells in that area of the brain.\n\nSometimes the vessel narrows slowly over time, not raising any flags, they are often not noticed until it is too late, and the vessel becomes blocked, blocking off the supply of blood to the brain.\n\nBecause clots occur when substances that are normally found in the blood, like fibrin, add together, certain conditions can make it more likely that blood clots will form.\n\nWhen this occurs, the pieces can break off into the bloodstream and travel to vessels leading to the brain.\n\nConditions that increase the risk of Ischemic Stroke\n\nHere are some medical conditions that increase the risk of ischemic stroke:\n\nWhite matter hyperintensities (small vessel disease). Narrowed or blocked arteries in the brain.\n\nTemporary interruptions in the supply of blood to the brain, known as transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or mini-strokes, are one type of microvascular disease.\n\nA persistent decrease in blood flow to a major part of a brain is known as a larger infarct, a type of stroke that is the result of a larger vessel disruption, an acute vascular condition, and an emergency. As the blood vessel supplying blood to the immediate area becomes blocked, it dies, leading to permanent brain damage.\n\nCarotid artery disease.

The patient may attempt to move about, squeeze something (such as an empty bottle), hit something or another person. A plethoric or pale condition may be noted.\n\nPostural Hypotension\n\nWith respect to postural hypotension, the patient in orthostatic hypotension is unable to compensate for normal, systolic blood pressure changes on standing up compared with an individual without hypotension. Autonomic nervous system failure is also present in postural hypotension.\n\n### Definition of Syncope (Isohemic Stroke)\n\nFurthermore, the term is used with or without the modifiers ischemic. syncope, in an aetiological sense refers to a transient loss of consciousness due to a lack of oxygen to the brain.\n\n- Familial du down syndrome syndrome (FDS), a pre-onset form of Down syndrome.\n- Often; lunch is spoken of as a syncope, of the prandial rhythm.\n- A syncope is also defined as a short period of unconsciousness caused by fainting or loss of heart function.\n\nDefinition of Syncope\n\nBrain tumor- A brain tumour or brain neoplasm is a shortage of brain tissue in the skull.

Coenzyme is composed of twenty amino acids which should cause no harm to an individual. Interestingly, during research carried out to analyze ingredients of Coenzyme it was revealed that one of the\ningredients is itraconazole, an essential component of anti-fungal medication, as a main ingredient in the treatment of ringworm. In the lab, a product containing high levels of itraconazole exhibited anti-fungal activity. This also makes one wonder how amino acids found naturally in foods could show these effects as a drug.\n\nThe point being, if a product is sold as a drug and has not been certified by a licensed health expert/professional, one should be wary of its legal status in his/her country or region as well as its possible impact on your health.\n\nDr. Nizar Abdo A. Asghar\nDirector \u2013 Halal Certi\ufb01cation Authority, Islamic Food & Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA)", "by Brother Zeeshan Ahmed\n\nI study biomedical sciences and have seen that Coenzyme Q contains pork extract. Is it forbidden (haram) according to Islam, because there are fatty acid substances which are derived from working on pig fat (liquid). And is it haram or halal if it's red or in capsules?\n\nIn the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n\nAs-salamu `alaykum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh\n\nI hope this finds you in the best of health and spirits.\n\nCoenzyme Q10 is a vital compound used by all cell in the body to convert nutrients to energy. It is found in very high concentration in the mitochondria (organelle) of cells. There is also a tightly controlled genetically directed manufacturing process in the body which can generate coenzyme Q10 from items found in the food we eat.\n\nThere has been increasing evidence in the field of biomedicine which suggests that in some patients, Q10 levels fall to very low levels. This situation occurs mostly in heart patients, and in cancers of the lung and liver. This has resulted in the introduction of Coenzyme Q10 supplementation, or Q10 pills as they are known, by doctors. This occurs with the general consent of the patient.\n\nMany companies have jumped onto this quest for improvement, and Coenzyme Q pills are available in fields as diverse as body building, fitness and as stand-alone therapy for a host of ailments.\n\nWeb-sites also sell these pills on the Internet, often with little scientific background articles, popularizing these pills as a treatment for a host of problems as diverse as Alzheimers and liver disease. So popular have these pills become that in a handsome amount of research papers published every year, there are several papers devoted to testing the effects of the pills. The jury still remains out on many of them.\n\nI doubt if there is a fatty acid content in them which may pose a problem for Muslims, but I cannot vouch for the tablets in which they are manufactured. Also please bear in mind that there is no known pollution of the supplements under these circumstances, so if you use standard supplement sold by companies who assure purity, you are fine.\n\nThere is", "Asked by Swati.\n\nHi Swati!\n\nCoenzyme consists of enzymes such as vitamin b (thiamine), nicotinic amide, vitamin B12 etc. used as nutritional supplements. These supplements are added with food and are often prescribed if there are any vitamin deficiency symptoms observed.\n\nSo by adding these in your diet, you can add up the daily nutrients with a balanced diet. This is the basic aim these co-enzymes are designed for.\n\nCoenzymes are often available as powder format in bottles in combination with vitamins and other nutritional supplements to enrich our diet in the right way. Many supplements are available today claiming of treating some specific illness but they actually work when you are having proper food.\n\nFor Muslims, these coenzymes are considered as food that are not haram under sharia law anyway. So in this case, there won\u2019t be any conflict of law as we consider these as food only. Vitamins, in general, are also counted as food and these are bona fide.", "Response:\n\nThere is a drug called MAO inhibitors. The action of MAO inhibitors are explained in some Muslim medical jurists books about such drugs. MAO inhibitors agents are a group of drugs (including isoflavansides, tranylcypromine and others) known for suppressing the activity of an enzyme called Mono Amine Oxydase.\n\nMAO inhibitors causes two known side effects.\n\n1- If the patient is on dietary tyramines (especially in nourished and nutritious foods), such as aged cheese, chocolate, certain red wines, and for some who drink alcohol frequently, because these two agents raise the levels of Tyramine (tetraminet), and may cause Peptic Ulcer type 1 if too much Tyramine is causing even bit lowering of pressure in the aerial blood vessels. On the other hand if Tyramine is increased, this increase compulsorily makes the aerial vessels lowered (low blood pressures), so much that Peptic Ulcer type 2 could cause death. If MAO inhibitors is taking before consuming dietary Tyramine, it will treat and control both High and Low blood pressure.\n\n2- It might cause a serious and rare type of mental disorders, such as mania and confusion known as Mao syndrome.\n\nMAO inhibitors treatment process is potentially lifetime until the symptoms are completely removed from patient\u2019s experiences in life, even though the syndrome might have been started after years of taking MAO inhibitors.\n\nThe explanation of the above phenomenon is without offense, the pure manner of Haram that these people are doing.

Not one disease but many are more likely to be caught because of acknowledging sensitivity and translation from one system to another system.  Identifying symptoms that can tell another story or indicate the beginning of the attack is important.  Many auto-immune diseases affect multiple parts of the body.\n\n## Which autoimmune disease affects the skin?\n\nNaturopathic Doctors work for the patient to identify the subtle and abnormal changes or reactions that would not normally occur in the body. Hives, extra freckles, loss of pigment or rashes are very likely indicators that something else is going on in the body.  Much like an \u201callergy,\u201d the body may react with a rash to a food, substance, or smell.  Naturopaths know that the body is first trying to say something is wrong.

Erectile Dysfunction may be due to a number of different factors, but many people think that drugs are a big cause of it. Most people think that what you eat and whether or not you have diabetes factors into the equation. While these are many of the suspected reasons for the decrease in desire, some experts say that other things such as stress, fatigue and even the weather can play a role.\n\nTips To Avoid Using Lighting For Erectile Dysfunction Remedies\n\nThe first step is to recharge your batteries. Many men these days are suffering from ED, which is Erectile Dysfunction, due to the stress of their jobs. Their brains have been conditioned to spend long hours in front of a computer. This long hours spent in front of the computer have caused a high cholesterol level which reduces the amount of blood flow to the genitals.

Some studies suggest that the active ingredients in Effexor could increase the risk of erectile dysfunction conditions due to the effects that Effexor have on the brain\u2019s serotonin levels. This is due to the idea that serotonin could play a role in sexual function. It is thought that when levels of serotonin are too high or too low this can decrease sexual response and subsequently could be the cause of ED.\n\nThe most likely cause for Effexor causing ED is that many patients who have erectile dysfunction conditions also suffer from anxiety and depression. Facts show that depression can greatly increase the likelihood of suffering from ED as they come hand in hand. Many antidepressant medications can lead to sexually dysfunction due to the causes mentioned above.\n\nGenerally, If you do take Effexor and you find out that you will likely suffer from ED then you should take necessary precautions such as seeing a doctor. There is not a lot of information out there, but it is best to be as informed as you can be about the medication you are taking, and its possible reactions. According to clinical trials that were done with a specific drug for the treatment of premature ejaculation many patients were unable to prevent their ejaculatory response which led to clinical ED. The product, priligy was not approved in the United States, but an alternative is priligy online.\n\nOne way to prevent this is to do alternative treatments to avoid ED altogether before taking Effexor if the possibility is present. It would also be important for those who are suffering or may potentially suffer from ED to gain a knowledge of the wide range of alternative treatments that could help deal with these issues.\n\nHave a look at these now: https://www.sexualhealthbreakthrough.com/category/sexual-health-books/\n\nOne of the Treatments that could potentially help is the duration treatment or treatment of quick relief. Sex or masturbation consistently over a few weeks/months is a treatment type that has become popular among men who suffer from ED. This is due to the fact that those who suffer from this dysfunction can suffer even more if they do not satisfy their partners in the bedroom. These treatments benefit both partners and allow for a more fulfilling sexual relationship. If", "Dolan and Sharp (1996) studied dosage effects and found that 375mg of Effexor given daily had minimal effect on erectile function. In another study, 21% of the Effexor group developed ED compared to 10% of the placebo group, but the cause of ED was related to interruption of ejaculatory function.\n\n```\nBetween 10 and 88% of patients diagnosed with cancer experience sexual problems following diagnosis and treatment.

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression.

A and F.\n\nFor AS, I have always typed it with upper case, and never capitalized it.\n\nAS stands for aortic stenosis.\n\nTo understand what AS is, it is helpful to write the full term aortic stenosis, which is not Aortic Stenosis but should be Aortic S (note the small letter \u201cs\u201d before the word stenosis).\n\nThis becomes easier to say if you say it normally, but I find it easier to remember if you say it abbreviated all together,\n\nNow for ARD.\n\nAR, F.\n\nA and F. There is a murmur of bothness in the aorta (the aorta is the large artery coming off the heart).\n\nSo when I see a patient with a murmur of bothness, how could he have both,\n\nBetter term, AFD (which is venomous (A and F stand for Aorta and F is Few, or a few words).\n\nNow for BAV valve.\n\nMany educated people think that the BAV stands for Bicuspid Aortic Valve, and it should not. This term is a misnomer. Finally, the BAV should be associated with Marc atrioventricular valve for Bicuspid Aortic Valve because BAV does not clearly mean that the BAV has a bicuspid aortic valve, nor can it be deduced that the MR is a bicuspid aortic valve.\n\nIn addition, there have been many articles published, in medical", "I\u2019m 61 years old, in good health, and physically active. But my echocardiogram recently showed the valve between my heart\u2019s main pumping chamber and aorta \u2013 known as the aortic valve \u2013 was over 60% obstructed by calcium buildup and is also moderately regurgitant. The echocardiogram also showed a small form of out-pouching, or aneurysm, by that same valve. I was advised to see a heart specialist.\n\nI know there\u2019s a procedure called TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) in which a smaller valve is inserted through a thin tube (catheter) without surgical cutting. I\u2019ve looked at pros and cons of TAVR, and have seen many reports about postprocedural complications including some deaths. Do you know of any comparisons of outcomes between doctors who perform lots of these procedures versus those practicing in communities like mine (Missouri)?\n\nAge 61 and Active in Missouri\n\nDear Age 61 &Active,\n\nAortic stenosis is a common valve disease among elderly patients and it can be serious, without a cure or even a maintenance drug on the horizon. Compared to mitral valve disease, which is more common among women and younger women, aortic valve disease is more common among men older than 60. As you know, the aortic valve lies between the left ventricle of the heart and the aorta that distributes blood throughout the body: it is the valve you feel as you put your hand over your chest bone and listen to a murmur.\n\nThe most frequent cause of aortic stenosis is \u201ccalcific aortic stenosis,\u201d in which a process of calcification of the valve leads to the valve leaflets to come together \u2013 like hands cupping, or coming together as you squeeze a tennis ball. A slightly less commonly encountered cause of aortic obstruction is a rotary valve motion disorder, in which the valve lobes spin instead of opening up, leading to a Doppler systolic click under the valve. Finally, milder degrees of aortic stenosis may result from what\u2019s called \u201cprimary aorta regurgitation\u201d: the aortic root,", "\u2014S.\n\nAortic stenosis, also called aortic valve stenosis, is a condition in which the blood-flow in or out of the heart is blocked due to a narrowed aortic valve. The aortic valve is a critical organ through which the chambers of the heart (ventricles) pump blood into the extra 7 billions capillaries throughout the body that carry nutrients to all the cells.\n\nA normal aortic valve has three leaflets.  A well-working aortic valve is also able to adapt its size to the amount of blood being pumped out by the heart.\n\nAortic stenosis is caused by a narrowed aortic valve and can occur for various reasons. These include:\n\n- Calcification, in which calcium is secreted in the leaflets of the valve, (the affected segments get stiffer)\n- Genetic defects that in the ability of the valve\u2019s internal leaflets to adapt\n- Problems with a heart valve from a previous heart operation or congenital heart disease (birth defects).\n- Structural problems (Various reasons such as infectious processes, mitral valve prolapse, and rheumatic fever are found to possess risk for aortic stenosis later in life)\n\nAs aortic stenosis progresses the body will adjust by speeding up the heart rate to compensate. The heart will often beat erratically to increase the output of blood-flow through what is available. Symptoms of aortic stenosis include exercise limitation, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, palpitations (irregular or pounding heart beat), and fainting episodes.\n\nThe hardness of the calcification narrowing in aortic stenosis will take time to develop. Procedures can be done to widen the narrowed valve or even replace the defective valve. Depending on the degree of heart failure, patients who can not get better can urgently require an emergency operation to prevent death.\n\nAortic stenosis is best identified \u201caccidentally\u201d through medical screening procedures, electrocardiograms (ECGs) or echocardiograms (ultrasound heart scan). The actual fact of aort", "Aortic stenosis happens when the opening in the aortic valve becomes narrower because of calcium build-up. When the valve doesn\u2019t open as well, blood has a harder time flowing through the valve and the rest of the body. The valve becomes too hard for the heart to pump all the blood it needs through the body, and, over time, the heart becomes weak.\n\nIf aortic stenosis is left untreated, the pressure on the heart to make sure it pumps blood properly to the rest of the body can cause the heart to swell, press down on the body structures around it, and eventually stop working.\n\nFor women age 80 and over, aortic stenosis is the most common acquired heart defect.\n\n### What are the risk factors for aortic stenosis?\n\n- Age\n- Family history\n- Congenital issues\n- Rheumatic fever or rheumatoid arthritis\n- High blood pressure\n- Kidney or thyroid disease\n\n### What are the signs/symptoms?\n\n- Pain in the back and calves when walking/exertion\n- Dizziness\n- Chest and shoulder pain\n- Weakness\n- Heart murmur\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, it\u2019s important to see a doctor immediately. If left untreated, aortic stenosis can be life-threatening. When discovered in early stages, aortic stenosis can be treated by medication, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\n### What are the tests used to diagnose aortic stenosis?\n\n- Physical examination (your doctor will listen with a stethoscope to check for a murmur in your chest)\n- Blood tests (to rule out other causes of your symptoms)\n- Echocardiogram (this test lets us see your heart structure and how it\u2019s working; this will show us if your valves are abnormal)\n\n### What can I do to help prevent aortic stenosis?\n\n- Eat a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and trans fat.\n- Eat fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet.\n- Maintain a healthy weight throughout your life so you don\u2019t become overweight or obese.", "So Mary asked a question to AJMC TV, which many of you have been asking as well.
