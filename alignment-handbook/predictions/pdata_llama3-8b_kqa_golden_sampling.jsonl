I was on Zoloft for a year and it worked great but I had to stop because I got pregnant. Now I'm on Lex and not really sure how it's working. My doctor said it would take 4-6 weeks to work. Is that true?", "also I've been taking it since like 2 months ago today so does that mean my brain has adjusted to it already or can it still take longer.\nSorry I don\u2019t know any info about lexapro as I\u2019ve never had it. But I started 4 lexpro and 150 mg of welburtrin and I just was feeling depressed and low my dr switched me to 10mg of wellbutrin an 50mg Lexpro. So I guess my doc and or pharmacist thought I needed another medicine for depression along with wellburtsn as they both don't treat. I would say it's time for a little longer. If your a smoker it may take months and not till that time you feel better. You may want to ask your Dr.\nI've heard that its really good with the whole smoking thing. so if I am still feeling kinda \"eh\" on the depression scale do I need to talk to my doctor? or do we wait a bit longer? and also do you know if there are any side effects I have to be worried about?\nNo im not on any smoking meds just the welli and lex. The lex is not only for smoking just all around depression meds. Not sure if it helped with my smoking. Only my mind set. In 7 months I haven't smoked 1 cigarette. Don't worry about side affects as everyone is different they might be different for each person. Sorry I couldn't be more help.\nOhh what kind of medications did you take for the quit?\nI have a lot of anxiety about things. This is what drives me crazy when your trying to quit and smoking gives you a calming effect. Plus I'm really picky about how things taste. A lot or chewing gum. Did you chew?\nWell I really wanted to get off anti anxiety meds when I quit as that's what I used to feel calm. Since my quit I took anti-arrhythmia. (I forget the drug name) as well as anti-insomina and antacids for two weeks and well that was enough. Didn't need any other smoking addiction medication. Started Zoloft just in case a month ago. Now I chew sugar free gum, but I do miss smoking when Im nervous or feel stress - but not the need for any medication to fix it.\nThanks so much for your insight I hope that my medicine works well too. Just got the call today about them changing my dosage", "How it works and what it treats. Lexpro - (escitalopram)\nLexapro is an SSRI antidepressant. SS-RIs, like lexapro, work by increasing levels of the chemical serotonin in the brain.\nLexpro is a ssri\nLex pro can cause some serious side effects! Lex pro and the medication that causes it can actually cause a person to have some terrible side affect's from the use of this. I want to talk to you about the serious effects that can come from this and why you need to be wary of using this medication.\nHow lexpromedication is taken and how to take it safely!\nLexpromeds come in two different forms\nFirst form\nThe first form Is the one that is available over the counter. This is the version that most doctors recommend for people who haven't been on a form of antidepressants or whose condition doesn't qualify for the more powerful forms of lexpor. The first method is to ingest the med. through the nose by putting them inside the nostrils or through your mouth. By putting the tablets inside your nostril, you are breathing out of your nose which is how the drug enters the system.\nThe second form is used when you have been diagnosed with an actual disease that needs to treat. Sometimes this happens when a patient is under an intense amount of stress. When the patient gets to a certain point, their body is filled with stress hormones called catecholamines. These catecchallamines are then released into the bloodstream where they start to work.\nWhen the catechochalamines are released they are converted into a chemical called glutamate which increases the amount that the cells secrete and also makes it so that more cells are needed to perform certain activities. They are also converted by another chemical in your body called serotonin which allows them to change from having an effect only on one cell to acting on many. In other words, the activity of glutamine in cells is dramatically increased when exposed to high levels. It is this activity that brings about a lot of things in our body. One such occurrence is that it makes cells produce a substance called 5 Htrp.\nThis substance then makes neurons produce more of one of their important neurotransmitters that produce serotonin. As you can see now you know that there is not only an increase in serotonin production within the body; it is also caused by the increase of these other chemicals. There are different types of 4", "Is it an SSRI like Celexa and Prozac?\nLexapro is a better drug than celex then I have found.\nYes it is an anti-depressant in the SS/NI class, like celecta. And the two anti-oxidants I mentioned (Piracetam, ALA) should really make a difference in this kind of depression.\nLexpro is also known as Cipramal over here... i was on this drug for a year before my head shrink decided to up the dosages, i had started to get some side effects after a while due to me taking it at the maximum dosing. i eventually got kicked off it because i guess it did not work for me... but in saying that it makes me feel like i am floating when i'm on it i think i just took it for the wrong reasons, maybe it's meant for mild depression? i dunno... not sure why my doc perscribed it to begin with, well i do remember, she said i have mild anxiety but i dont think she persribed it right.\nI find that lexapro does work but only after two weeks or so. I had one week of just horrible and then it was smooth sailing. Just remember its hard to judge your depression/anti-deprssants with a little baby that doesn't want to sleep. There are lots of ups and downs with kids.\nIt's pretty nice to be off everything though\nI took Ceclax for over a month and a half because of the horrible mood swings I was having and feeling. But all I could tell is I feel no difference at all, really. No more moodiness and no improvement. So if you don't really notice any changes, then don;t stay on a medication you're not comfortable with. If it works for you, that's great.\nSo far I've been on lexpro for about 1 12 years. Started on 10mg then went up to 20 mg. Have gone through some minor side affects from the meds. My advice don,t give up if it does not seem to give the effect you want right away or in a few days. You may need a small period of time to adjust to it. One thing I recommend to everyone who's taking lexopro is to take it in divided doses. In other words take 5mg morning and night. Most people have no side effect from 4mg or less", "What is the best form? Capsule or pill? And do I have to be on it for a long time?", "Also how long do you usually have to be on it?\nI'm sorry I'm not a huge fan of meds.\nHowever Lexpro is a very famous antidepressant that does work wonders!!\nPlease note that like all medicine, we should NEVER just go and do it unless our doctors prescribed it for us. But this is just my view point.\nI was once on 15mg of lefluproxine, and i have tried 20mg before the dose increase i went on them 3 times, now after going through withdrawal from the 10mg dose I now find myself at a total stand still and I am now thinking that I will try the lexapro this week. Has anyone had this happen to you? Just stopping and starting back, its like how people are and how your on the top of the word and feel like a super star then fall back to the bottom of a grave. This is like that. How long does it take a person to become the old self when your taken leflixapron?\nIf they aren't working go off Lex, as they can make matters worse!\nMy psychiatrist didn't like the Prozac and the Cymbalta because he thought they caused manic symptoms and they didn;t work for me. So they took me off both and now I have my old Doc again I'll try Lex and see if this really does help.\nAlso just out of curiosity about these antidepressants, is one of them better than another? What is the point of taking antidepressents if some are not as good as others?\nMy doctor suggested the generic Cipralex, which also helps you sleep like no other drug in the sky and it's very effective.\nSo does this drug make u feel happy and stuff?\nDepends on your situation.. if you're suffering a lot from it, the antidepressment can help you out."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1406, "rouge1_r": 0.2727, "rouge1_f1": 0.1856, "rouge2_p": 0.0079, "rouge2_r": 0.0154, "rouge2_f1": 0.0104, "rougel_p": 0.0938, "rougel_r": 0.1818, "rougel_f1": 0.1237, "bleurt": 0.2768, "bert_score_p": 0.844, "bert_score_r": 0.7991, "bert_score_f1": 0.8209, "hallucination": 92.85714285714286, "comprehensive": 9.090909090909092}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4297, "rouge1_r": 0.1294, "rouge1_f1": 0.1989, "rouge2_p": 0.0472, "rouge2_r": 0.0142, "rouge2_f1": 0.0218, "rougel_p": 0.2109, "rougel_r": 0.0635, "rougel_f1": 0.0976, "bleurt": 0.2758, "bert_score_p": 0.7849, "bert_score_r": 0.8063, "bert_score_f1": 0.7955, "hallucination": 85.71428571428571, "comprehensive": 18.181818181818183}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4375, "rouge1_r": 0.1333, "rouge1_f1": 0.2044, "rouge2_p": 0.0787, "rouge2_r": 0.0239, "rouge2_f1": 0.0366, "rougel_p": 0.2422, "rougel_r": 0.0738, "rougel_f1": 0.1131, "bleurt": 0.3212, "bert_score_p": 0.7958, "bert_score_r": 0.8266, "bert_score_f1": 0.8109, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 72.72727272727273}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.1561, "rouge1_f1": 0.2379, "rouge2_p": 0.0787, "rouge2_r": 0.0244, "rouge2_f1": 0.0373, "rougel_p": 0.2344, "rougel_r": 0.0732, "rougel_f1": 0.1115, "bleurt": 0.2982, "bert_score_p": 0.802, "bert_score_r": 0.8294, "bert_score_f1": 0.8155, "hallucination": 71.42857142857143, "comprehensive": 36.36363636363637}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.0547, "rouge1_r": 0.35, "rouge1_f1": 0.0946, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0469, "rougel_r": 0.3, "rougel_f1": 0.0811, "bleurt": 0.199, "bert_score_p": 0.8254, "bert_score_r": 0.7914, "bert_score_f1": 0.808, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3828, "rouge1_r": 0.1536, "rouge1_f1": 0.2192, "rouge2_p": 0.0157, "rouge2_r": 0.0063, "rouge2_f1": 0.009, "rougel_p": 0.1875, "rougel_r": 0.0752, "rougel_f1": 0.1074, "bleurt": 0.2725, "bert_score_p": 0.8014, "bert_score_r": 0.8159, "bert_score_f1": 0.8086, "hallucination": 85.71428571428571, "comprehensive": 18.181818181818183}]}

In addition, it is impossible to determine if you have pneumonia based on your description of your symptoms and the age of the individual. Most respiratory viruses last about 3-4 weeks. The pneumonia viruses are a subset of this with some individuals having symptoms less than 2 weeks, some 4-12 weeks and more in rare but special circumstances.

But are they the only way?\nA team of scientists set out to answer that question. They found that the droplets (responsible for coughing, sneeze or talking) don't just fall to the ground but stay in the air in indoor environments. Their findings suggest many respiratory droplet-borne infections are transmitted via the so-called 'airborne route', in which they may spread from one patient to another through contaminated air. The airborne route is thought to account for a large fraction of respiratory contagion, for example, by transmission from patient A to patient B. However, the exact mechanisms by which this occurs remain unclear.\nTo find out, a team led by Dr. Cheng Liu from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University examined the airborne transmission of three types of bacteria in different indoor and outdoor environments.\nWhen people breathe, talking, cough or sneeing they exhale microdroplets and aerosols that carry pathogens. These aerosol particles (APs) quickly evaporate to become less than 5 \u00b5m in size; this is similar to how breathing a fog leads to condensation on a window and you are left with water droplete all over.\nThe team found the amount of water left behind in APs to be roughly ten times that in direct dropplets and they also tended to take longer to evaporated.\nThey showed how these air-bourne AP particles are particularly hazardous because they can float around in air for extended periods, with low air flows of as little as 10 cm/minute.\n\"The results show that when we talk about AP transimission of infectious diseases, we can not just focus on dropllets or aerosoals, but we must also consider these mixed dropper-particle mixtures. Furthermore, even people who don''t talk when they cough and don''''t cough when the talk, can actually be releasing airborne AP droproplets. This is largely due to breathing and evaporation through the mouth, though the effect is much reduced when people are standing upright.\"\nThis suggests that talking can lead to significant dropped contamination, particularly if people stand upright, as in many indoor workplaces and classrooms.\nThis research provides clear and detailed evidence to support the widespread application of personal protectve equipment in certain kinds of indoor environment.\n\"Airborne AP transmission is particularly important in", "What does it mean? Is my respiratory disease contagious? How is it transmitted from one to another?\nA respiratory tract infection is contagious when it involves contagious pathogens that are transferred from contaminated individual to healthy individual. Some contagious diseases are highly contagious such as measles whereas some diseases such asthma or pneumonia are not considered contagious in the present scenario. The respiratory illness is commonly passed from individual-to-individual through droplet secretions from coughing, sneezing or respiratory droplets which cause infection. It can also be passed through nasal secretory substances, mucous, sputum and dust particles and other body secretional fluids through sexual intercourse, contaminated environment through airborne mode.\nThere are many respiratory infections reported by the patients that includes bronchitis, sore throat, nose congestion, common cold, pneumonia among others. For further analysis, a doctor has to conduct complete blood investigations and body fluids to confirm the exact cause of the patient\u2019s disorder. If the cause has been confirmed to be of contagious mode then appropriate treatment is to keep the infected individual away from healthy population until the infection has recovered. This is recommended precautionary step to prevent or reduce the transmission of illness to other individuals.\u00a0\nFor more information:\u00a0 Is bronchiectasis infectious: Can it be transmitted\nWhat Is Molds, Symptoms, Causes, How to Remove Moulds, Prevention And Treatment For Molders\nHow To Prevent and Treat Flu \u2013 Best Way To Fight Influenza\nRespiratory system and related diseases\nAre you searching for a treatment for lung disease?\nWhat are the treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?

However, cough, sore throat, and fever can be due to infections, such as the cold (respiratory virus), flu, sinus infection, bacterial, viral, strep throat or fungal. It is also important to check if the throat is red and swollen, if it can cause a pain in swallowing or if cough can produce sputum. If the above mentioned symptoms accompany fever, it\u2019s better to stay at home and consult your doctor.\nShould I tell my employer and my workmates?\nInfluenza viruses have the ability to spread through the air from coughs and sneezes, so it is best to inform your employer about your situation. That way, other people can take precautions and the spreading of virus can stop. In order to keep you isolated from others, you can have additional protective measures applied \u2013 using separate entrances and exits, changing the rooms, wearing mask and gloves. You have to be sure that you have your flu confirmed by a medical worker.\nWho should stay home? Can I bring my child to work if he or she has a runny nose or an ear infection but is not too sick for childcare?\nSick child should not come to childcare and you shouldn\u2019t bring him to the work place.\nChildren that can infect other children due respiratory infections (and fever or sore throats) that require antibiotics are usually children under 2 years of age. After the age of 1 or 3 years, children are less likely to get an infection and have serious symptoms. Still, they might have respiratory viruses that do not go away after a few days \u2013 so if your child has been coughing for more than 10 days, he should see a doctor. Also, ear infections may seem to disappear, but they can still make your kid miserable. As they usually disappear after 7 days of taking antibiotics, make sure to finish the entire treatment. Otherwise, the infection might return. There are also people who may be more likely suffering respiratory illnesses, like asthma \u2013 even if they haven\u2019t taken any flu vaccines. This is caused by the fact that asthma affects their airways, making them narrower and reducing airflow.\nWhat respiratory or cold viruses are the most contagious and when should I stay isolated?\nIf you"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1639, "rouge1_r": 0.1613, "rouge1_f1": 0.1626, "rouge2_p": 0.0167, "rouge2_r": 0.0164, "rouge2_f1": 0.0165, "rougel_p": 0.1148, "rougel_r": 0.1129, "rougel_f1": 0.1138, "bleurt": 0.2576, "bert_score_p": 0.8329, "bert_score_r": 0.8384, "bert_score_f1": 0.8357, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.377, "rouge1_r": 0.0657, "rouge1_f1": 0.1119, "rouge2_p": 0.0333, "rouge2_r": 0.0057, "rouge2_f1": 0.0098, "rougel_p": 0.2459, "rougel_r": 0.0429, "rougel_f1": 0.073, "bleurt": 0.2833, "bert_score_p": 0.787, "bert_score_r": 0.826, "bert_score_f1": 0.806, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.2131, "rouge1_r": 0.0861, "rouge1_f1": 0.1226, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1311, "rougel_r": 0.053, "rougel_f1": 0.0755, "bleurt": 0.222, "bert_score_p": 0.7864, "bert_score_r": 0.8214, "bert_score_f1": 0.8035, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5738, "rouge1_r": 0.0862, "rouge1_f1": 0.1499, "rouge2_p": 0.05, "rouge2_r": 0.0074, "rouge2_f1": 0.0129, "rougel_p": 0.3443, "rougel_r": 0.0517, "rougel_f1": 0.0899, "bleurt": 0.3361, "bert_score_p": 0.7843, "bert_score_r": 0.8495, "bert_score_f1": 0.8156, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.541, "rouge1_r": 0.0982, "rouge1_f1": 0.1662, "rouge2_p": 0.1167, "rouge2_r": 0.0209, "rouge2_f1": 0.0354, "rougel_p": 0.3115, "rougel_r": 0.0565, "rougel_f1": 0.0957, "bleurt": 0.2999, "bert_score_p": 0.7878, "bert_score_r": 0.8728, "bert_score_f1": 0.8281, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.6885, "rouge1_r": 0.0995, "rouge1_f1": 0.1739, "rouge2_p": 0.1333, "rouge2_r": 0.019, "rouge2_f1": 0.0333, "rougel_p": 0.3934, "rougel_r": 0.0569, "rougel_f1": 0.0994, "bleurt": 0.3014, "bert_score_p": 0.8005, "bert_score_r": 0.8663, "bert_score_f1": 0.8321, "hallucination": 55.55555555555556, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}
{"Question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "Free_form_answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.

There are also two types genital herpes, also known as HSV. In this article, we are going to explore the differences between these four STD\u2019s.\nSexually transmitted diseases usually take place between those who are sexually involved, although there\u2019s an option of infection without being in an adult relationship. The symptoms of these diseases may be visible with the bare eye, but also could happen without displaying any sign whatsoever. Since there aren\u2019t any visible symptoms, it\u2019s not a bad idea to get tested once in a while, as well as being careful during sexual activities. Here we\u2019ll also explore how you could detect if someone has any of the following STD\u00b4s.\nHUMANA\u00ae HPN\nHPV is short for human papillomavirus. According to the CDC, more than 150 forms of genital HPV exist, many of which infect the genitals and can cause cervical or anal cancer. Symptoms of this STD include warts on the neck, head, and genital area. Not everyone who\u2019s infected with HPV will develop warty growths. Additionally, those worts can be easily transmitted to others, which can make sex risky for those at an elevated risk.\nCervical cancer is caused by HPV types 16 and 18, according to experts on National Cancer Institute. HPV 35 and type 6 are the most common ones. Approximately 80% of sexual active people become infected by those strains at least once over the course of their life. And up to 90% clear genital wapts naturally in two years. Only when genital papiloma (warts) or cervical abnormalities are detected, HPV diagnosis becomes a must.\nHPVs are passed usually by direct genital contact and oral sex. It can also be transmitted non-sexually from mother to baby at birth.\nThe Genita Herpe Virus\nThere are two common kinds of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV 2. HSV can pass via genital and non-genital area, affecting every part of your body including the skin, genital, lips etc. However, the main difference between both types is that HSV1 usually infects the mouth and the face, while HSV2 affects the genital region. When HSV is visible, werty growth is typical in the case of HSV", "HPV has no cure and you have to live with it for the rest of your life. Genitals herpes is also a virus but it has a cure (valtrex)\nHello there, I am not a doctor. I just live and have experienced a lot of stuff.\nHere are facts.\nHerpes is a lifelong virus. It can\u2019t be cured.\nYou can suppress herpes with medication (you can take the pill regularly to prevent cold sores or you can even take daily pills to stop sex)\nWhat is herpes\nA virus that is carried by almost 80% of the world\u2019s population; herpes virus infects the nervous systems of both animals and humans. There are 8 varieties of herpes simplex virus (HSV); 5 are found in humans, and the varicella- zona virus, which is the virus responsible for chicken pox and shingles, is another. Herpes virus 1 and 2 is responsible to most herpes outbreaks. The virus is commonly located in the genital areas, face, mouth, lips, legs, buttocks (or anus). It manifests itself as either cold sore blisters on mouth or genitals. People with recurrent genital herpes experience a tingling sensation before the eruption.\nWhat causes herpes?\nThe virus lives on nerve cells and cannot reproduce without those cells. Once inside of a human body, the infection is for life, although it could be symptom free for extended periods of time. One can get the herpes infection through contact with someone that has the active virus.\nHow is HSV transmitted?\nHSV \u2160 is transmitted by contact and can be passed through kissing or sharing of eating and drinking utensils. HSV \uff01 \u01a4 is usually contracted through sexual intercourse, during pregnancy, or during childbirth. While pregnant women with active infection have a rare risk of transmitting the disease to their babies during both delivery and through vaginal secretions, they can also cause painful oral soars in babies if they breastfeed them.\nSymptoms of HSV\nCold sore signs: redness, swelling, blurring, tingles\nHerpetic gingivitis \u2013 painful gums\nChewing or swallowing may be difficult\nBlisters in mouth and on lips\nThe pain is most severe when colds sore are in their active stage, after they crust over they typically fall off within a week but scars can linger after the blistens are gone.\nGenital Herp\u0113tis signs:\nHerpeic lesions on or around the vulva, vagina, rect", "There\u2019s a lot to learn, so let me give it to you straight.\nThis month we\u2019ve talked about the difference between STD testing and STD screening, and, now, we\u2019ll talk about what you\u2019ll learn if it turns out that you have HPV; not to mention the big difference with Herpes as well.\nHere\u2019s the main difference: herpes cannot be tested for; it can only be identified clinically. HPV (Human papillomavirus) can be accurately tested through blood testing \u2013 that\u2019s because HPV and genital herpes differ in other ways, too. The first difference is that herpes can lead to serious disease and even death if left untreated, while with other STDs, the disease can lie dormant for many years and eventually be cured \u2013 or not even need to be treated. With herpes, many people live with it for years.\nHerpes spreads more easily than most people realize \u2013 in fact, a person will be able to tell if they\u2019ve contracted herpes only during the \u2018active\u2019 stage of this STD, which is what is known as the outbreak cycle. At this time, genital sores in the form usually of red bumps will break open to crusty soars.\nThere are two primary herpes viruses:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HSV-1, aka Oral herpes\nHPV can also be contracted or transmitted as a result of sexual relations with an infected partner. When this happens, you and your partner will more than likely be asymptomatic, or have no symptoms whatsoever \u2013 which means that having oral, anal or vaginal sex with your infected spouse could get you infected. It\u2019s possible to have more that one type of HPV \u2013 this is so because there are over 100 types of Human papilloviruses around.\nIt\u2019s true that HPV is often asymptotic and will go away on its own.

Let me tell you the results of your biopsy first then explain the findings to you.\nA biopsy confirms the initial clinical diagnosis of leukoplakia \u00a0(chronic inflammation of mucosa).\nThe next question is what is causing this inflammation?\nA high viral load in your mouth and lack of immunity. In this case the causative factor would be HHSV 1 (herpes simplex virus). It is not a case of suppression of HSV by your body. There is simply too much of it in there and your immune system is unable to control it. You must remember how powerful this virus is and how it evades the best immune responses.\nWhat treatment is indicated in this situation?\nFirst and foremost, treatment of infection by H HSV 2. If this cannot be done then the infection may never be eradicated. This means your dentist cannot remove the leukoplastia only to have it come back a few days later. Unfortunately, the antiviral medication required for this takes several months of regular dosage to achieve the necessary reduction of virus.\nIn the long term with treatment, this would eradicate the viral replication that results in the oral ulcera and lesion.\nThen, with your ulcer, yes there is medication available for that (it is called an ulcer gel) as well as a strong mouth wash to reduce the bacteria and kill any H. Pylori that may be present.\nYou may like to go back and follow up with the doctor and discuss if he can prescribe a course of an antihistamine and painkiller\u00a0 that can keep the pain down until a full treatment regimen is worked out.\nRemember, herpes has a tendency to come and go. It may not ever completely disappear.\nI am concerned about how much these conditions are affecting your quality of life, and we will be here for you if and when you ever need to speak to us.\nHave a question for Chris? Email him!\nIf you found this helpful, please subscribe to receive my articles by email!\nIf", "What if the herpes virus is in the air. I told you my whole life story on this blog, but what it boils down to is this: I thought I was being smart about sex. It was not my first or second or even tenth time having sex with a new partner, or multiple partners. Do you need to tell anyone if you find out that you may have herpes? I think so, especially in a committed life-partner type of relationship in which STDs could be a deal breaker.\nIt is also more common. About of both women and men in America contract HSV-2 every year. This is not just a disease that effects teenagers. In fact two-thirds of the women between 14 to 49 have HSV, not including HSV that was contracted at birth. Is it possible for you to get the virus you don't already have? Is there a way for the HSV virus to transmit via saliva or skin-to-skin contact? In other words, can someone who had never been infected with any kind of herpes, get sick from oral kissing someone with HSV? It would be interesting to know whether oral-to-genital transmission of HSV is possible, since I've heard of people who've never even been exposed to HSV contracting it from a sexual partner through genital-to-oral transmission.\nI would probably get more from this information than any other. And is it rare? The first two years of my marriage we only managed to make love one or two times a year due to our religious convictions. So the most intimate thing we ever did, before or since, was hug. Hugging and kissing.\nThe rest is ancient history now. The biggest factor is the type. HSV1 is much more likely to be spread via a kiss. If she has the active virus, then yes. That said, this is probably more of a health issue than a relationship one.\nSo there's a possibility she could get it during oral. When I got married we were both very active in our churches but there really were no rules about hugging or kissing. As long as we did not feel like humping each other, we could cuddle or hug or kiss whenever. At that time we had both already had herpes but that didn't seem to matter. My husband has herpes 2.

Thanks in advance for your experience!\nIt's been almost 14 months since I've taken the Lexipro, which is really helping my sleep problems. This month, in addition to my pain meds during the day, and my sleeping meds at night, I also have added Zanaflex (tizanidine) for muscle pain/spasms. It was my doctor's suggestion.\nI tried the Z drug that's most often prescribed for Fibro and it had the opposite effect than what I needed. I went from not sleeping to sleeping a lot. Not good! So my Fibromyalgia specialist prescribed Lyrica. In combination with a muscle/nerve relaxer and a medication which I no longer take due to its side effects, it seemed to work pretty well for a while. Then it stopped working and the only muscle and nerve medication that worked was methocarbamol, but it left me so doped up I couldn't do anything. So I decided to go back on the nerve/muscle medication because I felt that Lyric was the culprit of me no long getting the right sleep and when my nervous system wasn't responding right, no amount of sleep would help me. My doctor switched my muscle medication and he's had me on Baclofen (lioresal) which seems to be working at this time, for the most part.

I am thinking of trying it to see if it will help.", "?\nHome \u00bb IDEA Answers \u00bb Any thoughts or personal experiences on activated carbon as far as helping w a stomach/virus/etc?? I saw it at a holistic drugstore so wanted some guidance on using it.\nHere is a list of possible uses, but the main purpose is to treat poisoning and overdose on drugs. I see no point in using charcoal when there is an acute illness, however when someone is having a lot of vomiting, one tablespoon of charcoal can help control the vomiting. But there's a drawback to using this method that you should know before trying it. Taking a substance that's used to counteract poison could be dangerous and cause your body to become more toxic, and might interfere with treatment or diagnostics if you go to see the doctor.\nIt's not a cure-all, it's meant to get things out. It's really meant for the poisons people take on purpose.\nSome drugs like antacids take advantage of its ability to trap certain molecules because it removes them from the body.\nActivated charcoal is made from organic matter and is processed to increase the number of tiny pores that give it its enormous surface area. The porous charcoal traps the molecules in its tiny cracks and thus \"binds\" them (i.e. it chemically forms bonds with them). Think of it like an \"anti-drug.\"\nActivated carbon is commonly used in hospitals to reduce drug toxicity through ingestion. If you or someone you know eats something poisonous, get some (preferably some specifically recommended for ingestion) and have them take as much as they can as soon as possible. Charcoal is essentially a filter for your stomach, trapping poison molecules to be flushed out by the next bowel movement. In this way, activated carbons are the same as activated aluminas, although the properties of porous activated materials can often differ significantly in the way that they attract specific molecules and in their chemical reactivity.\nA few years ago I took activated Carbon as an immediate antidote for poison. For 4 hours after poisoning I did not eat anything and took a liter of activated black carbon liquid. After a while, my stools came out black and this helped to remove the toxins out of my system. Before I started with the charcoal liquid my face was yellow, after several hours the skin color of the face, hands, etc. returned to the norm.\n1. A virus isn't poisoning you - you need to eat the proper foods to strengthen your immune system, not kill a symptom.\n2. Activated", "I've also been drinking activated mineral water but I heard it's supposed to be helpful for stomach ailments.\nI can't say that we ever tested charcoal on this, but that being said it seems like something that would work.\nWe have a product called Cleanse by Renew Life that was developed by a naturopathic doctor from the UK. It actually contains activated, purified bentonite clay and activated carbon. They have 3 products.\nThere are different products called Super Clean and Max Clean that come in tablets that are taken at the onset of a stomach ailment. You can take 2 tablets of Super Cleaner for children and 4 tablets for adults.\nSo what you suggest is to take it when you start to feel a little sick. For some reason it doesn't necessarily work if you take too many after the fact.\nThe second product they have is CleanSE Detoxify Drink which is a pleasant tasting beverage which contains a proprietary blend of activated bentanite with activated carbo, along with psyllium husk and pectin to bind toxins, and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidoplus and Lactobaicillus plantarum) to rebalance the digestive flora.\nWhat are your thoughts if they've been through the stomach (i.e. they started to cause some blockage) and you are taking them in pill form? Are they still effective? Should you not give Activated Charcoal pills if that is the case?\nWhat about if the dog is vomiting? Will the activated Charlcoal cause more vomiting until the block has been pushed through? Also, is there a concern if vomiting and the charcoal are together?\nOur lab has found that if dogs have gone through 24 hours or more with a severe food or drug reaction, that you can usually re-start that process again even after 36 or 48 hours. But if it has gone more than a week, then usually your pet has not lost it. So we would give it maybe another week and see if he goes down the path again.\nIf you notice a significant reaction to the meds, which we often do with pets who have never been on the type of medication that they are now -- and a lot of times that's the reason that the family is giving it -- then they will often react with some vomiting/diarrhea. Those would be signs -- along other signs that a reaction might have occurred -- that might tip your off to get to a vet and possibly", "My DS has had diarrhea so bad he gets cramps and hasn't kept water/milk/soup down the whole day despite me giving him 4 oz every hour (and holding every 6 mins for a while). He's not 2 yet, just 8 months and only weighs about 10 lbs. His temperature hasn' t been high, but he feels clammy and cold. It's hard to hold a bottle or pacifier in his mouth in between vomiting. I'm concerned because he hasn. The charcoal, and 3 days of no solid food and water only. And I would only give every an hour if he didn't take it. If he wasn't dehydrated he wouldn want it.\nHe's on IV fluids if your not concerned about his electrolytes and dehydrate, maybe you can get some charcoal for him if it gets to the point where he's getting a little weak from not getting enough fluids in, not sure if his immune system can handle the charcoal at such a young age, he doesn't have an infection so if that's something to worry yourself with, I think giving charcoal when a child is a 12-18 month with a stomach virus is fine, my guess is the younger they are the more at risk taking it is for them and the risk of a GI bleed too.\nI've never given him activated carbon before and I dont know if I could because I worry about GI bleeding from charcoal. But I had never heard of giving it to kids when they have a virus, so I thought maybe it could help. He just got back from the hospital 18 hrs ago with IVs. Even though he vomits immediately after, it seems to relax him a bit until the effects wear off.", "I have never taken it before. I did take activated silver which may have helped but I am not sure. Any thoughts appreciated.\nI\u2019ve had both but never at same time. Only once silver has cured all symptoms within 24 hours (2 years ago). I\u2019m taking it at the moment for parasites (along with all the other remedies for them and the silver). So, no, I do not know.\nNot had one of these in years now but when I had it several decades ago, activated sliver cured me in 5 hours. It was terrible, but in the next day with my silver dose twice a day, my body seemed to throw it out of me, leaving no trace.\nThe problem I see with Silver is this: For what you want silver to do, it works on a very small area which is very good. The thing about it is that even at what they say is a safe level (8 drops once a week or 4 drops twice week), even then that\u2019s not safe and not an optimum level. You have to take more often than that to see the benefits you are looking to obtain from it. So you have a problem there. Then you need a good colloidal machine to produce it yourself which most have not. Even if you do you still have the problem on your machine breaking down due to its high alkaline nature. And on top of all that, you also have bacteria in your water that also inhibits the production of the nano-colloids, which Silver has to be for maximum effectiveness.\nMost use a little bit of what is considered safe but they do so only once or twice weekly, and to what benefit? When really, is it enough to really notice any long term benefits? And yes, they are still using it, so I would say not.\nActivated charcoal will also help to draw out impurities from the body but it has a different mechanism. As per your comment above, there probably are more toxic agents at work in addition to whatever microorganism you got bitten or swallowed.\nCharcoal removes toxins from wherever you've swallowed it by physically trapping them in it's granules.\nSo if it touches anything that is inside your body, including blood, its action will work against anything harmful there.\nSilver is quite another thing. Not many people know this, that its real action happens inside the cell. How it gets into the cells at all is also unclear. Some are happy with that though as it does seem", "It helps me feel better.\nI am trying to wean my kid off the \"suck your thumb\" habit.

This vitamin is also essential for healthy eye development in", "There is an increasing amount of interest regarding luten and Omega 6 and 9 and their beneficial effect on the human eyes and how they work as an antioxidant protecting the eyeball from harmful free radicals.\nLuten is a carotenoid and is found in high amounts in some plant-based food items such as spinach, green cabbage, broccoli, and green peas. The main source of lente (or luttene) is yellow and orange fruits and vegetables such a carrots and sweet potatoes. Omega fatty acids are the body\u2019s important source fats which it requires for normal functioning of various parts of the eye including the retina and lens.\u00a0\nCarotenoids ( or carotenes) are yellowish to orangey-red pigment in plants and algae which give them color. Although luent is known scientifically as zexanthin, its common name is luiten. Luten acts as a light filter in the eyes. In the dark, a human retina contains a blue-purple color similar to that of ripe raspberries or inky blackberries. This dark color in a person\u2019s retinal is called cyanosein (pronounced as si-no-sen). This color is more vibrant to the naked eye when not exposed to light.\nStudies on Luteo and lumen as eye care supplements are going on as scientists and doctors are still trying to understand the mechanism by which these compounds fight macular degeneration. \u00a0Macular is the part of your eyes where the damage to sight first occurs. Because the macula is at the back and the center of a retina, the risk of its degenerating as the rest of our eyes does with age or with genetic factors increases significantly. When we lose part or the entire macule, we experience partial or complete blindness. Studies done so far on this topic have not yielded the results as to how these caro enes affect maculer or retinals in general. Further research will help us understand if these two compounds do protect the degenerative changes in human retinas with old age.\nOther reasons why your eye doctor may suggest that you increase your intake of these components is to prevent cataract formation in your lens as well as protect your retina from any sudden physical activity in day to day life which can cause damage such eye injuries, sports injuries or accidental trauma.", "These two are often associated with improved eye and brain health. As discussed in previous posts, lycopene has also been shown to exert the same benefits.\nAre they antioxidants?\nLute in and other carotenoids are antioxidants. Antioxidants are compounds that protect cells from the adverse effects of oxidants. When we eat food, our body breaks down some of the food into smaller molecules. One of these molecules is carotenes. The carote n molecules can be found in all living things, and are found naturally in many fruits and vegetables. Carotenoid pigments are responsible for the colors of our fruits. They also act as an antioxidant. A few of them are even found to cause certain diseases in humans, where the oxidized caro tenoids might be responsible\nWhat are the roles of carotonoids?\nCaroten oids provide nutrients for animals and the color of fruits as well as the redness of berries and cherries. But they also serve a vital role. Luteo ns, zeaxanthins, beta-carotenoids, alpha-caroten e and others help protect our eyes from retin a deficiency. It is believed that this is especially true for luten o and ze axanthin. Most of us know what the lutes do, but what about beta car oteno ids or alpha carone os? These are all caroenoid s that are vital to eyesight and eye he alth.\nLuten in is a key component of vitamin A.\nFor example, vitamin E is essential to protect eyes to fight off free radicals that can damage cells. Since eye cells do not produce vitamin e, we depend on this carotoenoid which is found abundantly in fruits. So if you want to get even better vision, you should also take ze xanthi n, the antioxidant that prevents the formation of reti na, a yellow substance associated w ith age related degeneration of vision.\nWhat do l u tei and o megas do for eye health?\nResearch shows that o met as can help decrease the risk of age-related macula r degenerati o n.

Children will have been vomiting if they are between three to 14 hours.\nStomach flu may result as quickly as six to seventy two hours after the virus has spread to the gastrointestinal tract", "What causes it? And, what can you do about it?\nThe flu is commonly and technically referred to as influenza; this is a highly contagious infection affecting the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs; it is caused by viruses and is extremely infectious, quickly spreading from animals to humans, but rarely among animals.\nA highly dangerous and often deadly disease, the influenza attacks quickly and at a higher rate than the common cold, which, compared to the two, has a longer incubation period.\nThe average time a person is usually sick with the type of flu we often hear about is two to five days. For those over the age of 65, that number can double to more than ten days.\nIn the United States, influenza infections are tracked and monitored by the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC uses a network of over 2,500 hospital, birthing, doctor, or other outpatient centers to closely watch and monitor the number of cases, as well as where the cases are, whether by state or city, age and gender, types of infection from different strains of viruses, etc.\nStomach Flu or Food Poisoning?\nTypically, flu symptoms are the results of an infection with an influenza virus; these viruses enter the body through contaminated water, food or air; they can spread from person to person, even without physical contact via things like a cough or sneeze; symptoms for flu virus (influenza) include things such as fever, runny or stuffy nose; body aches; sore throat; fatigue; diarrhea; sudden chills and shivering.\nWhat we term as stomach influenza are usually an intestinal virus, either from something like norovirus or rotavirus; or, more commonly, a stomach virus from the bacteria Clostridium difficile; the latter is more serious considering the potential for complications; people of all ages can get stomach or intestinal viruses; however, they are more common for infants and young children, those with underlying medical issues like diabetes, immune system disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), kidney disease; and, older adults.\nFor infants, young, children as we said, nursing mothers, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases or conditions, stomach viruses can usually mean stomach issues, like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever; most people will recover within a few days to a week. But, for the elderly, if the person has not", "What do you need to know with every case of influenza?\nIf the thought of a sick kid makes your stomach turn, you might be suffering from a common misunderstanding about the two flus.\nWe asked Jennifer Lighter, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, to clarify how the influenza virus is different from the more common childhood tummy bug, the gastroenteritis virus. Here\u2019s what you really need you to needto know about stomachaches, vomiting and diarrhea.", "Learn the symptoms, causes, risk factors and treatment of the different types of flu.\nIf you\u2019re feeling sick with a fever and vomiting, you may have the \u201cstomach flu,\u201d also known as gastroenteritis. Gastroenteriris is not the true flu, which is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Stomah flu is also not related to food poisoning due to toxic bacteria, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.\u00a0\nThere are common signs and symptoms of a stomach bug that include vomiting and diarrhea. It usually starts\u00a0within 18 hours of\u00a0being exposed to a virus or bacteria and it\u2019s usually gone within 48 hours, but in some cases, a person may take a week to fully recover.\nLearn more about the common symptoms and causes of stomach and flu:\nStomch flu symptoms\nStemach virus symptoms tend to be much more dramatic or sudden than the actual flu. The stomach virus is characterized by:\nFeeling nauseated and/or vomiting\nDiarrhea (loose stools) that may be bloody diarrhea\nFatigue is common due a loss of fluids and electrolytes.\nTrue flu (influenza) symptoms don\u2019t usually include abdominal pain or diarrhea, unless the patient also has gastroentritis. Some symptoms\u00a0of influenza include:\u00a0\nStachh flu causes\nIt may seem like one of your children comes home with vomitting and fever.\u00a0It is possible if you have other family members who haven\u2019t got sick, it is easy to think the child has the influenza, however, the bug is mostly spread through contaminated food and drinking water,\u00a0 according\u00a0to the Mayo Clinic. It is often spread from person to person as well.\nSymptoms of influenza can last up to 5-7 days but are not common with\u00a0stachm flu with or without antibiotics.\u00a0\nThe stomach type of virus does not typically last longer than a few days. In some\u00a0extreme situations, people can experience dehydration; this\u00a0can\u00a0happen even when a very small amount of stool and liquid are\u00a0lost.\nThe best thing to do if your child is vomiting is\u00a0keep them\u00a0quipped\u00a0with\u00a0plenty of liquids. Drinking water often is the best way to replenish lost fluids, followed by weak tea, milk, sugary fruit juices, clear broth\u00a0or electrolyte replacement fluids.", "The stomach bug, also called a stomach ailment, makes it difficult to go to the bathroom. It\u2019s a viral infection that generally clears up on its own in two or three days, but it can be nasty for the first few days.\nWhat illness can cause nausea and stomach pain?\nStomach pain with nausea, which occurs due to any of the above causes, is a common symptom of many health problems.\nHow do I know if a virus or the Stomachs are causing me to feel sick?\nViral infections or gastrointestinal viruses (GEV ) produce flu-like discomfort, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Viruses are small and cannot be destroyed by hand washing since they replicate inside the body. As well as being contagious, viruses can spread from person to person in the air, water, food, or waste.\nDo you have the symptoms of pneumonia?\nCoughing with yellow, green, rusty, foul-smelling, purulent mucus, shortness of breath, chest discomfort or tightness, fever (often 101 degrees), shaking chills, sweating at night, fatigue, loss of appetite, rapid pulse, weight loss, weakness, mental confusion, increased sputum production, phlegm, wheezing, body odor, nasal discharge, runny nose, congestion, sneez.\nWhat is the cause of a painful belly?\nPain in your lower abdominal pains (left and right) can have a variety of causes. Abdominal pain can signal a digestive illness, such as gastroenteritis (commonly known as \u201ctummy bug\u201d), a renal stone, appendicitis, an ovarian cyst, pelvic inflammatory illness, endometriosis, a UTI (urinary tract infection), gastroesophageal reflux disease, diverticular disease.\nCan you determine whether or not you\u2019re contagious through stomach influenza?\nThis virus spreads via direct contact with infected persons and through feces or contaminated water or surfaces. Adults and children who get viruses frequently get sick for 1 to 3 days on average, with symptoms such such diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, and a low fever. You are very contagious when you vomit or have diarrhea.\nWhen a person is ill, when do you seek medical attention?\nWhat does it mean when a dog is sick and has diarrhea?\nIf your pets have bloody diarrhea with vomiting, they have most likely gotten a large amount of toxic material into their stomachs at once (such as antif"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5439, "rouge1_r": 0.0896, "rouge1_f1": 0.1538, "rouge2_p": 0.125, "rouge2_r": 0.0203, "rouge2_f1": 0.0349, "rougel_p": 0.386, "rougel_r": 0.0636, "rougel_f1": 0.1092, "bleurt": 0.3213, "bert_score_p": 0.7982, "bert_score_r": 0.8763, "bert_score_f1": 0.8354, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.7368, "rouge1_r": 0.1, "rouge1_f1": 0.1761, "rouge2_p": 0.1786, "rouge2_r": 0.0239, "rouge2_f1": 0.0421, "rougel_p": 0.4386, "rougel_r": 0.0595, "rougel_f1": 0.1048, "bleurt": 0.3474, "bert_score_p": 0.7972, "bert_score_r": 0.8672, "bert_score_f1": 0.8307, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.6842, "rouge1_r": 0.1, "rouge1_f1": 0.1745, "rouge2_p": 0.125, "rouge2_r": 0.018, "rouge2_f1": 0.0315, "rougel_p": 0.4386, "rougel_r": 0.0641, "rougel_f1": 0.1119, "bleurt": 0.3231, "bert_score_p": 0.7871, "bert_score_r": 0.8711, "bert_score_f1": 0.827, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3333, "rouge1_r": 0.2346, "rouge1_f1": 0.2754, "rouge2_p": 0.0179, "rouge2_r": 0.0125, "rouge2_f1": 0.0147, "rougel_p": 0.2281, "rougel_r": 0.1605, "rougel_f1": 0.1884, "bleurt": 0.2343, "bert_score_p": 0.8245, "bert_score_r": 0.8589, "bert_score_f1": 0.8414, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6667, "rouge1_r": 0.1022, "rouge1_f1": 0.1772, "rouge2_p": 0.2857, "rouge2_r": 0.0431, "rouge2_f1": 0.0749, "rougel_p": 0.4386, "rougel_r": 0.0672, "rougel_f1": 0.1166, "bleurt": 0.3237, "bert_score_p": 0.7928, "bert_score_r": 0.8734, "bert_score_f1": 0.8312, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.6491, "rouge1_r": 0.0997, "rouge1_f1": 0.1729, "rouge2_p": 0.1071, "rouge2_r": 0.0162, "rouge2_f1": 0.0282, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.0512, "rougel_f1": 0.0888, "bleurt": 0.2799, "bert_score_p": 0.7936, "bert_score_r": 0.8704, "bert_score_f1": 0.8302, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

They also stop nausea through their action as anti-adrenergic agents.\nSome medications might be effective in treating nausea or vomit. While they may not work for everyone. There are some types that have fewer side effects or interactions so they can be used alone when necessary.\nYou can choose from the following options if you get nausea for more information about each drug class.\nProchlorperazine (Compazine): This drug may be administered intravenously, injected orally, or swallowed. One of its primary purposes is to reduce anxiety and stress. However, it can also help lower blood pressure.\nAntimetic: This medication works by blocking the release of stomach acids. It was initially developed to counter the side effect of migraine drugs.\nTrimetazine Hydrocholoride (Tigan): Similar to Tigan, this drug can't be taken intramuscularly. As a result, you can administer the drug by mouth or directly by injection into your spine.\nAcetylsal", "Is one better than the other?\nWe hear people often talk about nausea medications they\u2019ve heard about. But how does one differentiate which ones are available over-the-counter (OTC) and which require a prescription? Do they work differently? And why?\nTo help you further understand OTC versus prescription nausea and vomiting prevention drugs, let\u2019s look into these types of medications. They work in a variety of ways to ease nausea.\nDramamine is an anti-nausea, motion sickness drug and a type available OTR or Over-The-Counter. It acts as a \u201cdopamine blocker\u201d and can cause drowsiness.\nPronounced Benz-a-pehr-een. This is another OOT drug to use for motion sicknes and has few side effects, dizziness and sometimes constipation. Another one of the O-T-C type.\nMetoclopramide is also known as Aneron, is a drug that affects the upper digestive system, specifically the stomach, and is one which requires a pescription and not available in O-V-C form. There might be side-effects such as sleepiness, restlessness, headache, irritability, or dizzness.\nProchlorperazine is primarily used for treating nausea, although it may be used to treat certain other serious conditions when other medications have not been effective.\nOndansetron is in an O-Trp-I-C drug for nausea. As with most of these nausea drugs there can be sleepyness, fever, cough, hives, rash, itching or swelling.\nThese are all drugs that are availiable in Over-the-Counters (O-T-Cs) form although some require prescriptions.\nHow often can I take antinauseas?", "My stomach feels sensitive and I don't want to take anything that will upset it. Thanks!\nThere are many different types of medication for nausea. Some examples are: prochlorperazine, promethazine hydrochloride, metoclopramide hydrocholride. Your doctor can prescribe you the most appropriate medication to treat your symptoms based on your medical record. Hope this helps.", "Yes, there are. Because nausea is just a feeling in the stomach, nausea medications are used to prevent it from happening by blocking receptors for a chemical in our bodies called serotonin.\nWhat are the typical side effects of these nausea treatment drugs in Las Vegas? The most common side effect of this class of drugs is diarrhea. Some patients may also have upset stomach with cramps and bloating. Although these symptoms may worsen nausea associated with migraines and other conditions, it may happen with this kind of medication in order to work for patients. Patients may see a mild weight loss due to the diarrhea caused but they shouldn\u2019t be concerned. They should also consider seeking professional help when diarrhea lasts for more that three days.\nCan nausea and vomiting medications cause other problems? There could be a delay in menstruation when nausea drugs are taken for too long. Some drugs could also block certain enzymes in your body that could cause liver problems and low potassium levels. These medications may affect the blood flow in some parts of your brain which could interfere with your thinking and memory. If you experience any of the issues mentioned, immediately inform your doctor about it. Make sure that you continue taking the drug until you are guided when and how to stop taking it.\nDo nausea meds cause birth defects? Like most other kinds of meds or OTC drugs, some of them may harm an unborn baby. That is why it important to share any kind if pregnancy or conception plans with the doctor prescribing your drug. It is important that your pregnancy is not in its first trimester yet. Most medications can harm the baby by causing birth defect.\nHow can you get rid of vomiting and nausea? The problem may have an underlying cause which can be cured by treating it alone. For example, if your nausea problem is due cancer radiation therapy, then you should talk to your oncologist to learn how you can control it before you will be on the treatment.\nTalk to a pharmacist: This is the best alternative for most patients because pharmacists have access to lots of resources. You could either call your pharmacy or personally visit one. Visit only those that are accredited online for reliability.\nUse a natural approach: There are quite some herbal products that have proven to be effective for people with nausea problems. However, you need to take time to do your research before using one.\nMake your own remedy: You will see that some drugs will only act as a placebo since it is natural. Try adding ginger to any juice or just drinking a ginger tea. There", "I need a pill that isn\u2019t drowsy.\nMany over-the-counter (OTC) anti-nausea medications that are available for pregnancy related nausea are not chemically addictive or habit-forming and are dextrorotatory.\nThe most common anti-excitement medication are: diphenhydramine benzoate, doxylamine, dimenhydrinate, and meclizine.\nThese drugs act by blocking dopamine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems.\nThey do not work on the nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness.\nIt is believed that their effectiveness comes from the drugs\u2019 ability to block the effects of histamine.\nDo you also suffer from motion-sickness or dizziness when flying?\nMotion-sick individuals respond very different to anti-nausea medication depending on their particular condition.\nMotion sickness and dizzines are sometimes difficult conditions to treat. If you suffer these conditions with flying, I recommend trying an anti-drowsyness medication called scopolamine (transdermal system) before the flight.\nIf it doesn\u2019t help, you can try taking another type. It is important to know that, if you find a remedy that works for you, the same formula should be used every time you fly.\nFor other types of motion and sea sickness, ask your pharmacist about a prescription or non-prescription medicine.\nSome anti-sea and motion dugs are more effective than others, depending upon the particular motion condition which you are experiencing.\nOne way to prevent or lessen motion or sea- sickness is to avoid your body\u2019s motion sense for as long as possible.\nThis means that if at all possible, keep your eyes closed or look straight ahead. Do not bend down to read, eat or watch a movie.\nAvoid large waves while boating or driving in rain or snow, as they may jar you or your vehicle.\nKeep the air in your car or bus cooler than your nose so that the cold air will cool off your nasal passages.\nTry not to look out of the car to the side or you may feel motion sick.\nYour pharmacist offers an extensive review of anti-motion, anti-sleep and anti-boring pills.\nRemember to ask all your questions and make sure to consult your doctor before trying any new medications."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5392, "rouge1_r": 0.1378, "rouge1_f1": 0.2196, "rouge2_p": 0.1683, "rouge2_r": 0.0427, "rouge2_f1": 0.0681, "rougel_p": 0.3137, "rougel_r": 0.0802, "rougel_f1": 0.1277, "bleurt": 0.3918, "bert_score_p": 0.8199, "bert_score_r": 0.8359, "bert_score_f1": 0.8278, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5098, "rouge1_r": 0.16, "rouge1_f1": 0.2436, "rouge2_p": 0.1089, "rouge2_r": 0.034, "rouge2_f1": 0.0518, "rougel_p": 0.2451, "rougel_r": 0.0769, "rougel_f1": 0.1171, "bleurt": 0.3034, "bert_score_p": 0.8133, "bert_score_r": 0.844, "bert_score_f1": 0.8284, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4804, "rouge1_r": 0.1907, "rouge1_f1": 0.273, "rouge2_p": 0.099, "rouge2_r": 0.0391, "rouge2_f1": 0.056, "rougel_p": 0.2255, "rougel_r": 0.0895, "rougel_f1": 0.1281, "bleurt": 0.3047, "bert_score_p": 0.8088, "bert_score_r": 0.8374, "bert_score_f1": 0.8228, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.1765, "rouge1_r": 0.3273, "rouge1_f1": 0.2293, "rouge2_p": 0.0594, "rouge2_r": 0.1111, "rouge2_f1": 0.0774, "rougel_p": 0.098, "rougel_r": 0.1818, "rougel_f1": 0.1274, "bleurt": 0.2487, "bert_score_p": 0.8406, "bert_score_r": 0.8209, "bert_score_f1": 0.8306, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5686, "rouge1_r": 0.1283, "rouge1_f1": 0.2094, "rouge2_p": 0.1188, "rouge2_r": 0.0266, "rouge2_f1": 0.0435, "rougel_p": 0.3235, "rougel_r": 0.073, "rougel_f1": 0.1191, "bleurt": 0.308, "bert_score_p": 0.8104, "bert_score_r": 0.815, "bert_score_f1": 0.8127, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4608, "rouge1_r": 0.1295, "rouge1_f1": 0.2022, "rouge2_p": 0.0891, "rouge2_r": 0.0249, "rouge2_f1": 0.0389, "rougel_p": 0.2255, "rougel_r": 0.0634, "rougel_f1": 0.0989, "bleurt": 0.2914, "bert_score_p": 0.8095, "bert_score_r": 0.8334, "bert_score_f1": 0.8213, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}]}

I've been to the bathroom 5 times in the last 24 hours. Is this normal?", "(This question is answered by our Dietitian)\nYes. Some people who have fatty livers are prescribed a medication called Ursodiol or Ursodeoxycholic acid. It is called ursodaiol or UCA and it helps prevent the formation of gallstones in people with liver disease and is also prescribed to improve liver function in those with a diseased liver or for fatty deposits in the liver.\nUCA can also help resolve itchy skin caused by high cholesterol and fat in liver cells. This medicine comes as a liquid you take by mouth.\nIf you have been diagnosed with \"non-alcoholic fatty degeneration of the Liver\" and given the medicine for it then you may take it with Immodium. If you are not on the medication, you should be advised by your doctor as the two medicines should not be taken together.\nCan I use Imodiam over a period of six months without any side effect? Is there any chance of drug interaction? I do take some medication for HBP\nTaking Imogen daily for over six weeks may make your heart rate slow down slightly and may affect the way your body uses sugar. Long-term use also may increase the risk of allergic reactions. Your doctor should monitor you carefully for side effects such as diarrhea.", "I want to take it for occasional diarrhea.\nMy doctor prescribed it, but I'm afraid to use it because everyone online is warning me that it could be harmful to a liver patient. Please advise.\nThe drug of concern is in my view loperamide. See the link below for info on lopramide and its use.\nYou can take imodium. There are other laxatives that probably should be avoided because of how they work though.", "(For the purpose of travel?)\nI have IBS-D. My doctor recently diagnosed my with a Fatty Liver. I'm wondering if Immodium is one of those things I now need to be on the lookout for?\nI've heard in regards to diet that a lot of people find success with the Candida diet for helping a bad liver. The problem is that it's a diet which takes a long time to see if it works. What are my options for a faster solution for it?\nDr. Robert Mcdowell answered\nYes: Yes, people can safely use immeodium or lorezamide (immodiium) for relief of diarrhea. Diarrhea might be due to a wide variety of reasons in your case including the fatty infiltration in the liver which causes a backup of bile to the intestinal tract, so one should discuss with your doctor what possible causes are. People with liver disease usually need much less immodiuim so it important to consult your liver doctor.\nDepends on fatty: The primary concern with imodium is impaired absorption of drugs. But if your diarrhea is under control you probably will not need it for long. See a gastroenterologist. They will sort you out.\nCan I use metamucil and senna at the same time? I recently had a liver biopsy and was told that I had fatty Liver, my dr is looking into the cause so in my down time I've been doing research. So, I understand why I should stay away from milk thistle but will sennoside, etc affect this condition?\nLiver & fatty-liver: Liver is the most essential organ for life. It makes various enzymes for digestion which you use the food. Due to fatty deposits (fat in blood may increase) or alcohol intake the function is reduced. Liver damage & FLL is reversible. Treatments depend upon the underlying cause. Medications that you are taking needs to review. You will be fine.

It can be an early sign of liver damage or disease. Focal Fattytissue is caused by a build-up of fat particles on the surface of certain liver cells.\nHow did you acquire a FATTY LIVER?\nAlcoholic Fata Liver Disease (ALFD) \u2014 ALFD is the most common form of fatty livers. People over time develop ALD as they drink too many alcoholic beverages.\nNonalcoholic Steatohepatitis \u2014 This is less severe than ALDD, but still not a good sign. Nonalcoholics who consume a lot of saturated fatty foods and carbs might acquire this malady. NASH is usually a precursor to cirrhosis or liver cancer and needs treatment.\nOther possible causes include heredity, pregnancy, malnutrition, diabetes, and medications like methotrexate. Most of the time, a person develops fatty tissues over a few weeks, months, or years.\nOne of your organs \u2014 the liver \u2014 processes everything you eat and drink and converts it into energy. When you ingest too sugary, fatty or alcoholic foods, your insulin spikes, which causes fat to build up in your cells. Liver cells can get too fatty and clogged with fat. After that, the fat can cause inflammation, scarring, liver disease, cirrosis, cancer, etc. Eventually, you will lose a portion of that portion.\nI strongly advise you not to use Immodium because it has negative effects on your body while you could treat the underlying problem naturally. Here are a couple of ideas, one of them is just an idea, not research.\n  1. Take 3 capsules 2-3 times per day, containing 375mg Curcumin (Turmeric), in addition to your current supplements if you are taking any, as it helps relieve liver issues.\nTurmeriC is an organic material with anti-inflammatory effects, including curcumerods. However, curcumoids are the only turmeroids that function in human cells and are responsible for turmeric's health-giving effects.\nCurcumanoids help remove free radicals from your bloodstream and provide protection from liver fibrosis.\nFor this, we have the following product that is very good:\nTurmeRice Capsules 600mg by Dr. Berg Nutrition (One Bottle)\nNote"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1316, "rouge1_r": 0.2439, "rouge1_f1": 0.1709, "rouge2_p": 0.0133, "rouge2_r": 0.025, "rouge2_f1": 0.0174, "rougel_p": 0.0658, "rougel_r": 0.122, "rougel_f1": 0.0855, "bleurt": 0.2171, "bert_score_p": 0.8404, "bert_score_r": 0.8287, "bert_score_f1": 0.8345, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5658, "rouge1_r": 0.2019, "rouge1_f1": 0.2976, "rouge2_p": 0.12, "rouge2_r": 0.0425, "rouge2_f1": 0.0627, "rougel_p": 0.2632, "rougel_r": 0.0939, "rougel_f1": 0.1384, "bleurt": 0.3586, "bert_score_p": 0.8262, "bert_score_r": 0.8656, "bert_score_f1": 0.8455, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.2895, "rouge1_r": 0.2933, "rouge1_f1": 0.2914, "rouge2_p": 0.0267, "rouge2_r": 0.027, "rouge2_f1": 0.0268, "rougel_p": 0.1316, "rougel_r": 0.1333, "rougel_f1": 0.1325, "bleurt": 0.3214, "bert_score_p": 0.8643, "bert_score_r": 0.8623, "bert_score_f1": 0.8633, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5789, "rouge1_r": 0.1122, "rouge1_f1": 0.188, "rouge2_p": 0.12, "rouge2_r": 0.023, "rouge2_f1": 0.0386, "rougel_p": 0.3158, "rougel_r": 0.0612, "rougel_f1": 0.1026, "bleurt": 0.2879, "bert_score_p": 0.794, "bert_score_r": 0.8534, "bert_score_f1": 0.8226, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2763, "rouge1_r": 0.1511, "rouge1_f1": 0.1953, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1184, "rougel_r": 0.0647, "rougel_f1": 0.0837, "bleurt": 0.2778, "bert_score_p": 0.808, "bert_score_r": 0.8276, "bert_score_f1": 0.8177, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5526, "rouge1_r": 0.1163, "rouge1_f1": 0.1922, "rouge2_p": 0.0667, "rouge2_r": 0.0139, "rouge2_f1": 0.023, "rougel_p": 0.2763, "rougel_r": 0.0582, "rougel_f1": 0.0961, "bleurt": 0.3133, "bert_score_p": 0.7892, "bert_score_r": 0.8334, "bert_score_f1": 0.8107, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}]}

However, as we shall see below, the substance is being used by athletes to improve their times.\nColchine acts by inhibiting the polymerization of tubulin, a protein that is a major constituent of microtubules within cells. By inhibiating tubulins ability to polymerize it prevents the assembly of the mitotic spindle necessary for cells to differentiate. (It also prevents cell division.) This means that colcheine blocks the cell cycle at either the G1 (pre mitosis) or the M (mitosis phase) phase of differentiation. It should be noted that at the correct dose, cells may differentiate even when these phases are blocked. Thus, it can be effective in the treatment of cancer. Other drugs that have similar action are vincristine and vinblastine.\nInhibition of other micro tubule functions may also play a role in gouts because gours may be caused by the buildup of uric acid in joints. The urate crystals inhibit the depolarization response of muscle cells and by doing this, induce the release of potassium and hydrogen ions (which is the painful part and also the cause of some inflammation). It is believed that the action of colicine to inhibit tubules leads to a reduction of inflammatory response.\nHowever, to return to the original question of if we should worry. Well, colchie has been used for more than just gous. As early as 1938 it was used in a study involving heart muscle. And it is also used as an anti\u2013inflammatory drug both as topical solution and internal ingestion. For this reason it has also been studied as alternative treatment for asthma.\nOne study in particular published in 1990 indicated that \u201cColchyne (Biospray), an alkaloid with anti-inflammatory properties, has some clinical use as inhalation drops for patients suffering from inflammatory conditions of respiratory mucosa and airways, including bronchial asthma\u201d and another showed that Colchicin \u201cmay be useful for anti-asthmatic therapies because bronchodilatation and increased ciliary beating were also found\u201d.

Generic Colis is the generic generic colgy 5 brand name of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant. Amitriptiline and amiodarone are both anticonvulsants. Amiodone acts to block the release of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and histamine. Both of these neurotransmitter inhibitors interfere with the ability of your brain to send neurotransmission signals. Anticolcine is an antitoxine that has been developed for use in cancer treatment. It works by decreasing the activity of a neurotransmitting protein, called GABA. GAB A has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.\nAmiodopine (Amiphen) was discovered in 1986. Since then it has undergone numerous trials, including a combination therapy trial in Japan. While it is not yet approved in Europe, it was approved by FDA in March of 2009, in order to address the growing global pandemic. Why does this make it difficult to find a generic form of this medicine? It is manufactured by many manufacturers, most of them selling it at a higher price. Although there are still several manufacturers selling this drug at reasonable prices, these companies are unable to supply it in any significant amount.

By\nBenedry, an antihistamine, is widely used as an over the counter medication for allergies and other similar\nconditions. Nyquil is a sleeping aid syrup, the effect of which is to help you to sleep. A\ncouple of questions I have are. Are the two medicines safe to take at\nthe same exact time. If not, then I am concerned that taking nyquill prior\nand then benodryll after will have the opposite effect, ie: will keep me from\nmy planned sleep.\nAre the drugs safe if taken close together, either several hours prior or\neven several minutes apart? Can I still drive or will I make my\nneighborhood a wreck of drowsy, stupid pedestrians and possibly drivers?\nThe answer to the last question is that benadry1 does not impair the ability to drive while NyQuil does. But I don\u2019t know either of those drugs that well, so I\u2019m going to be a bit cautious about answering your question.\nWhen you look up the ingredients of Nyquist. it will tell you that it does have an ingredient called doxylamine. Doxilamine is an old anticholinergic which has been used for decades as a \u201csleeping aid\u201d. However, it\u2019s one of the classic antimuscarinic drugs, and most of them impair short term memory (and cause difficulty in cognitive processing) and make driving or operating machinery very difficult if not impossible.\nFor that reason, some states have taken these drugs off the list of legally prescribed antitussives or cough suppressants. The most important reason for this is because several of these products have a tendency to cause confusion, stupor, coma, respiratory arrest and even death.\nSo my answer is NO.

While there\u2019s no definitive answer on the subject of how much is too much or which foods are out of bounds, you? ll get good results by limiting the amount of sugar that you ingest or by avoiding all of it. Here are a few tips that can help you learn more about diabetic sweets, desserts and diabetic food.\nIf you are diabetic, it?s important to remember that eating a healthy diet full of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and fats will be very important in maintaining good health. You may even benefit from a high protein diet, especially if you have problems with weight.\nThe food pyramid should be a helpful tool for dieter with diabetes, as it lays out the major food groups in the best order. However, diabets should also know that the sugar content in fruits and vegetables varies widely. Fruits that are high in natural sugars should always be eaten as-is, without adding sweeteners.\nDesserts, on-the-other-hand, are usually loaded with sugar (sugar is one of several kinds of nutrients contained in many common foods). Sugar isn?t the same thing as fructose. Fructose is the type found in fruit that?s good for you and is low in calories. Sugar is used in baked desserts because it provides an extra kick. Most people who eat a lot of sweets tend to do so because they crave sweet foods.\nFor most people, however, dessert means cake. A piece of cake can include up to 16 teaspoons of granulated sugar, which is about one quarter of your daily recommended calorie allotment. That?s more than a quarter teaspoon of glucose. Because most dietician are aware of this excess in sugar consumption, they have learned to limit their intake of certain high-sugar desserts. If you must opt for sugar-laden desserts, limit them to one serving per day.\nSome diabeths have found that one type or another of dessert can be acceptable for their condition. Some may find a sweet that replaces some of carbohydrates with protein and fiber (like rice crackers), while others may prefer a dessert that has a very low glycogen content (such as chocolate.) Most cake recipes list their calorie content, so you will know if your dessert selection is meeting your needs.\nWhile some dietians choose to reduce the frequency of consumption", "Diabetes has changed my life.

I also have a sore throat and a cough. My neck is very sore and I feel like I am getting a cold. The veins in my neck are distended. Is this a sign of a serious infection?\nSinus infections can cause a variety of symptoms, including neck and throat pain, cough, and fever. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses, which are hollow spaces in the bones around the nose. When the sinus cavities become inflamed, they can become blocked, causing mucus to build up and leading to infection. This can result in symptoms such as facial pain or pressure, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, headache, fatigue, bad breath, toothache, or cough.\nSinuses are located in your forehead, behind your eyes, in between your eyebrows, on either side of your nose, above your upper teeth, below your cheekbones, inside your ears, around your throat, under your chin, at the base of skull, etc. They drain into the nasal cavity through small openings called ostia. If these openings become obstructed due to inflammation, mucas builds up inside the cavites causing pain.\nThe most common cause of sinusitis in adults is a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Other causes include allergies, deviated septum, polyps, foreign bodies, trauma, tumors, cysts, abscesses, dental problems, chronic sinus disease, immunodeficiency disorders, pregnancy, smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to irritants such aas dust, chemicals, fumes, pollution, stress, lack of sleep, poor nutrition, obesity, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease.\nIn children, the most frequent cause is adenoiditis. Adenoids are lymphoid tissue located at back of throat. These tissues become enlarged due infection or inflammation. Enlarged adenoids block the opening of eustachian tube which connects middle ear with nose and mouth. As a result, fluid accumulates in middle ears causing earache. Sometimes, adenoidal enlargement may lead to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\nNeck pain is often associated with sinus problems. It can occur when the muscles around sinusal caveties become tight and spasm. Neck pain may also result from pressure exerted by swollen lymph nodes in neck region. Swollen lymph node can compress nerves passing through them causing numbness, tingling sensation, weakness, paralysis,", "And if so, is neck CT scan the right test to order to diagnose?\nThe diagnosis of neck and facial pain is a bit more difficult. The only imaging that can define sinus abnormality is computed tomography (CT). This may show whether the sinuses are draining, and whether there are sinus walls that are thickened. However, neck veins are distended when the neck is swollen from sinus infection and not due to any of the causes of distension of central venous pressure. See the related article entitled \"Can a sinus Infection Cause Neck Vein Distention?\" in this blog. Other imaging, such as a contrast MRI of sinus, would not be of benefit, nor would MR venography be beneficial.\nIn summary, CT of sinuss (but not facial and jaw tissues) would be appropriate in the presence of facial swelling.", "Is this a possible neck infection? What are the symptoms of the cervical lymphadenopathy of sinus infection and how long will it take to clear up?\nThese are very interesting questions. I assume the neck swelling and discomfort you experience as the sinus issues clear, is related to pharyngitis as well as neck muscle strain.\nSometimes in the middle the ear or nasal cavity we can get an infection that is really a post-nasal drip. It causes the body to try to drain and expel it. Sometimes people cannot get drainage and the infection can migrate downward from the upper respiratory tract, causing swollen neck muscles and lymph nodes that can become infected. The best treatment, as always, for this type of infection is with antibiotics.\nHowever, it is also useful to consider the cause of your condition. Since we are usually seeing that these infections can be caused by sinusitis, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory issues, treating the root cause is important as is clearing the sinuses. My suggestion is to take this into consideration because once the lymph node and muscle strains clear you can avoid a recurrence of this condition.\nI can send you some links which will teach you how you to prevent and treat chronic phlegm and postnasal drip issues. So, if in addition to using antibiotics, you treat the actual cause which may be allergies, viruses and infection, and/or sinus obstruction and chronic inflammation. You can feel a lot better and prevent recurrence.", "- All Questions - SinusWars6 : Cure & Relieve Sinuses, Congestion and Headaches!\nSinus infections are the cause of neck pains, and in rare cases of swelling along with pain. Sinovenosities cause the same as well. These are caused by infections as we know them today. Usually these infections or illnesses are treated using antibiotics by your doctor. They are also treated this way because of the nature of a bacteria. It is hard to diagnose if these symptoms are indeed sinus pain, because there is a large possibility that this pain is actually caused from a viral infection such as the common cold. Viruses do not respond to antibiotics the way that a bacterial infection does. There are ways to detect whether you have this infection or not, a simple test can be done by going to your GP and letting an ENT specialist or ENT surgeon do what is called an endoscopy or sinus procedure to look down your nose and observe if you do have an infection. The swelling and the sinus can also be seen in the procedure and will determine how long it has been there.\nSinuses may also cause pain in your lower extremities.\nThis is usually from sinus venosites or veins that are too close together.\nWhen the body is straining to get rid of an excreted or a toxin the circulation of your blood does not flow freely and you will get pain associated with it.

What about nausea, dizziness, and a weak, fuzzy or tingling head? We\u2019ll tell you all of the facts and answer any questions you may have.\nWhat are sinus headaches? They are an intense headache around the sinus areas of your head. The pain can be felt in the areas around your eyes, nose, brow, cheeks, temples, forehead, or even at the back of head and upper neck area. Pain could be dull, aching, throbbing, sharp, shooting, piercing, stabbing, dull and constant, etc. Some people experience a sinus headache as a throbing pain with a sensation of pressure along with nasal congestion. Others will have postnasal drip and sore throat, sometimes accompanied by nausea. Pressure could also be in both the cheek areas. Other symptoms of sinusitis include thick mucus, nasal and chest congestion, itchy and watery eyes.\nThese headaches can become very severe, even disabling at times. They can cause nausea and vomiting in some people.\nPeople with allergy problems usually suffer frequent sinus infection episodes. But, sinus pain is also caused by other conditions that do not improve from antibiotics. These can involve the bones of upper face or the membranes inside your nose. This is why it is so important to be certain that it IS a true sinus problem. Sinus infection is an inflammation of membranes lining the inside of nose and sinuses (air cavities in your skull connected to inside the nose). If not treated, the infection can spread to other bone in face and even to the base of skull. Sometimes the pressure around eyes and in cheeks is mistaken for a toothache, but a real tooth infection does not cause a runny nose.\nWhy do sinus attacks cause head pressure and pain? An infected sinus causes congestion with lots of extra mucas in nose as your bodys defense. (This is not your original sinos tissue.) Then this mucos cannot drain away correctly. It stays inside nose with swelling and inflammation that blocks any drainage flow. You wind up with congestion and headaches, along wth possible fever.

Can you help me?\nI am sorry to hear that you are having difficulty sleeping. Insomnia is a common problem that can be caused by a variety of factors. It is important to determine the underlying cause of your insomnia in order to develop an effective treatment plan. In some cases, insomnia may be due to a medical condition, such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome. If this is the case, your doctor may recommend treatment for these conditions. Other causes of insomnia include stress, anxiety, and depression. These conditions can often be treated with medication or therapy. However, if you have tried these treatments and are still having problems sleeping, you may need a different approach. One option is to try a natural sleep aid. There are many different types of natural supplements that claim to help with insomnia. Some of these supplements contain melatonin, which is thought to regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. Others contain herbs like valerian root or chamomile, both of which have traditionally been used to promote relaxation and sleep. Before taking any supplement, it is always important\nI have a question about Ambian. Is it safe to take Ambain for a long period of time? My friend has been on it for over a year and she says it's the only thing that helps her sleep.\nAmbien is not safe for long-term use. The FDA has issued a warning about the risks of taking Amben for more than two weeks. Ambin can cause serious side effects, including addiction and death. Talk to your healthcare provider if Ambine is right for you.\nI'm having a hard time sleeping and I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to make it easier. Do you know of any natural remedies that might help?\nThere are a few things you can try to improve your sleep quality. First, make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet. You may also want to avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Additionally, try taking a warm bath or shower before bedtime. Finally, consider using a sleep mask or earplugs to block out light and noise.", "I have chronic insomnia, and the only reason I started this was for the sleep portion.\nHi, I do not believe that this program can help insomnia.

It's also a very cheap chemical that many companies used to make counterfeit pills. You couldn't tell if it might just be a placebo, so I had to try it for my self a dozen times to know if I felt any changes.\nIn the last years, a doctor gave me some small pills which contain 6mg of melatonine, each. The problem with these is that they usually last a few weeks, since there are only 60 in a box, even though every single pill in the box looks and feels the same.\nThe solution was for me and my doctor to cut these little balls in half. As the pill contains 14mg at that size and weight it made it last four weeks instead of only two. There are still no visible marks on them to note the size.\nWith this, the doctor had solved my problem, or so you think. Last month after a sudden death in my family I could not get back to sleep one night in two or three weeks. After three days and three nights I still couldn\u2019t get proper sleep.\nTo make my life work again, after asking my friend Tifus, he and his girlfriend brought me a sample of his custom made sleep spray.

My GP has suggested seeing a psychiatrist but as I don\u2019t find myself depressed or anxious I would rather try alternatives.\nSleep is a very important aspect of living a healthful life. It is not uncommon for someone to find that their ability to get restful sleep declines as they age. This is the result of shifting hormone levels and biological rhythms; however there are other environmental factors that can come into play such as noise and light exposure, as well as unhealthy habits such a too much sugar, too many stimulants, and too little exercise.\nFor adults seeking to improve their sleep quality, I have found these suggestions below to be most effective.", "I am not sure if the long term sleep hygiene course is right for me at this point. I want to find something better to help me for this issue in as short period of time as possible (2 or 3 months.).\nYes there are several approaches we can use. For the short and longer term issues, the first thing I usually recommend is establishing a sleep \"hygiene\" routine and practicing a bit of \"stress moderation\". You can begin by reading through our material about these topics. Try to follow all the guidelines for a period (maybe a month) to see if that improves your sleep a little. If you find that you are too stressed during the day and you have too much to do or think about, you may find the sleep medication might not help. You might be better off taking a medication for your stress. Sometimes it can be good to talk things out with someone and get some clarity about some things, a counselor or therapist who can help you put them in perspective. A psychiatrist can prescribe a medicine that will help reduce stress that might also help with the insomnia if this is not working.\nYou could ask the pharmacist at the store where you get the medicines about any good stress reducers that could be combined with a sleeping pill. He or she might have advice about other options as well. These suggestions would help until you can start with hypnosis treatment a couple weeks before your wedding.\nIf it doesn't get better after a while, we have many options available if you would want us to work together on it.", "Is there a sleeping medication that has been created to provide short-term use?\nInsomnia is often associated with depression, anxiety and the effects of chronic pain, but it can also occur on its own through a combination of several factors. You may suffer from a poor sleep hygiene which refers to practices such as having poor bed time routines and consuming caffeine and alcohol. Sleep deprivation may cause your body to have difficulty regulating its appetite, hormonal levels, mood and focus.\nA short duration treatment with a drug designed specifically for sleep is not recommended. Even though such a medication may help you sleep, it usually will not address the associated problems that cause insomnia. If you are currently in an environment that promotes a good sleep routine, then there is no reason why you cannot continue to use a sleep medicine such Benadryl, Halcion, or Lunesta. Such a medicine will only be effective if the other variables are kept under control.\nInsomniacs are known for having difficulty falling asleep. It may be helpful to determine how long it takes to fall asleep each night and this may reveal some specific needs. Try eliminating all electronics about a half hour before bed. Turn the temperature in your room down to 65 degrees Fahrenheit and ensure there are no distractions in the room such noise or light. Aromatherapy such the lavender essential oil can be placed on your pillow.

I am also taking a multi-vitamin and fish oil.", "Thanks.\nDear N,\nThere is nothing that will provide immediate relief.\u00a0 However, I can tell you a number of things that can help you over time. \u00a0I wrote a few books on anxiety. I hope these books will be helpful to you.\nThe first book is called The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook and it has practical, step by step techniques for overcoming generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, panic attacks, as well as obsessive compulsive disorder. The exercises are easy to follow. It\u2019s like doing your homework. If you do them over a month or two it will transform your mood and help calm you down.\nThere are three things I recommend you address:\n  1. Stop worrying. Worrying is like sitting in a rowboat and trying to catch a fish by scooping up water. Just like the fish is not going to get caught in the scoop, anxiety will NOT be tamed by thinking about it. To reduce anxiety you need to replace it with something else, such as a hobby, or a game you play with your children. When you find yourself worrying, stop what you are doing and engage in an activity that makes you happy, which takes your attention away from the worry.\nTo prevent worrying throughout your day use a distraction technique. This is what I call a \u201cworry jar.\u201d It is a glass jar that you can fill with water and float little trinkets inside. Every time your mind drifts to worrying about something you see a trinkle inside the jar and you distract yourself just to take your focus away; something small like looking at a sunset, admiring the flowers, calling a friend, watching a movie, listening to music, laughing\u2026 anything that takes the focus off of what troubles you so you don\u2019t feel the anxiety of it.\n 2. Exercise. Many people with generalized feelings of anxiety find that as their bodies become more physically healthy, the mind follows. You will feel better and not be as tense or uptight. For example, a good morning walk or jog in fresh air and sunshine can really improve your outlook. Any sport, working out in your own backyard or the local gym, will give you those endorphins. They are often called the \u201chappy\u201d hormones that help lower anxiety.\nAerobic exercise releases endogenous opioids, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These chemicals create a feeling of wellbeing and a heightened sense of vigor called runner\u2019s high. Increased endurance", "Some of the things you suggested I think are good, just looking for something else as the supplements can\u2019t seem to work well with me, thanks.\nSo you\u2019ve tried ashwagandha, rhodiola and magnesium? What form and how did you dose it? Magnesium might have to be a high dose, say 800mg on an empty stomach, rather than a little sprinkle in your tea for better results.\nAre you taking these with other medications? It can be tricky to know where one medication affects another. For example ashwangandah may help anxiety through it's effects on the dopaminergic or serotonergic system for example, which may be the problem. But these herbs work with dopamine and serotonin, other herbs may work better with cortisol and epinephrine such as rosemary and sage. Have you looked into those?\nI was going to say to look at some more common supplements like B12 and fish oil also help, as do some of these other natural remedies. Is there a reason that they won't work for you? Did your doctor tell you to avoid these type of supplements or herbs?\nTry some lavender or chamomile? You can take both in a tea or apply lavender oil to the skin or in shampoo as a perfume.", "I like that you point out how it helps to have friends who can provide support. I do have a friend that I see weekly. Maybe I should invite her over so she could see the place I live. Thank you for sharing!", "I am 17 years old. The most important thing about having anxiety or depression is to find a good medical professional to help you. It is important to know that while these symptoms are normal, if they begin to cause you to not be able to perform life's daily tasks, or you find that they are causing problems in your life, then it is time to seek professional help in order that a diagnosis can be made, and a plan initiated for the treatment. My symptoms range from insomnia sleeplessness, extreme nausea, heart palpitations, sweating profusely, racing heart, hyperventilation, fear, loss of memory, flashbacks, crying, vomiting, uncontrollable shaking of my hands, shortness of breath and panic, dizziness, lightheadedness, and just extreme fear all the time. At least your son has been diagnosed, in which he is getting the proper treatment he needs. I have no idea of why this has come about now but I would like to get past it.

We need you in our life to make it happy. You have been there, done that, but not every person with whom you come into contact has so been. Your doctor will also ask you about your medical history, including any medications that you are taking. Most times I know intellectually that it's coming up but once it does I feel like there's no option but to fight it and try to control the breathing. In addition, some of the drugs that increase serotonin levels in the brain also increase norepinephrine levels. That is why it it imperative that each individual who is diagnosed with an anxiety disorder must work collaboratively with the mental health practitioner to assure the success of treatment efforts, because it varies greatly from one person to the next.\nIt can help determine what is causing your anxiety, as well as rule out more serious disorders.

For this reason, the doctor prescribes me antibiotic. The usual cause of infection sinus, sinus in the bones within the nose is caused by viral, bacterial or fungal infections. One may experience sinus infections that last for about 3 weeks or more. Infections can be treated by antibiotic sinus medications or by using surgery.\nIn some cases, these sinus cavities can get inflamed and cause the infection called the bacterial sinus. This virus is associated with the inflammation that will occur inside the sinuses and will cause sinus blockages and stress. You can also make them feel better by doing sinus rinse, using decongestants, or using nasal steroids.

They have the same success as placebos, which doesn't mean you shouldn't use them. There are a lot of people who feel better, so you don\"t want to withhold them from someone who wants them,\" said Dr. Andrew Blitzer, professor of otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) at New York University Langone Medical Center in NewYork City.\nSinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses that can cause symptoms including nasal blockage, facial pain, sinus discharge, sore throat and bad breath.\nThe researchers, who were writing in a study published online May31 in the journal JAMA Otolaryngaology Head & Neck Surgery, found that patients with sinus disease are 10 times more willing to seek surgery when they use a placebo rather than an active antibiotic. The surgery that they receive, however, is no more successful.\n\"We found 100 percent success of surgeries to endonasal sinus surgeries,\" Bltizer said. \"That's hard to accomplish in anything.\"\nThe findings come from a randomized controlled trial, conducted through four medical practices in Israel, of 60 patients who had primary treatment and care for chronic rhinosinusitis, often for at least a year. Their chronic symptoms include persistent sinus congestion and facial pressure, according to background information in an American Academy of Otorhinolargyngolo Head and Neck Surgeons release announcing the study results.\nAt the start of care, all patients' disease had been evaluated at a minimum of two sinus centers in their area and none had needed a CT scan or surgery (endoscopy-assisted endoscopic surgery) previously.\nThese patients were assigned to two groups of about 30 patients: Those who received amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily for 14 days), a standard treatment for rhinusisitis; and those who took a yellow, round, placebo pill of similar size and color. In addition to this \"sham-placebo treatment,\" the drug patients received a packet of antibiotics to take home with instructions to continue taking them for", "I don't have time for all this. Just get me antibiotics to treat and cure sinus.\nNo, I do not recommend you antibiotics for the treatment or cure of sinus because in the end you will not cure your sinus and instead end up damaging your whole body in a manner not possible to put back together.\nAntibiotics are chemicals used to kill bacteria and thus antibiotics should be used against bacteria-caused disease only. Antibiotics should never be given to the body unless there's a reason and in this case there should not be any since it's not a bacteria but a virus in question. Also, your immune system will never learn to build immunity to this disease and there will be need to be repeated dosages that always end in side effects at some point (if they don\u2019t even from the beginning) because your body will grow resistant to them and you may be forced to use more antibiotics which is always bad.\nWhat I therefore recommend that you treat your virus caused sinus with natural remedies that can be easily found at home and that are harmless. They are also cheap and are made from vegetables and fruits that we cook and eat every day.\nDo you want to cure and treat sinus that will last at least 20-30 years or would you rather just mask sinus' and feel bad?

Some antibiotics have a bad reputation but are sometimes necessary. Can you tell us which one (s) you've been on and had a reaction to? Also I would check with your pharmacist / MD to make sure there is no risk for drug interaction taking 2 antibiotics at one time.", "I'm almost done with that cold, just can't breathe and I have a bad cough already that is making me feel sick...\nWell, it depends on if it is viral or bacterial.\nIf it's viral, you shouldn't take antibiotics.\nAntibiotics only work on bacteria, and won't do anything for a viral sinus infection. An over the counter decongestant plus plenty of fluids, some rest and a humidifier might also help.\nIn the mean time, a neti pot and use of warm salt water to flush out the nasal passages might help, too.\nI'm always skeptical when my MDs recommend antibiotics for my colds. It seems like every other cold I get an MD suggests Cipro in my case (strep). It does seem to help clear it up, but I feel it just gives more of a boost to the body to fight the cold when the immune system is already fighting it.\nOne thing I've also found really helps clear up the sinuses is staying upright. I read something that says the mucus that forms in the lungs and the sinus, etc. is supposed to drain downwards, so that when I lay down, the mucous and germs are allowed to stay in a stagnent and warm environment, rather than it being allowed the gravity to move downwards and out through the drainage. When I am on my periods, (which, if you don't know happen every month), I often suffer a chronic cold that will turn into a sinus infetion, almost like a seasonal thing. Now I try to sleep as upright as possible and it seems to actually help a lot. (Yes, I will go to bed on the pillows under my feet, propped up on a bunch of pillows until I doze off.) Now when on medication, there will often be a little 'warmness' in them and, yes that feels better, because, as Dr. Greene says 'the mucs is trying to warm itself up so it can move out and drain.' It also helps to drink LOTS of water and hot fluids.\nYes. The netti pot, my humidifeer and sinus pills made a world of difference to me in clearing up a cold and that nasty congested cough. Plus, when you are congesteed you just need something to clear out your breathing when going to be sick of your stomach. There was no need for an anti biotic. Just try the humidifer and nettie pot.\nNettie"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1818, "rouge1_r": 0.2609, "rouge1_f1": 0.2143, "rouge2_p": 0.0153, "rouge2_r": 0.022, "rouge2_f1": 0.018, "rougel_p": 0.0909, "rougel_r": 0.1304, "rougel_f1": 0.1071, "bleurt": 0.3666, "bert_score_p": 0.8421, "bert_score_r": 0.7851, "bert_score_f1": 0.8126, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4697, "rouge1_r": 0.1466, "rouge1_f1": 0.2234, "rouge2_p": 0.0534, "rouge2_r": 0.0166, "rouge2_f1": 0.0253, "rougel_p": 0.2121, "rougel_r": 0.0662, "rougel_f1": 0.1009, "bleurt": 0.3404, "bert_score_p": 0.817, "bert_score_r": 0.8125, "bert_score_f1": 0.8148, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3485, "rouge1_r": 0.1223, "rouge1_f1": 0.1811, "rouge2_p": 0.0305, "rouge2_r": 0.0107, "rouge2_f1": 0.0158, "rougel_p": 0.1591, "rougel_r": 0.0559, "rougel_f1": 0.0827, "bleurt": 0.2656, "bert_score_p": 0.777, "bert_score_r": 0.8014, "bert_score_f1": 0.789, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3106, "rouge1_r": 0.1541, "rouge1_f1": 0.206, "rouge2_p": 0.0153, "rouge2_r": 0.0075, "rouge2_f1": 0.0101, "rougel_p": 0.1515, "rougel_r": 0.0752, "rougel_f1": 0.1005, "bleurt": 0.3158, "bert_score_p": 0.8065, "bert_score_r": 0.781, "bert_score_f1": 0.7935, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 37.5}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.1591, "rouge1_r": 0.1522, "rouge1_f1": 0.1556, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0909, "rougel_r": 0.087, "rougel_f1": 0.0889, "bleurt": 0.2678, "bert_score_p": 0.8144, "bert_score_r": 0.7775, "bert_score_f1": 0.7955, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 37.5}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.303, "rouge1_r": 0.0964, "rouge1_f1": 0.1463, "rouge2_p": 0.0229, "rouge2_r": 0.0072, "rouge2_f1": 0.011, "rougel_p": 0.1515, "rougel_r": 0.0482, "rougel_f1": 0.0731, "bleurt": 0.2737, "bert_score_p": 0.7901, "bert_score_r": 0.7931, "bert_score_f1": 0.7916, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 37.5}]}

{"Question": "Could diabetes be so fast and onset?", "Free_form_answer": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease that affects the body's ability to use blood sugar for energy. It is divided into two main types: type 1, which typically starts in childhood and is caused by the body's immune system attacking the pancreas, and type 2, which usually starts in adulthood and is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. The onset of the symptoms of type 1 DM such as weight loss, higher urination quantity and frequency, excessive thirst, fatigue, and others, can be very quick and appear over weeks or even days. Less commonly, a medical emergency called diabetic ketoacidosis can develop over hours with symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing, and feeling very ill. Diabetes mellitus type 2 usually progresses over years, and the majority of patients are asymptomatic at presentation.

Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce insulin. Insulin is the hormone that allows glucose to enter the cells of the human body and be used for energy. Without insulin, glucose builds up in the blood, leading to high blood sugar levels. This can cause serious health problems, including blindness, kidney failure, and heart disease. Diabetes is one of many diseases that can be caused by a lack of insulin.\nType 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is caused when the pancreas does produce enough insulin or when cells do not respond to insulin properly. In type 3 diabetes (also known as gestational diabetes), pregnant women develop high levels of blood glucose due to hormonal changes during pregnancy. Gestational Diabetes can lead to complications for both mother and baby if left untreated.\nDiabetes is not a disease that you can catch from someone else. It is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when your body\u2019s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in your pancreases. The pancrease is responsible for producing insulin which helps regulate blood sugars levels in our bodies. When these cells are destroyed, they cannot produce any more insulin and this leads to diabetes.\nThe symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, slow healing wounds, tingling or numbness in hands or feet, dry skin, yeast infections, erectile dysfunction, etc. If left unchecked, diabetes can result in serious complications such as heart attack, stroke, blindness and kidney disease.\nThere are two types of Diabetes: Type I and Type II. Both types are caused due in part by genetics but there are other factors that contribute to the development of each type. For example, Type One Diabetes occurs more often in people who have a family history of this disease while Type Two Diabetes tends to affect those who are overweight or obese.\nIn addition to genetics, lifestyle choices also play a role in determining whether someone will develop either form of Diabetic Mellitus. People who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol excessively, eat a lot of processed foods, or do very little exercise are at higher risk for developing either type of DM.\nIf you have been diagnosed with Diabetes, you may be wondering what the best treatment options are for you. There are many different types and treatments available, so it is important to find out which one will work best for your individual needs. Here are some of your options:\nInsulin injections: This is probably the most common treatment for Diabetes.", "Dr. Aung explains\nOne of my recent patients had been struggling from type 2 diabetes. She was always thirsty and urinting so much, and she felt very tired all the time. Her glucose level was high as her glucose meter reading showed. Blood test showed that her blood sugar was 200 (the normal range is 60 at the beginning to 100 after an overnight fasting). I checked my pulse and her ankle jerks were weak, which suggested possible nerve damage. The first symptom, thirst, was the result of high concentration of glucose in blood. Then her body was using her stored energy source (such as body fats) which was not a wise decision. As the glucose was stored in the liver, the person was tired and exhausted. I gave her some medical advices, such as eating the right food to control her diabetes as I explained in my previous post. Besides this, she asked my personal oppinion on other methods of controlling diabetes, as it was getting worse day by day.\nAs her condition was worsening, it meant that the high blood pressure and diabetes were caused by a hidden infection in one of her vital organs. Infections in any of the internal organs would cause the whole body to be unhealthy as the immune system was occupied by fighting against such an infection, instead of focusing on maintaining the health of other organs in our body. If I can clear the infection within her liver or kidneys, her conditions would become significantly better. Hence, my mission would be to get rid of diabetes through finding the cause of it.\nShe came back five days later. This time, with her energy and vitality were 10 times improved; she looked much healthier and brighter than before. And her appetite also improved. One more interesting point in her visit is that she now told me that another person in a family developed diabetes with the onset of 3 weeks. Diabetes normally takes years to come, so a fast onset was suspicious.\nThis story showed up something very interesting. We all have read from the online resources that diabetes usually takes at least 8 years before coming. With my medical knowledge, I knew this was a big lie. Some of you may think that doctors were not trustworthy. But actually, no doctor would like to do such false information just to attract the public attention. Sometimes such a misleading information could end up with deadly results.\nI would also like you to know that although there are many books and online health information about the disease and it\u2019s treatments, that does NOT imply", "The answer is YES!\nIn a previous issue of The Bulletin, we addressed an important health topic: metabolic syndrome. (see The Bariatric Bulletin 1:9-12, 2010)\nThere are many ways in which this condition affects the health of an individual. Here are few examples:\n\u2022 Cardiovascular disease: 50% of premature cardiovascular deaths are diabetes-related.\n\u2022 Diabetes and vascular dementia: one of the most well-known risk factors for vascular demetia.\nWe now know that diabetes can be a very rapid disease in certain individuals. If diabetes was just a chronic condition, it would be easier to cope with. But in some cases, individuals with type 2 diabetes are progressing toward a severe metabolic disease within only a few months.\nAn article published in 2009 in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology provides a detailed description of a case of severe diabetes in a woman whose age was unknown. During a routine health check, the patient\u2019s blood glucose level was measured at 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL). This is a level that is usually only observed in someone undergoing dialysis. The patient had a fast glucose lowering effect with insulin, and the doctor started to treat the rapid diabetes.\nFrom day six, she started with a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and an insulin tolerance. With the GTT, glucose is injected into the bloodstream after an overnight fast. There are at least two conditions under which the test is performed: first, if the individual has a fasting blood sugar level of 8 mmols/L or higher, then testing is done every 15 minutes. Secondly, a normal individual would have a blood level below 7 mm. A normal response might be that the blood levels drop to 4 mm and then rise slowly to about 6 mm over the next few hours.The individual in this case had an initial level drop of about one mm to just below seven mm after 30 minutes and was then very high at four mm.\nThe insulin test was administered after the glucose test. In this test, insulin is administered with the same procedure as the insulin bolus. Again, in normal individuals, blood should drop in one minute to four mg. It is possible to have an even faster drop, but if an uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is present, than the drop will be much higher before the rise begins, just like the diabetes patient in question. Thus, this individual\u2019s glucose-lowering response to insulin had been severely impaired. Her doctor,", "If so please try and help\nIt\u2019s very hard to believe or comprehend how a new diagnosis of diabetes could affect me. It was only a year ago when all was normal, I was eating sensibly, doing all the right things and feeling fantastic. My diabetes was diagnosed in May 2011 only 13 weeks after I had been treated for throat cancer. I did not know the cause of my cancer but now I have to wonder if it was not diabetes related. During treatment which consisted of three months of radiotherapy with daily tablets for nine months I lost over two stone in weight in three weeks and felt as if I could run a marathon. There was a bit of weight gain over the next few months but by the time of diagnosis only another few pounds. Since then the weight is piling on again. Could my diet be right? It is all high protein and low carb, like my diabetic diet is now supposed to be. Also since May my health has gradually taken a turn for the worse, my legs have become very weak now, have difficulty walking the dog and climbing stairs. At the start of it all I thought that it could be the radio therapy and the tablets. The doctors agreed but the symptoms have only got worse since I started on insulin injections two months later just before diagnosis.\nCould this be caused by eating out a lot more and going to restaurant for business? Could it be due to lack of rest and exercise during work? I tried to jog off to run. But then I got cramp and my fingers get pinched off and cold. So how can a doctor diagnose me and what is it exactly? Why does he need to know where I live? And will there be much to learn? What else can it do for me? Do I get a diagnosis sooner for other things? Does diabetes often get discovered this way?\nWhat can I do about the diabetes?\nHello and welcome back to the community. As you can see your post is very similar to one that I wrote a couple of weeks ago. People have responded. Try asking your doctor exactly when it is you want to see him/her. For instance if you have been told that your diabetes is insulin dependent then go and see a consultant or specialist in order to get good diabetes management. If you are confused about what the doctor said then get it clarified.\nHi Thanks for your reply\nThanks for reply. They have given me a diabetic appointment in a month's time to talk about my HbA1c results", "Yes, it can be fast, as Type 1 diabetes starts the moment the pancreas stops making the hormone insulin, and without insulin in the body, the cells of the human body can\u2019t properly take in to use the glucose that the rest of your body makes from digested food, this leaves them in high blood sugar.\u00a0\nThe risk for Type-1 Diabetes is genetic, although the exact risk is not known. Some cases are caused by other issues like viruses, chemical exposure, stress and drugs that cause an autoimmune reaction.\nWhat are the warning signs for type-2 and type 3 diabetes?\nType 2 Diabetes has very similar warning signals and symptoms to Type One Diabetes like increased appetite and thirst, weight loss, fatigue, hunger and frequent urination. These symptoms don\u2019t always develop right away and most of them can come and go. Sometimes people with prediabetes or those at risk develop symptoms, while others never discover they have the condition until years later.\nHow to lower the risks?\nThere are some simple things that a person can do to help control some of diabetic symptoms and lower risks of diabetes. Losing weight, exercising and eating a healthy diet is critical in helping you control the disease.\u00a0 If you are a family member of someone with diabetes, there are risk factors like predabetic symptoms like weight and blood pressure can easily be checked or by contacting your doctor to set up an exam.\nThere is no cure for diabetes and there is a lot to learn, but taking steps to lose weight or control blood pressures and taking the small steps like eating healthier and exercising is the way to take to make small changes to your health that can make a change for the better.\nThe key to life with type one, type two or type three diabetes is to eat healthy, exercise and know your numbers and the most important thing is managing how to live with it.", "What about gestational diabetes?\nThere's nothing fast about type 2 diabetes. It takes time for a person's insulin resistance to change and for their pancreas to lose its ability to make adequate insulin. If a woman has GDM, then she has pre-diabetes which could lead to type II diabetes in the future. You should absolutely be getting routine physicals and lab work as directed by your doctor to evaluate your medical status.\nDoes diabetes cause early onset osteoporosis?"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5281, "rouge1_r": 0.2186, "rouge1_f1": 0.3092, "rouge2_p": 0.1412, "rouge2_r": 0.0583, "rouge2_f1": 0.0825, "rougel_p": 0.2528, "rougel_r": 0.1047, "rougel_f1": 0.148, "bleurt": 0.381, "bert_score_p": 0.8325, "bert_score_r": 0.8536, "bert_score_f1": 0.8429, "hallucination": 27.27272727272727, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4607, "rouge1_r": 0.1859, "rouge1_f1": 0.2649, "rouge2_p": 0.0734, "rouge2_r": 0.0295, "rouge2_f1": 0.0421, "rougel_p": 0.2079, "rougel_r": 0.0839, "rougel_f1": 0.1195, "bleurt": 0.3224, "bert_score_p": 0.8094, "bert_score_r": 0.8301, "bert_score_f1": 0.8196, "hallucination": 54.54545454545454, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.427, "rouge1_r": 0.1818, "rouge1_f1": 0.255, "rouge2_p": 0.0734, "rouge2_r": 0.0312, "rouge2_f1": 0.0438, "rougel_p": 0.191, "rougel_r": 0.0813, "rougel_f1": 0.1141, "bleurt": 0.2762, "bert_score_p": 0.8055, "bert_score_r": 0.8297, "bert_score_f1": 0.8174, "hallucination": 27.27272727272727, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4101, "rouge1_r": 0.1608, "rouge1_f1": 0.231, "rouge2_p": 0.0395, "rouge2_r": 0.0155, "rouge2_f1": 0.0222, "rougel_p": 0.1966, "rougel_r": 0.0771, "rougel_f1": 0.1108, "bleurt": 0.2586, "bert_score_p": 0.7987, "bert_score_r": 0.8131, "bert_score_f1": 0.8058, "hallucination": 63.63636363636363, "comprehensive": 57.14285714285714}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5449, "rouge1_r": 0.2922, "rouge1_f1": 0.3804, "rouge2_p": 0.113, "rouge2_r": 0.0604, "rouge2_f1": 0.0787, "rougel_p": 0.2416, "rougel_r": 0.1295, "rougel_f1": 0.1686, "bleurt": 0.3191, "bert_score_p": 0.8358, "bert_score_r": 0.8564, "bert_score_f1": 0.8459, "hallucination": 27.27272727272727, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.1629, "rouge1_r": 0.358, "rouge1_f1": 0.2239, "rouge2_p": 0.0169, "rouge2_r": 0.0375, "rouge2_f1": 0.0233, "rougel_p": 0.0787, "rougel_r": 0.1728, "rougel_f1": 0.1081, "bleurt": 0.29, "bert_score_p": 0.8498, "bert_score_r": 0.8247, "bert_score_f1": 0.8371, "hallucination": 54.54545454545454, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}]}

Mononcleosis is a virus so there shouldn't be a problem swallowing. Most of the times people with monucleosus dona't have swollen glands. Regarding the esophageal condition (esophageitis) this inflammation can be the result of a viral or bacterial infection or can happen due to the gastro-esofageal reflux or the ingestion of some caustic substances (acids, alcohol, causteic drugs, etc)\nIn general, the condition does cause chest and throat pain. Other manifestations are: retrosternal burning (burning in a way that you feel it is coming from your chest), bloating, nausea, regurgitation, difficulty to swollow.\nYou must go for evaluation by a gastroenterologist, he will do a good exam of your throat in depth and will examine if the inflammation goes until the upper sphincter of you esofagus. Then, he'll examine your barium swallow (X-ray with drink that passes through you tube and outline the inner surface) to evaluate your upper esefagus.\nIf no problems were found, than don\u00b4t worry, it has a chance of getting better (most of these problems will get better spontaneously- it the time that the body needs to regenerate it\u00b4s tissue cells).\nIf your doctor suspects of reflux, you can even try to treat it during a while and observe if it helps you. I would recommend not to make any changes before an endoscopy, even if there is good response to your treatment.

Could you explain how this works?\nPremature ejaculation is a common problem that affects many men. There are many different treatments for premature ejaculations. Serotonergic antidepressants are one of the most common treatments. They are also known as SSRIs. SSRIS are a class of antidepressant medications that work by increasing the amount of serotonin that is available in the brain. This is done by blocking the reuptaking of this chemical. The more serotonin available, the more likely you are to have an orgasm. In addition, SSRs can also help to reduce anxiety and depression. These are two other factors that can contribute to premature orgasm.\nSSRI medications are often used to treat premature orgasms. However, they are not the only treatment for this condition.

This can lead to memory losses in depressed people. It is usually in two ways in which depression has effect on memory. In the first instance, the reason is that one feels depressed as a result of memory problem, and in second one the depressed person feels memory difficulties, because their mind is always in constant turmoil, due to mood swings and low emotional state. Thus they are unable to function adequately, as well as remembering the things properly.\nThe effect is mostly seen after the major incidents of their life. Most of the cases they feel a loss of long term memory, but many of them suffer from short term or working memory that may cause problems in their daily life, in particular the person who are very dependent on their memory or the individual whose job highly depends on the memory.\nDepends on you, when depression can cause memory impairment? The main factor to consider is the severity of depression and the length of time, which can change with the different age of person. More severe depression at age 60 can have more impact as compared to severe memory depression from early 30\u2032s. If the depression is less severe along with more frequent the impact of mood changes, stress as the root of forgetfulness.\nSome of causes that affect depression or mood can create the effect of impaired recall. For example, a depressed individual may feel the difficulty with recalling names or simple directions, while they may have no problem with remembering more complicated information like the long poem, novel, or long sentences.\u00a0The most important key for a patient who is suffering from depression related memory issues is to treat his underlying depression condition by therapy, support and drugs.\nIt has been noticed that cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are mostly successful in getting rid of this difficulty. These therapies target the patients, who have not done well with anti-depressant medication, especially in moderate to mild depression. Therapy is more important to deal with depression because memory can get adversely impacted with prolonged depression, even if the patient is medicated.\nHow to Treat Depression?

However, these are also the diseases which are in most cases misdiagnosed as depression. Since a majority of the population believes depression to mean only extreme sadness, it is difficult to imagine how depression can be a cause for dementia or any other neuro degenerative diseases. This article will enlighten you on what precisely the relationship between the two is. It will also answer the question \u201chow can memory problems and depression have a connection?\u201d\nIs Depression a Sign of Alzheimer`s Disease?\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease is often wrongly believed to cause symptoms that are quite similar to depression, which actually in turn is the main symptom of it. Many people believe that depression is an emotion and not an illness which can result in Alzheimer, rather Alzheimer is a brain disease, and it results in depression as one of its symptoms. The symptoms of depression often occur at first in an elderly person suffering from Alzheimer\u00b4s Disease. People are unable to recognize its onset and this hinders the diagnosis, as the disease is typically misinterpreted as a depression and the brain problems are not being detected in time.\nDeprescription\nWhat should I do after being diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2018s Disease? The first thing you have to do is to follow your doctor\u2019s advice and take all the medicines prescribed for treating Alzheimer. Depression is one among the various symptoms which needs to get treated. At the same time, you need to undergo a good therapy to avoid misinterpreting your symptoms as only \u2018depression\u2019. To do so take assistance from someone with extensive experience, who can make the difference between depression therapy and dementia therapy.\nHow Can They Be Related as Two Different Diseases?\nMany studies have been done relating depression with cognitive and behavioral symptoms, where it was also found that the subjects were having a high risk of developing dementia. Although the causal factors were not identified, depression was found as having an impact with the speed of memory decay as also on the chances of an individual having memory issues in his early 60s or after. Those having depression had an increased risk rate of 67% to develop the symptoms such as short-term memory disorders, mood and cognitive disorders. These factors, in short, were the only factors which were found linking Alzheimer to dementia and vice versa. There was no direct link, however, the above are believed by the researchers to have an indirect connection", "Can depression be treated?\nDeposits that appear white in colour. This is the most widely occurring type of gallstone. People suffering from gallstones of cholesterol deposits should avoid animal fats, high fat dairy products, fried foods, and alcohol.\nGallstones are little masses that form when bile in the gallbladder solidifies. Bile is a fluid that removes wastes from the liver. Gallstones can be classified as either cholesterol or pigment stones. Pigment gall stones usually appear brown or black and are more common in people with certain blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or cirrhosis.\nThe symptoms of a gall bladder disease depend on the severity and the nature of the disease. In some diseases, the symptoms might be obvious, while in some other diseases no symptoms may be evident at all. The main symptoms include biliary colic, which is sudden intense pain that lasts from 20 minutes to a few hours, jaundice, fever, diarrhea or chills and loss of appetite.\nBile, a chemical in urine that normally helps digest food in intestines, contains cholesterol. When the bile becomes too concentrated and cholesterol levels rise, stones form.\nIn some cases, no identifiable cause is found.\nDepend upon the location of stones on gallBladder, treatment may include: Antibiotics, to cure any infections.

When we are talking to our friends or colleagues, we always use some information related to them.\u00a0 We can remember them to have red hair, wear glasses or can recall specific experiences with them etc. We normally keep such memories up to a month, it may be due to some social gatherings or a dinner with an old friend we have to remember the last meeting and the context of it to talk about it. Normally\u00a0our brain stores the information of important life related events with specific context to know what and when and where, so in this way we can easily understand if our brains have dysfunction and we start missing some or lost\u00a0all the memories.\nResearchers from University of Cambridge found that people who are suffering from depression have poorer memory when it comes to social or emotional situations rather than other types of memories. Researchers explain these types in two parts; one is emotional memory to be able to understand the emotions of a person, and social memory, to recall the facts of where and how it happened. They observed the activity of the brain and found a relationship between memories and depression.\u00a0\nResearchers performed a study on 44 people and asked them about their own memory with some questions. For each patient, they selected five most significant events of life and five social events. These were asked in the form of detailed, non-emotional and emotional questions, each in four parts.\nResults of research demonstrated that when a patient was depressed, then there was a decrease in both memories, especially in recalling the important social and non-social events.\nAfter that a group of patient\u00a0of depression was divided into two groups; in one the medicine was administered, while in other remained normal. At the end of study, researchers found interesting results. Those taking medicine had more memories than compared with group 2. In the normal group, two-third of patients did not show any improvement. This means that depression can make memory lose, but with the help of medicines its effect can be lessened.\nHow to cope with long term COVID-19 symptoms\nHow can I take care of my mental health\nAll about the importance of mental well being\nI am suffering, I think I need medication\nWhat is the treatment for bipolar disorder?", "- 1011\nResearch - New evidence shows that the more severely depressed you become, the greater your chance of suffering from memory impairments.\nThe study's lead investigator, Daniel Maixner, Ph.D., an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Houston (UH).\nHe says: \"There is growing acknowledgement that depression is often a precursor to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. What is new here is that evidence is mounting that depressed people may be more susceptible to memory losses in the brain,\" Maixer said.\nResearchers analyzed the results of brain test performed on 50 people who had shown symptoms of a lifetime of depression, at least half of their lifetime. They took three different tests to see how well parts of memory functioned in four areas of the participants. brain.\nOne, an auditory memory test, which assesses the ability to hear and hold a message and then repeat it back. Participants heard lists of three to seven words and had to remember them to be repeated back in numerical order. For example, if they heard the words \"apple, banana, orange, grape, watermelon, coconut\" and \"watermelon,\" they would have to count on their fingers to identify numbers one through seven in order, then recall \"apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, and coconuts.\"\nThe second test -- the Sternberg Memory Test -- requires the participant to listen to a set phrase and have a specific word in mind as well as the exact number of items contained in a string of words. Then they must identify that number in relation to the set string, recalling an item from the string and its place in terms of position, for example \"2, 5.\"\nAnother test involved recognizing pictures of faces -- a test of visual memory. Research participants saw the faces and were asked to name them later.

Cheap socks are not only uncomfortable, but they can also cause a variety of problems. In this blog post, we will discuss the different problems that can be caused by cheap, low-quality socks. We will also provide tips on how to avoid these problems and choose the best socks for your feet.\nWhat are cheap Socks?\nCheap socks can cause many problems, including:\n1. They can make your foot sweat more.\n2. The material can irritate your skin.\n3. You may get blisters from them.\n4. Your feet may feel cold and uncomfortable in them all day long.\n5. If you wear them for a long time, they may cause your toes to become numb or even fall off!\n6. And finally, cheap sock materials can contain harmful chemicals that could be absorbed through your pores and into your bloodstream, which could lead to health problems down the road!\nHow do cheap and low quality socks affect your health?\nThere are many reasons why cheap or low-grade socks may be harmful to your overall health. For example, if you have diabetes, wearing cheap cotton socks could cause you to develop foot ulcers or other foot problems because the material is not breathable enough to keep your body temperature regulated. This can lead the bacteria that causes these conditions to grow and spread throughout your system, causing serious health issues down below.\nAnother reason why wearing low-cost socks might be bad for you is because they don\u2019t provide enough support for the arch of your shoe. Without proper arch support, you\u2019re more likely to experience pain in your heels and ankles when walking or standing for long periods of time. Additionally, without proper support from your shoes, your legs will be forced into an unnatural position which can put strain on other parts of the body like the back and hips.\nFinally, another reason cheap shoes might not be good for us is that they often don't last very long before they start falling apart. When this happens, it can leave us with blistery feet and even worse, open wounds that are susceptible to infection. So if we want to stay healthy and happy, then we need to make sure that we're wearing quality shoes that will last us a lifetime!\nWhat is the difference between cheap vs high quality Sock?\nThe difference is in the quality of materials used to create them. High-quality sock manufacturers use high-quality materials that provide better support and comfort for feet. These materials also help keep feet dry and cool, preventing blistering and other problems associated with cheap materials", "There is no definite yes or no to this question. Even among the famous manufacturers, the price of the same pair of socks varies for various styles, colors, and sizes. Some of them are less expensive than others. Does price play a role in how much your feet will sweat?\nIt is essential to use socks that are durable and can bear the extreme environment that the foot must withstand. The sole of your shoe will also be prone to friction, abrasions, punctures, or worse, burns from the sun. Using socks will help protect your shoes' sole against harm during wear and tear.\nThe type of fabric used in sock production is significant because it will determine how comfortable your socks are: Cotton is generally regarded as the most absorbent fabric because of its ability to absorb moisture. But if your job requires that you stand in one place for a long period, a thick pair will be best suited. Nylon tends to be more durable than cotton.\nCotton fiber is spun from cotton plants, while synthetic fibers are made from oil or coal-derived ingredients. As a result, synthetic socks can cause rashes and irritations if you\u2019re sensitive to substances derived from petroleum or chemicals. Cotton socks may be better suited for those who have had difficulty wearing them in the past.\nWhen choosing your next pair, consider how long you plan on wearing these socks. If they will last through an hour of work or running, then a nylon sock may suffice. However, if they\u2019re just meant to protect the bottom sole, then you\u2019ll probably find that a cotton sock will do. These are designed to wear longer and remain cool, even if wet.\nFinally, decide what features you want in a pair.\nFor example, some people prefer their socks to stay up during exercise because they feel more secure and comfortable. Other people will not wear them at all when they go out for the day. Consider what your preferences are before purchasing your new pairs.\nAre wool socks bad for rashing?\nWhat is the main issue with cheap work boots?\nHow Do Cheap Boots Lead to Rashes on the Feet?

Whether it\u2019s just a pair for your summer adventures or a serious road race in July, it matters how you protect your feet. But if you want to get a cheap sock, is there anything wrong with that? We will discover the answer that is really worth the money.\nCheap does not mean bad\nYou may have heard many people say that cheap means bad. This is certainly not true. A cheap product generally does more to keep your mind off it for long periods of time. When you buy a product at a lower price, you are more likely to be disappointed. The manufacturer is just following the standard guidelines and doesn\u2019t have the resources to make it more exciting. You could get something cheap that would be useless. Or you could be pleasantly surprised and get the best value for money. On the whole, cheap isn\u2019t bad \u2013 it just isn\u2018t cheap.\nA cycling race can be hard on your body and you need the right gear to stay safe. In the past, if your cycling socks weren\u2019t 100% moisture resistant and allowed your skin to sweat or get too hot, this was not an issue. Socks were inexpensive and simple and designed to fit your shoes. Now that we\u2019ve entered the age of technology and innovation, cycling enthusiasts demand the latest design features in the products they buy. Although they have more protection for their feet, they also have a different style. As these new features come with a price tag, some cyclists who can\u2019t afford to break their bank accounts are left wondering where the market is for affordable socks.\nWhy do socks matter?\nCycling is a sport that can leave your legs sore and tired if not handled properly. For this reason, the socks on the feet must be comfortable and provide the appropriate amount of moisture and protection to prevent blisters. If you choose a comfortable pair of socks, then you have less chance of blistering.\nCyclists should wear a good pair that provides adequate protection if participating in a race or competition. Most cycling competitions require competitors to wear socks that protect their skin and prevent them from getting blasters.

If you wear them and they wear to the skin or wear off the top you will get blisters and other things on your skin.\nPoorly manufactured socks in which the elastan threads are poorly embedded and the fibers quickly wear away are going create problems.\nMost people wear cheap uncomfortable socks because it is too expensive and a luxury item.\nFor the last six months I haven\u2019t been able to wear a sock that wasn\u2019t too warm. My feet were getting hot in the afternoon and sweating, no matter what socks I tried, even the lightest weight cottons or whatever was left. Finally, I did the research and found that the nylon is probably the biggest sweat inducer for me. So I went to a pair of the ultra light weight socks, and this last week it has not been too bad. And I may not have put the blame on the socks before, but it\u2019s a good thing my feet aren\u2019t cold, that\u2019s for sure. No one wants to be cold!!\nI was wearing socks of different patterns and colors that I would wear with sandals. One day, while playing tennis, my toes kept hitting the sides of my shoes causing pain. On careful inspection, it was evident that there were lumps in just the side sock portion of one shoe which was causing the toes to hit the shoe. By trial and error, we determined that it wasn't what was worn that day that had caused the problem, merely that one size was too small but could go with another pair that was a bit smaller and would get tight. The next time a similar incident occured, by the color and pattern of what I was wearign, could tell that these were the same socks. Then I realized that not only did one pair have a lump in it that caused toes hitting a shoe but almost all of them had a slight lump of sorts. There were no obvious lops or loose stitches. Most only had one or two areas that were slightly raised and could be felt when running my hand over the entire sock. These socks are made in Ecuador by a company called Baggallini. (I don't recommend) The socks were bought online at the Amazon.com", "How do you treat a fungal nail? These are the type of questions that people may be Googling while in your store. And they can\u2019t find an answer.\nThis is where you need to offer your expertise. In your shoe store, customers rely on you when they have a foot-related question. If your customers turn to you for the answers that they need, you will earn the relationship and the return business that comes with it. You can provide an informational, easy-to-follow handout to educate your patients, or you might want to start a blog that will offer some expert advice.\nHow to Find an Expert Witness?\nWhen you are in need of an expert in an area that you do not specialize in, this can be a real issue. The problem is that this situation occurs frequently during a lawsuit. This is because lawyers and insurance companies are more comfortable with hiring experts of their own choosing to perform the independent investigation.\nThe truth is, the court needs independent testing to confirm or negate the charges you have brought forth. But finding an independent witness that is unbiased and willing to work for fair pay is sometimes a problem. Before you go ahead and bring charges against a company, it is important to understand the process that court-ordered experts go through.\nWhy an Independent Expert is Needed.\nAn independent expert is needed to provide a third-party opinion that both sides can agree upon. These independent witnesses are brought in to prove the truth in a case and to avoid the biases of the judge and jury.\nOne thing to keep in mind is some judges are actually more predisposed to side with their insurance carrier than they are to helping your insurance company. Because of this, an impartial expert may have to be called in so that your side is properly defended.\nIt is not uncommon that a court-appointed witness will have information about the subject company that he has already determined to not be true. It also isn\u2019t uncommon for a biased witness to have ties to the insurance industry or the company.\nHiring an Impartial Expert.\nIf you find yourself needing independent testimony, your first step should be to contact a firm known for impartial experts. Most courts don\u2019t allow you to hire an \u201cexpert\u201d yourself, so you\u2019ll need an unbiased agency to do the research for you. Independent expert firms usually do this for free in exchange for 50% of your winnings.\nThese agencies will find and hire unbiased experts on a number of topics but medical issues are among their most common jobs. Many agencies also have databases of experts that are able"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6408, "rouge1_r": 0.1477, "rouge1_f1": 0.24, "rouge2_p": 0.1373, "rouge2_r": 0.0314, "rouge2_f1": 0.0511, "rougel_p": 0.301, "rougel_r": 0.0694, "rougel_f1": 0.1127, "bleurt": 0.3307, "bert_score_p": 0.8215, "bert_score_r": 0.8552, "bert_score_f1": 0.838, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.6019, "rouge1_r": 0.1632, "rouge1_f1": 0.2567, "rouge2_p": 0.1569, "rouge2_r": 0.0422, "rouge2_f1": 0.0665, "rougel_p": 0.2816, "rougel_r": 0.0763, "rougel_f1": 0.1201, "bleurt": 0.3036, "bert_score_p": 0.8271, "bert_score_r": 0.8644, "bert_score_f1": 0.8453, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5049, "rouge1_r": 0.1179, "rouge1_f1": 0.1912, "rouge2_p": 0.0784, "rouge2_r": 0.0182, "rouge2_f1": 0.0295, "rougel_p": 0.2816, "rougel_r": 0.0658, "rougel_f1": 0.1066, "bleurt": 0.2886, "bert_score_p": 0.8028, "bert_score_r": 0.8409, "bert_score_f1": 0.8214, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5922, "rouge1_r": 0.1359, "rouge1_f1": 0.221, "rouge2_p": 0.1176, "rouge2_r": 0.0268, "rouge2_f1": 0.0436, "rougel_p": 0.301, "rougel_r": 0.069, "rougel_f1": 0.1123, "bleurt": 0.2721, "bert_score_p": 0.8163, "bert_score_r": 0.8467, "bert_score_f1": 0.8312, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4854, "rouge1_r": 0.1099, "rouge1_f1": 0.1792, "rouge2_p": 0.0784, "rouge2_r": 0.0176, "rouge2_f1": 0.0288, "rougel_p": 0.2816, "rougel_r": 0.0637, "rougel_f1": 0.1039, "bleurt": 0.2824, "bert_score_p": 0.8019, "bert_score_r": 0.8423, "bert_score_f1": 0.8216, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4272, "rouge1_r": 0.0961, "rouge1_f1": 0.1569, "rouge2_p": 0.0784, "rouge2_r": 0.0175, "rouge2_f1": 0.0286, "rougel_p": 0.2621, "rougel_r": 0.059, "rougel_f1": 0.0963, "bleurt": 0.2839, "bert_score_p": 0.7984, "bert_score_r": 0.8248, "bert_score_f1": 0.8114, "hallucination": 87.5, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

While all head pain is bad, these head pains are considered headaches, and there are specific types of headaches that need different treatments. The headache pain that you're feeling can be from many things that irritate your head. These head ache treatments vary depending on your age, sex, lifestyle, medical history, general health and many different factors.\nA migraine is classified as a severe headache that can last from several hours to days. They can occur sporadically or more frequently, usually lasting from 2 to 72 hrs. There are two types: migraine with aura and migraine without aura. A migraine lasts from some hours or days, but it comes in three stages: prodrome, aura (seizures, trouble speaking) and headache (throbbing, intense, one sided). Headaches can involve many triggers and are classified accordingly. You should see your physian and tell her if you have any specific triggers or if the headache happens at a specific time of day. Certain medications, like oral contraceptives or NSAIDS and alcohol or caffeine withdrawal can cause them at different times. Most headaches don't require medical attention if they're not recurring or severe. If they are, they should be evaluated. Medications may include:\nover-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen, for mild to moderate pain.\nprescription painkillers, opioids like hydrocodone or oxycodone, if other treatments aren't effective.\nSome headaches are chronic. Chronic headaches refer to those that are frequent and last longer than an average. Some chronic headaches can have debilitating symptoms that cause serious disruptions in your daily routine. Here are some of the most common types:\nTension headache: Most common type, can feel like a tight band around your forehead and head.\nMigrant headaches: Affect both sides of your temples, forehead & neck; migrates around the head and can spread down the neck.\nCluster headaches (episodic) can happen more than 5 times per week and over 15 times in 6 months. Treatment options include preventative and abortive (stop pain) medications.\nCaffeine Headcahes: Drinking too much caffeinated coffee or other caffeine containing beverages (tea, soft drinks, etc.) can produce headaches in susceptible", "I only get migrains.\nCan migranes cause blurry vision?\nDoes anybody know what could be causing the severe headaches and blurred vision.", "My eye is twitching, my head feels foggy, but no headache.

You can try to switch to an organic diet without too much sugar, alcohol or any stimulants. It will help. Also try some natural remedies.\nIt sounds like a combination of things to me... stress triggers hormones that create the problem... add a good probiotic to your intake, and exercise at least 4 or 5 times a\u00a0 week... also try eating foods that are high in Omega 3... flax, chia, walnuts, etc... and cut out foods with dyes.\nWhat are your medications and how often. I only say that because I noticed a big reduction from a drug I used to take until I added vitamins and minerals with my other medications. But not sure if that will happen with you. You might also consider the medication and if it could be a factor. Also drinking alcohol too ( not necessarily from drinking it, but from it depleting nutrients). Hope your doing better though.\nMigraines can be brought on by lack of sleep, low blood sugar, weather changes, dehydration and stress. I have had migranes for many years so I do think it is genetic as well as those things I mentioned.\u00a0 The best thing I found to do is stay regular on my meds which I take for my blood pressure\u00a0 that also stops the migrane. Taking extra calcium helps. Lots of fluids, good eating habits, exercise, good mental health, all are important. There are some herbal teas that my daughter swears by.\n\u00a0I can only give you what I would do for a really bad headache. Get some warm water, add some Epsom salt ( if you don't have any around add something else for the salt like baking powder or Borax or something). I put my feet in and soak them and keep it up while getting some sleep. Sometimes, I mix in a drop of Lavender oil too.\nThere are different types:\nClassic migraine is severe, throbbing or pulsating pain on only one side of the head usually lasting from four to 72 hours, if untreated. Accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which can sometimes be severe enough to cause dehydration, with photophobia (extreme sensitivity to light) and phonophobia", "Is just the right posture important \u2013 as I have been told it helps with pain from different parts of the body? Or do you have any suggestions for natural medicine / yoga etc?\nA yoga practice that includes backbends, and forward folds may help you tremendously.\nYoga is a fantastic tool to use to prevent migranes, but it cannot cure you. You need to see a doctor to get help with this.\nThe problem with migrane is that once the head begins to spasm it is not easy to calm things down in the brain. What we can do is to make suggestions to help before the migran begins, or to slow down the progress of a migrne.\nDo a regular yoga postural flow and take a yoga for migrang routine as well. I would recommend you see Dr. John Sarno for a consultation.\nSarnos work is the best thing on the market for any kind of pain, not just for headaches.\nI\u2019m 15 years old and last year\u2019s Christmas I became deathly ill (still don\u2019t know what it was, because no type of doctor could help me). All I was doing was throwing up blood. No food, liquid, nothing whatsoever could stay in my stomach. One night I drank a 7-Up, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it down. It was the first time in a month that any liquid had stayed in me. But after drinking that one 12-ounce can, I started to throw up a black goo with blood mixed in it. And then it hit me, it felt as if my veins were filled with molten lava or something, burning and throbbing in pain. My entire body felt like it would just explode. The pain was indescribable, almost like labor. Everytime I moved my body, the worst pain imaginable hit and it made me scream. After around ten weeks, my skin turned a reddish brown and all the hair on my head turned white. Around this time, Dr\u2019s finally started helping me and I found out I had a viral infection. Slowly, each month the pain got better, until I reached July. Then it started all over again, same exact thing, everything happened over and over for another four months.\nOne month after it finished, a huge blister appeared on top of my chest. Inside was a thick white liquid. A doctor had told me that if they had to biopsy my lung tissue, they found huge holes, which means", "If you feel that you may need to have a neurological exam, please request an appointment with a neurologist. The following information will come in handy to help you navigate your symptoms and avoid frequent headaches. Some causes of migrane are food allergy, poor dental hygiene and lack of sleep. There are numerous causes, including stress, fatigue, hunger, or any other thing you can think of. Migraines may last from 4 to 72 hours and commonly begin to resolve after the person lies down in a dark, quiet place. I have suffered from migranes my whole life as well, they are debilitating and I feel hopeless and defeated. My eyes are sensitive to light and sound. This is called an aura.\nIf you think you have migrains, try these 7 natural remedies to reduce headaches and migraines, fast! This means using strong smells such as camphor or menthol will make it worse. Many sufferers are given the wrong painkillers, and these can actually make their headache worse and delay relief, while the painkiller simply masks the headache symptoms, rather than curing them. When a person experiences a migraine, pain receptors are triggered. How to Prevent MIGRAINES It may sound as cliche as the advice about wearing a seat belt, but practicing regular relaxation, stress management, exercising, getting sufficient sleep and sticking to a regular eating and sleeping schedule can help prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. If it is just a headache, I take an aspirin.\nMigraine attacks may be preceded by sensory disturbances such a lightheadedness,,, and speech problems. Also if you use perfume, just make sure you don't use it near someone who has a headache or a weakness to smells. These headaches can occur as part of a syndrome, meaning a group of symptoms that suggest a cause. But if I still have nausea and other symptoms I will lay down so I can rest.

You can also refer to it as Xanax.\nMany women wonder if they take it before they get pregnant if this might affect their fertility. I don't really know of any studies that are going to be able to give a definitive answer to you on this, in part, because there's many factors that determine when someone can get or stay pregnant. So one study that might look at alpraxolon and fertility might not include everything else that could impact your ability to get fertilized or sustain a pregnancy.\nAnd if it doesn't impact one particular study, it may not really be a big issue to consider when you're trying to conceive. But you really should talk to your doctor about this. Because it sounds like you've been diagnosed with anxiety and the doctor, you know, is the best judge of, of this medication and if you stay on it and how it's going for you. If, if, after a period of time, they want you to stay off the medication to try to focus on other ways of dealing with your anxiety. Talk to them about what your concerns are about conceiving on the Alprox, the alproxalon. And also, have you been evaluated for other options. There are other medications that you may be switched to which may actually give you a better result and a way to treat your particular condition that is going and to allow you be more relaxed and feeling better about your pregnancy and in your life. That's not necessarily going over to this particular kind of medication. Have you talked to a therapist about working on some relaxation techniques and other types of therapies?\nSome of these medications can cross the placenta and be very difficult to wean off once the baby is born. My mom is a pharmacologist. She's now retired. Many of you were aware of that. In fact, just before I got pregnant, a woman asked her if there were medications she should avoid if she was planning on getting pregnant and she looked over the prescription medications. One of them in particular was, was Xanex. Now this is not to say necessarily that they will have a detrimental affect on your baby, but just because your body might have trouble weaning", "My husband and I have been trying for a while to get pregnant and there are many factors working against us. Is there anything that can reverse this?\nUnfortunately, it's not possible to reverse or prevent male infertility in the large majority of cases. Allopuirinal doesn't damage sperm but there aren't very many drugs which have much effect. And some affect the sperm adversely. However, we're currently developing a new drug which appears to be able to rescue male fertility in as high as 30 percent of infertile men.\nUnfortunately there's very little that we can do currently, other than treat for obvious causes like infections where they're likely to succeed. There are treatments which could prevent fertilization, such as vasectomy or a surgical procedure called a vasoepididymostomy, but these have their limitations, both because they are permanent, and because if you do get successful fertility then this means that you will need to have this reversed as well!\nThe best thing is to go and see your doctor and check that there isn't anything treatable causing your infertility, then you can get a better idea as to how high your chances of getting pregnant are in order to help judge how you should proceed.\nThe Sperm Doctor\nI've been having trouble in bed lately with my wife. She says it happens to her all the time for no reason. I just feel uncomfortable and can't get myself motivated. We've tried different positions and lubricants, nothing is working.\nIt's pretty common for women to not get off properly, if at all, from time to time. But if this is a regular problem, there may be reasons why this could be happening. One thing to consider is that some men may not be using positions that are good or suitable for their partner - although this seems pretty unlikely in your case. Another possibility is the lubricant - perhaps your wife prefers you to try another brand (this is especially so if she's using a spermicide lubrication).

However the same study claims that 6.6 attacks per month is not very common with less than half the survey taking the time off work due to migraine. On top of this they also said that only 8.8% claimed their workplace had put rules and regulations in place to deal with migraine sufferers. That comes out at one headache a day for seven days in every month. Reference: when do headaches get worse.", "Is migraine a neurological disorder? We answer these questions and more.\nHere are all the facts you need to know about this painful, chronic condition.\nYou\u2019ll know a severe migraine attack once you have one. In addition to the intense, pulsing, throbbing pain, you also might have nausea, vomiting, confusion, and extreme sensitivity to light and noise.\nHowever, not everyone has these same symptoms. Some people might experience an aura (odd sensations or visuals like blurry vision, double vision), whereas others might not.\nIf the pain lasts four to 72 hours and occurs a minimum of 15 days per month, it could be classified as a chronic migraine.\nSome migraines can completely debilitate a person, resulting in days of complete inactivity. Others last 24 hours or less. This will depend on a number of factors, including if you take medicine.\nIn addition, the frequency and severity of migranes also can change \u2014 and the location of the head pain might move from one side to another.\nMigraine is a type of headache, in that it causes pressure and pain in the areas of your head, neck, jaw, or scalp. Many people also develop nausea or an uneasy stomach.\nThere are two kinds of migraine \u2013 episodic and chronic.\nThis is characterized by four or more attacks lasting four hours up to days (72+ hours). This form is much more common than the chronic form.\nAnother way of putting acute versus chronic is that acute migrains occur once a month or every four weeks. Chronic migraneurs experience two migrainous attacks or episodes a week.\nHow Does One Get It?\nGenetics seem to be involved, with migraine typically running in many families. The condition is thought to have a biological and neurological basis, which can be influenced by environmental factors.\nFor example, a study found that those who get migrines are more genetically predisposed to having low levels of sodium in their CSF fluid.\nChronic migraine treatment is divided between treatments for acute episodes and preventive treatment. Acute treatment aims to stop a headache episode. Preventive care seeks to avoid migranas by addressing the root problem instead of reacting to it and treating the symptoms.\nAcute medicine can include prescription drugs like amitriptyline, nortriptiline, phenelzine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. However, these are only to treat symptoms and not the underlying condition, so in some cases, they can bring some unwanted", "A migraine with aura can occur 2\u00a0times per week, and usually each episode lasts between 3\u00a0and 8\u00a0hours. But migraines lasting an extended period of time are quite common, as well. For example, a 2014\u00a0 study \u00a0reported that migrainers can be left in pain for between four\u00a0days and almost four weeks.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, it's almost impossible to predict how long each attack will last, so it can sometimes be difficult to plan ahead for things like work and appointments. In the next sections we'll go over some ways to get some control over your migraine and to manage this\u00a0unpredictable disease.\nWhy do some migrains last longer?\nResearchers think that some of these attacks are prolonged\u00a0by the way the brain resets after each migraine attack. When a person has a normal headache or a tension-type headache, the process of recovery goes as follows:\nThe headache dissipates.\nNeurotransmitters become imbalanced.\nIt takes time to recalibrate and reset.\nAfter this reset period, they will begin to experience the first signs of another headache: dull throbbing,\u00a0a sense of pressure across the forehead, or the pain increasing until the symptoms reach a peak and then begin dropping again\u2014this is typical of a common\u00a0 headache.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf that reset process doesn't work properly, your neurotransmitters may remain out of balance, leading to migraine. However, during this time your headaches can intensify.\nThese prolonged migrines fall under the category of chronic migraine, \u00a0in which migraine episodes occur at least twice weekly for three\u00a0months or more, which equates to about at\u00a0least 15 days per month. You can learn more about chronic migrain, including symptoms, causes, treatment, triggers and prevention, in the\u00a0article, What is a Chronic Migraine?\nHow do migrinds end?\nIf a severe migraine continues beyond its typical length, then it becomes called status migranois (aka the worst, longest, head-smothering migraine you can possibly imagine!).\u00a0\nThis debilitating condition, also known as \" protracted or\u00a0 prolonged migraine \", can last\u00a024 hours or longer. At this point, most people who get them will do anything to stop the migraine from continuing to the point of stopping everything and taking one\u2019s life in their own hands.\nUnfortunately for those of us who experience chronic headaches\u2014whether it\u2019s a prolonged headache episode or not\u2014symptomatic relief from pain medication alone is not", "\u2013 DailyRx\nThe Mayo Clinic describes a typical migraine attack as \u201can intensely painful headache that is often accompanied by dizziness, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity and other symptoms.\u201d These symptoms can often last a day or longer, and are often debilitating.\nBecause their symptoms last longer than most headaches, with some patients suffering for up to 24 hours, migraines are viewed by many as the world\u2019s biggest headache. Some people have trouble working during a full-blown migraine. For others, a mild migraine can be treated with ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain relievers.\nAlthough the exact cause of migraine is still largely unknown, it\u2019s known that the condition is highly hereditary.

It is also known as bronchopneumonia. Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an infection of the lung caused by a fungus called Aspergillus.\nWhat is the difference between broncho and pneumonia? \u00a0 Pneumonitis is inflammation of lung tissue, while pneumonia refers to inflammation and infection in the alveoli. Pneumoconiosis is lung disease caused or aggravated by inhalation of dust. Pulmonary fibrosis is scarring of lungs.\nCan bronchioles become infected? \u2013 Additional Questions\nWhat are the 4 types of bronchoscopy?\nWhat does bronchodilator do?\nBronchodilation is defined as the widening of air passages in your lungs. This allows more air to flow in and out of your airway. This can help you breathe easier. Your doctor may prescribe a broncodilating medication to help open your bronchia.\nHow do you treat bronchie?\n  1. Antibiotics. If you have a bacterial infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics.\n \u2019t take antibiotics for viral infections.\nAntibiotics are not effective against viruses.\nIf you take an antibiotic when you don\u2019t need it, you may cause bacteria around you to become resistant to antibiotics and more difficult to treat in\nHow long does it take for bronches to heal?\nMost cases of acute bronitis will clear up within 2 to 3 weeks. However, if you are over 45, have chronic broncitis, or have other health problems, it may take longer to recover.\nDoes drinking water help bronche?\nDrinking plenty of water and other fluids will help thin the mucus in a person\u2019s lungs and make it easier to cough up. A person should also avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can dehydrate the body.\nIs bronchtis contagious?\nAcute bronchalitis can be contagious. It\u2019s caused when a virus or bacteria infects the lining of a lung\u2019s air passageways. The infection causes inflammation, which makes it difficult for air and mucas to move through the passways. Acute means the condition is short-term.\nWhy do I keep getting bronchetis?\nThe most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is smoking. Other causes include long-term exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, and dust or fumes found in some", "The short answer is yes, it can, as the two often manifest from the same initial conditions.\u00a0There are key points to consider between bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\u00a0\nThe main difference between lung inflammation bronchopneumonia and acute broncho pneumonia is that the former has been known to occur as a complication of acute infection. For example, someone with influenza may have their symptoms exacerbated or worsened by the bacterial infection, leading to increased inflammation and lung damage.\nThe broncheal tubes and the lings are affected when the person has broncopneumoonia. This affects the breathing and can make it difficult for you to breathe. So to make sure of what bronco pneumonia looks like, the symptoms are wheezing and coughing with mucus. Shortness of breath is also a symptom of bronopneumonias.\nIn contrast, when a person is diagnosed with bronkis, which is another bronclitis condition, they do not have any symptoms of a cough or wheeze. There are some other things that you can do in order to help yourself when you have a bronkopneomoni. Do something that increases your heart rate as well as your breathing rate, such as running or yoga. These would help you open up your lungs and clear them out.\nBut what about chronic bronc pneumonia, can it still be considered a lung infection? Well it depends, most people think so however there are people who believe that its a different disease. According to the World Health Organization, chronic pneomonia is an inflammation or infection of the tissue around the bronchioles and bronchia that is caused by bacteria or viruses.\nSo the answer to our question, 'Is broncobronchial infection pneumonia?' depends on how chronic it is. In other words, if you suffer from chronic infection for a long time, then the term 'broncobranc infection' can be used to describe your situation. But if your broncodonial pneumonia lasts for less than three months, you may want to look for other symptoms in treating your symptoms.\nIf you're looking for more ways of how to get rid of lung and throat infections, there is one more thing you should know about: the use of antibacterials and antifungals. Antacids and antibiotics are typically used as treatments for bronchodnial infections. However, these medicines don't help when it comes to treating pneumonia symptoms such infections.\nAs we've mentioned before, one way to tell if", "The short answer is no. But it is possible for bronchiolitis to turn viral into bacterial pneumonia. Bronchial pneumonia does not occur in babies with cystic fibrosis. There is a clear connection between bronchopneumonia and tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of death from acute broncho-pneumonitis among children in low-income countries. Chronic bronchio-pnemounitis can cause permanent damage to the lungs in both early and later stage.\nBoth viruses and bacteria can attack the respiratory tract, but viruses have the capacity to spread quickly through the body by causing a sore throat, cough, runny nose, muscle aches, headaches, vomiting and diarrhea. Viral pneumonia symptoms range from mild to severe, depending on how much of your respiratory system is infected. When it comes to acute respiratory distress, viruses are the main cause and bacterial pathogens are responsible for up to 50% of all cases of viral pneumonia.\nIn general, there is much greater chance that the symptoms of pneumonia are caused by bacteria than there are of finding them in the nose. If your symptoms last more than two days, seek medical attention. The treatment and prognosis of bronchipneumonic pneumonia is determined by the type of disease and where it occurs.\nBronchoplex pneumonia can occur at many different ages and is more likely to occur with pre-existing bronchodilation (such as asthma). Babies can get pneumonia from a fever caused when the bronchia are exposed to viruses. Babies less than six months old do not have all the immune defenses that children have developed between 6 and 12 months. This means that babies are more exposed than older children, especially during the winter months.\nA common and sometimes fatal complication of the disease is broncobronchospasm, or acute chest syndrome. To diagnose pneumonia in a newborn, doctors look for signs and tests such as fever, lab results, white blood cell count, imaging scans and a chest x-ray. Other diagnostic tests that can be used include an sputum culture and Gram stain. Doctors will also try to rule out the possibility of bacterial infection by analyzing the spongy mucus found in your lungs, known as mucociliary clearance.\nHowever, it can occasionally cause serious complications, such broncopneumopathy. Severe pneumonia infection can lead to death in young children. Many cases improve with antibiotics alone, usually with amoxicillin. However, severe pneumonia that affects more of their respiratory systems may require higher doses, intravenously and", "Most of the time, yes.\nCough, chest tightness, sputum and fever are signs of bronchiolitis. Antibiotics aren\u2019t recommended unless pneumonia sets in.\nBronchial Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs that causes them to break out with pockets of moisture or pus. This is a dangerous situation that can cause lung tissue to die. In the first two days after infection, people usually cough up thick, sticky mucus from the lungs. Then the muck gets thinner and more watery. Pus gets stuck in the throat, and a cough gets worse. You may experience chest congestion, shortness of breath, a headache and muscle aches. Coughing with bronchioitis causes pneumonia to be less severe. It is also a sign that your immune system is responding well to the infection.\nWhat Antibiotic For Bronchiectasis?\nAntibiotics for bronchodilators to treat pneumonia are used to prevent the spread of infection to other people, although they don\u2019t protect against death from broncho-spasm (pulsus). If you get sick from pneumonia, your doctor can prescribe antibiotics to speed healing and prevent more severe lung damage. If people have other chronic health problems like COPD, asthma and lung cancer, for example, pneumonia can trigger a flare up. People with COP may have COP, so they should check with their doctor before taking antibiotics.\nIs Chronic Bronchietasis A Lung Condition?\nIf the bronchia are affected, bronchoscopy is usually used. The airway tissue inside the larynx has been affected by chronic lung disease. Most common respiratory diseases develop in a person who is chronically ill with asthma or COP. They also cause a variety of health issues. Chest pain, wheezing and coughing may be caused by a combination of cold and asthma. Asthma symptoms include coughs with muffled sounds, rales of wheezy sound and racking cough. These signs and symptoms have not been found in non-asthmatic patients. Broncho, the smallest of blood vessels in these cases, is the primary source of chronic pulmonary disease.\nAre Antibacteria Drugs Useful For Chronic Colds?\nAlthough it may feel like getting cold all the way down to your chest, it is likely that you have a viral infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. But a cold is not a bacterial infection. There is no evidence that antibiotics are effective in relieving the symptoms or shortening", "Yes, pneumonia can develop in the lungs or sinuses after bronchiolitis, leading to life-threatening complications that sometimes require surgery. But children with these conditions can usually recover within a few weeks with appropriate treatment. There are currently no vaccines and there are no specific drug classes approved for the treatment of bronchoconstriction.\nCan Bronchial Asthma Be A Serious Problem?\nIn the worst case, you may have severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or the inability to cough up secretions. Some infants get bronchopulmonary dysplasia at low weights, but very low birth weight babies (<1,500 grams) are at much higher risk of developing the problem.\nWhat Does It Mean If Your Baby Has Bronchiectasis?\nAlthough bronchioles can lead to infections in later life, most babies will not develop bronchiecoagulant. However, some babies may develop severe broncophorephthal, making it difficult to breathe and/or cough secret.\nIs Bronchoalveolar Pneumonia Serious?\nBronchioarthritis is a serious and sometimes fatal condition in which the infection is the result of the body\u2019s ability to break down or use carbon monoxide. The lungs and airways are severely damaged and cause a decline in lung function, which can be life threatening.\nDoes Asthmatic Bronchodilation Go Away With Treatment?\nSymptoms do not go away but can worsen as the disease progresses. If an asthma attack is mild to moderate, the use of quick-acting medications at home and in a healthcare setting will stop the attack. This is called a rescue medication or symptom medication.\nAre The Risks Of Bronchiovascular Pneumoconiosis Serious During Childhood?\nThe prognosis for many with broncopulmonitis is good, although the severity of children in low resource settings depends in part on the quality of medical care available. Bronchopneumoin can take a heavy toll on your lungs, especially your respiratory system.\nWhen Is It Necessary For A Doctor To Diagnose Bronchiepneumosclerosis During Coughing And Shortness Of Breath?\nCough. A cough that lasts more than five weeks. You have chest tightness, short breath or pain most of your days or at least twice a day. Your fever is as high as 100F for more five days, even if there\u2019s no fever.\nHow Do You Tell If A Baby\u2019s Breathing Is Normal?\nA typical breathing pattern: Babies breathe about 40 times a minute", "Pneumonia often appears soon after a bout of acute bronchiolitis in winter. Both conditions are common in children under 2. Acute bronchoitis happens when a cold or virus causes the airways to swell. The swelling leads to wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath.\nWhy do many pneumonia cases start as a bronchopneumonitis? \u2013 Additional Questions\nWhat type of pneumonia is most common?\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most frequent type, accounting for the vast majority of cases, often around 75% or more.\nWhich is more dangerous pneumonia or bronchodilators?\nBacterial pneumonia usually hits suddenly and can be extremely serious, as it can quickly cause the bronchioles and alveoli to fill with pus and mucus. Viral pneumonia can also be very serious. When symptoms begin, they can progress into a severe situation extremely quickly.\nCan pneumonia come from bronchie?\nBronchial obstruction and chronic broncheitis. Aspiration, airway obstruction, and atelectasis can cause pneumonia.\nWhat is broncheonema viral or bacterial?\nIt is caused by a viral infection and the inflammation can eventually progress to pneumonia if antibiotics are not used during the initial infection.\nHow many forms of bronchal pneumonia are there?\nAspiration is also thought to play a significant pathogenic role in about half of all patients with CAP. There are two forms : exectorator (or lobar) pneumonia and bronchenoema (interstitial or atypical) pneumnia.\nIs pneumonia a secondary condition?\nSecondary bacterial pneumonia refers to bacterial infection of the lung parenchyma after the preceding episode of viral illness or pulmonary inflammation from other noninfectious condition. It is well known that secondary bacterial superinfection occurs soon and rapidly develop into full-blown bacteremia (8,9).\nIs a bacterial or viral pneumonia more common with the flu?\nSeasonal influenza outbreaks during late fall and winter can make a person susceptible to developing bacterial pneumonias. A wide variety of bacteria can infect the lungs in this manner, but the ones most likely to cause a pneumonia include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumonia.\nWhen can pneumonia turn to bronchet?\nWhen a child with a bad cold breathes out, he makes noises such as \u201cssss\u201d, and he gets louder and louder. This is called wheeze, bronchosss and is usually due to small changes in the windpipe and small"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.1332, "rouge1_f1": 0.2103, "rouge2_p": 0.1134, "rouge2_r": 0.03, "rouge2_f1": 0.0474, "rougel_p": 0.2653, "rougel_r": 0.0707, "rougel_f1": 0.1116, "bleurt": 0.2925, "bert_score_p": 0.8132, "bert_score_r": 0.8607, "bert_score_f1": 0.8363, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5102, "rouge1_r": 0.1266, "rouge1_f1": 0.2028, "rouge2_p": 0.0722, "rouge2_r": 0.0178, "rouge2_f1": 0.0285, "rougel_p": 0.2551, "rougel_r": 0.0633, "rougel_f1": 0.1014, "bleurt": 0.3075, "bert_score_p": 0.8111, "bert_score_r": 0.8511, "bert_score_f1": 0.8306, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5816, "rouge1_r": 0.1418, "rouge1_f1": 0.228, "rouge2_p": 0.1237, "rouge2_r": 0.0299, "rouge2_f1": 0.0482, "rougel_p": 0.2245, "rougel_r": 0.0547, "rougel_f1": 0.088, "bleurt": 0.3257, "bert_score_p": 0.8145, "bert_score_r": 0.8616, "bert_score_f1": 0.8374, "hallucination": 22.22222222222222, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4898, "rouge1_r": 0.1234, "rouge1_f1": 0.1971, "rouge2_p": 0.0722, "rouge2_r": 0.018, "rouge2_f1": 0.0289, "rougel_p": 0.2449, "rougel_r": 0.0617, "rougel_f1": 0.0986, "bleurt": 0.283, "bert_score_p": 0.8122, "bert_score_r": 0.8599, "bert_score_f1": 0.8354, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5408, "rouge1_r": 0.1395, "rouge1_f1": 0.2218, "rouge2_p": 0.0309, "rouge2_r": 0.0079, "rouge2_f1": 0.0126, "rougel_p": 0.2041, "rougel_r": 0.0526, "rougel_f1": 0.0837, "bleurt": 0.3151, "bert_score_p": 0.8047, "bert_score_r": 0.8576, "bert_score_f1": 0.8303, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4694, "rouge1_r": 0.1247, "rouge1_f1": 0.197, "rouge2_p": 0.0928, "rouge2_r": 0.0245, "rouge2_f1": 0.0387, "rougel_p": 0.2347, "rougel_r": 0.0623, "rougel_f1": 0.0985, "bleurt": 0.3358, "bert_score_p": 0.8068, "bert_score_r": 0.8525, "bert_score_f1": 0.829, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

The virus can be transmitted through sexual contact, including oral, anal, and vaginal sex. It can also be spread through skin-to-skin contact with an infected person.\nHerpetic lesions are usually found on the genitals, but they can occur anywhere on your body. They are often painful and can cause itching, burning, or tingling. The lesions may be small or large, red or white, raised or flat, smooth or rough, with or without a crust.\nThe most common symptom of herpes is the appearance of a blister or sore on or around the genital area. These blisters or sores are called \u201cherpes soles.\u201d They usually appear on one side of the body, such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, inner thighs or inner arms. Sometimes, the soars are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye.\nOther symptoms of genital herpes include:\n\u2022 Painful urination or difficulty urinating\n\u2022 Burning or itching in the urethra\nIf you have genital soares, you may also have other symptoms, depending on where the lesions occur. For example, if the lesion is on a finger, it may cause pain when you touch it. If the sore is in your mouth, your tongue may feel sore or swollen. You may have a fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain or swelling, rash, itching or burning.\nIf the blistery soare is located on an area of your skin that has been exposed to sunlight, then you will probably have sunburn. This is because the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays can damage the skin cells that are infected with the virus. Sunburn can make the blistering soarer worse.\nYou may not have any symptoms at all. In fact, many people with genital herpess do not know they have it until they develop symptoms. Some people may only have mild symptoms and not even know that the infection is present.\nThere are several types of herps. Genital herpes can affect both men and women. There are two types: herpes type 1 (HPV-1) and herpes\nhow long does it take for herpes to show up, how long after exposure to herpes do symptoms appear, what is herpes 2, herpes symptoms in men, can you get herpes from kissing", "Are you having problems with this one issue? If you are, you don\u2019t have to be sad anymore since you have come to the right one webpage here. Right here in the subsequent paragraphs you will learn about the truth of rectum herpes. Hopefully, this will help you get rid of the worries right immediately or whenever possible.\nDoes Herpes Have Rectal Discharge\nIt\u2019s been very normal to feel concerned about any matter that may affect your life. But it\u2019s better to always stay informed with what exactly you expect in a specific issue. For this particular example, it will be nice to know everything about your problem with herpes and its symptoms.\nSo, how about we start?\nIs there a possibility that you can get herpes in your rectums?\nFor any question in this matter, no matter how sensitive it is, one must always start his/her research from credible resources. And on this topic, the CDC or the Centers for Disease Control have their findings regarding this. The agency has found that the HSV 1 (herpes simplex virus type 2 and 3) infection can really be spread to all parts of human\u2019s body.\nIt even indicates that a person may have a serious chance of getting herpes simplex infection at rectals and anus.\nHow do we know it?\nIt can be found in those who have or ever had sexual contact with an infected partner with the herpes virus. Thus, someone who has ever engaged in unprotected sex with someone infected with HSV will surely experience or even suffer from rectus herpes.\nOther than the obvious possibility of having this disease through unprotected sexual intercourse, HSV can still be transmitted from the anus to anal area. This could be through contact like touching another partner\u2019s mouth or anus. It can also be during unprotected vaginal and anal sex.\nThe symptoms of herpes can vary significantly between men and women who suffer it. In women, vulval area or vaginal area are the mostly affected parts in their body. Their anal and rectusal area could also develop herpes blisters. Men are likely to get it in genital and penile area, but on rare occasions, anal herpes may occur.\nAlso, those people who are suffering both genitals and oral herpes could possibly get this problem in rectuses and anuses as well.\nFor that reason, men should protect their anus from any chance to meet another infected person\u2019s genitals or mouth and the same process is also important for women.\nIf it has already occurred, what does herpes look like in anal?\nThis particular herpes problem, like any", "[closed]\nI am a 21 years old male. Two days back I realized one thing which is that my anus always feels swollen. So one day, I asked my mom about it and she said it might be because of having intercourse, so she told me that I should check for discharge coming out of the anus and if any, to seek help.\nI checked right then and there and then, not even half an ounce of discharge came out from it, but still, for 2 days now I am having the same problem. But this time, when I checked, a small amount of white discharge comes out.\nNow I googled about this and found one particular website, where I read that it can either be herpes or rectum inflammation. But as there is no real proof, only theory. And one more thing, how to be 99% sure?\nI have a herpes test pending and I will let you know what I had. That's the real reason I came here to say it's because I thought I might have herpes if my test is positive.\nThank you for answering. I also thought that might happen. The reason behind I didn't ask for an appointment is I'm a little scared if it is herpes, which isn't wrong. If it was herpes and the test was positive, then I would only know it after a few days. Even if I ask what it be. Anyways, the only thing you can do is wait for it but please answer this question if possible \u2013\u00a0 Ankit Feb 28 at 3:39\nHow old is the first time for intercourse?

In most cases this is not sexually transmitted but is usually associated with poor oral hygiene as mouth and anus share some common bacteria.\nAnother very frequent issue is hemorrhoids, in particular in those with constipation which makes the stools larger and less soft. In many cases these are just an irritation of a tissue (or even small blood vessels) due to the pressure from larger solid stools. It is an inflammation but not usually due viral reasons.\nBoth rectitis and herpes show white to white-yellow snot but you could take swab and check if your doctor can examine it.\nIn fact, with the description you provided it looks like hemorrhoid. With hemorrhoidal puffy anus there can be small", "What is a herpes rash? Can a mouth ulcer spread herpes? When will herpes be gone? If I had an incident of genital herpes, is it OK to have intercourse with someone 5 days prior to the incident and also during the 3 days of symptoms to a week after the last day of the sore?\nHerpes is caused by a virus, and the virus can stay in your body forever. Herpes may be very mild, you may have symptoms only occasionally or not at all.\nWhen you first have the infection, it can appear with just very small red bumps or a few little blisters on the lips, vagina or genitals.\nIt can also affect the buttocks, rectum, neck, eyes -- anywhere there is skin (even the mouth and throat).\nIf it spreads all over the skin, the rash might look like poison ivy. The rash or sores might be watery, yellow or have a crusty appearance.\nWhat do herpes soles look\nThe so-called cold soaks in the bath are also suitable for other forms of herpes. In general, one distinguishes between two forms: type 1 and type How many days Herpess it take Herpees herpes on a body part usually between five and ten days, but the incubation period can be many weeks.\nSometimes there are recurrences without a trigger (prodromal) in Herpees form, type two only shows up in connection with a sex partner, whose genital areas are already affected with the disease.\nIf one does not notice the so much attention to it when the first symptoms appear, he will get it for a long time or permanently. Recurrent infections caused, so that in an acute outbreak of so on other parts of Herpetis body Herpertis. Because Herpges is so contagious, herpes zoster should definitely not be made Herperis contact with other people, because the contact is easily infected.\nAlso the areas around the blistres should be kept very moist, since even minor irritation can cause Herppes relapse Herpedes the herpes virus from the nerve cells.\nAn unhealed crust must therefore be avoided, otherwise it would continue to spread the inflammation. It is also recommended to wear cotton underwear or cotton pads to protect the genitals. One avoids a heat rash in addition to that of a direct friction with clothes with synthetic fibers.\nThis can lead to an itching or stinging at the affected places. If Herpses get red inflamed areas at one place,", "What causes rectum soars?\nMy boyfriend is having a problem with his rectums and has had some discharge lately. At first I noticed it was clear and then we have noticed blood in it. He had to use a bidet after the fact of taking a laxative and there was blood. Is he bleeding in his anus and colon?\nFirst of all, blood should not come out from the anus or rectus during defecation. That can only mean that there is another problem that causes blood to ooze out of the rectius. You can visit local hospital or make an appointment with a doctor to have further evaluation.\nHe might not have any problem at all. It can be caused by rectosigmoid endoscopy, bleeding of internal hemorrhoids, anal fissure or other problems in rectis.\nIf you really interested, there are simple examinations we can do:\n1. Examination of blood components (including blood type) - You should know, because it is not possible in the absence of any bleeding from rectil.\n2. Microscopic examination of feces - We can observe the fecal components and the microorganisms that are present, so that we know whether there might be intestinal diseases to be examined further.\n3. General urine test - These include urine examination, including uric acid level\n4. Blood examination - including fasting blood sugar, creatinine and urea, liver examination and kidney function tests.\nBased on blood examination results, we may do a blood stool (stool blood test). This examination is an effort to know what is the blood disease in question.\n5. Ulceroscopic examination (UGI / endosoensy) or colonoskopi\nWhen these examinations are negative, with negative history of abdominal mass, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, then there would be no suspicion so it may be considered normal variant (without pathology). But if you still have doubts, then it would help to do further tests, such as chest X-ray, bone marrow examination or blood culture.\nBlood in your stool or discharge is a sign of bleeding. Bleeding could signify a number of problems. Usually, it indicates that the anal sphincter has been torn, which would cause more severe pain. Inflammation (anal fissures) can also occur but these are more common in women and are accompanied by constipation, itching and pain.\nIt can make sense to seek prompt medical attention when having an episode of diarrhoea and blood", "What are its Causes?\nA person may find discharge from the rectum during an episode of genital herpes caused by HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus type 2) or anal sex with herpes simplex type (HSV-1) 1 after a person has been infected. Many people may be wondering if herpes has a discharge in the anus. In this article, we will discuss all symptoms of herpes, what can cause it and some other possible diseases or infections like herpes. The following article discusses what causes anus to have a foul discharge and will also provide an in-depth answer to the question \u201cIs it possible to discharge rectally after having a relationship with a sexually transmitted disease?\u201d.\nWhat Causes Herpes?\nHerpes is triggered by the herpes disease, specifically herpes \u00a0simplex virus 3 (sometimes recognized to herpes genitalis) and herpes virus number 4 (which can be recognized as herpes zoster). The virus attacks the human cells in both instances. Although we are looking for the \u201czoster\u201d component, it is the zozotic virus.\nCauses of discharge after anal intercourse\nA. If rectaly\u2019s discharge has nothing to do with an STD, and if there are no traces of the discharge as well as no accompanying symptoms, the risk of spreading the infection to others is usually low, but it should be taken into account. Sometimes the causes of rectely discharge may not be caused a serious disorder, such as a common stomach problem such a diverticulitis, a colon disease. Or a less serious issue like a urinary tract infection (UTI). While rectly discharges are typically caused an infection on account of sexual transmission, this does not usually happen outside. There is a small chance that a disease might be transmitted, depending on its kind and the location where the person was infected.\nA few examples of potential sexually transferred infections include:\nIn the last few years, there has increased risk factors between the rate of chlamydia and gonorrhoea. The symptoms are quite similar and they do not show up right away however. While having the gonorrhea infection it\u2019s more likely to develop into a painful infection in your anus, which is called prostatitis that can occur. A gonococcal infection can spread to your bloodstream. This infection is very dangerous to some people.\nThis illness can result from a viral or bacterial type in herpes transmission.

I have very low blood presure and am wondering about hydroxyzine side effects.\nComment by liz 2 hours\nHxY does not have a direct effect of raising blood-pressure. However, hydroXYZine is a sedative drug, and like all sedatives it can indirectly raise your blood\u00a0 pressure. This is because, while under sedation the activity of nervous system decreases slightly, which means that the\u00a0blood\u00a0 vessels can dilate and your heart can beat slower (slower heart beat leads to lower blood flow, therefore less force). In the long run, taking a low-dose of HXY\u00a0 is actually beneficial for regulating your\u00a0 blood \u00a0pressure.\nAre there any other medications that will counteract the drowsiness from hydroxzine? Would having my sleep-wake cycle altered help with this drowswiness?\nanswered 3 months ago by\u00a0 Nastyas\nWell, not many. The ones we know of (and some of them are pretty weird) are: nabilone, diphenhydramine, desloratadine [2], and ketamine. Having your sleep schedule altered from the norm will help. Also, switching to\u00a0hydroXYZamine (I believe the dose should be the same) would help as well.\nAlso, I'm not sure who said that, because Hxy (like almost all medications) induces dextrocardia. HXYZ, for example, induces a dextral axis. Dextrophobia is the fear of being right-handed.\nIf I take Hydroxyzin, to sleep, will sleeping well prevent any withdrawal symptoms and/or will it diminish the severity?

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including weight loss. In this blog post, we will discuss the link between low levels of thyroid hormones and weight problems. We will also provide tips on how to manage your weight if you have hypothyoidism.\nWhat is hypoythyroid?\nHypothyroism, also known as underactive thyroid, is when the body does produce the amount of hormones it needs. The thyroid is responsible for producing hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, and development. When the gland doesn\u2019t produce these hormones, the result can be weight issues.\nThere are a few different ways that hypothroid can cause weight to gain. First, when there is not enough of the hormone thyroxine, your body will start to store fat. Second, low thyroine levels can also lead slow down your metabolism. And finally, hypotyhroid may also cause you to feel tired and sluggish, which can make it harder to exercise and lose weight.\nIf you think you may have hypothroid, talk to your doctor about getting tested. There are several different tests that can help diagnose this condition. Once you know for sure that you do have it, there are things you can do to help manage it and keep your health in check.\nHow does low T3 affect weight?\nLow T levels are associated with weight gains. Low T can affect your appetite, metabolism and energy levels. It can slow your metabolic rate, making it difficult to lose or maintain weight. Additionally, LowT can increase your risk of obesity and other health problems.\nLowT is also associated weight-related health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms or have been diagnosed with Low-T, speak to you doctor to see if treatment is right for you.\nCan low t3 cause hair loss?\nYes, hair can fall out due to low testosterone levels in men. Testosterone is the main male hormone and is essential for maintaining healthy hair growth. A lack of testosterone can result in thinning hair, baldness, or even hair falling out. While there isn\u2019t a cure for low-T hairloss, treatments are available that may help slow the process down or prevent it from happening altogether.\nDoes hypotyroid cause fatigue?\nThere is no one answer to this question as the symptoms of hypthyoid can vary from person to person. However", "The link between thyroid and weight\nCan thyroid problems cause weight\u00a0gain?\nWe all know that some causes of abnormal weight for a person can be connected to the under- and over-workings of the thyroid. The thyroid is considered by many as the \"command center\" of metabolism, but how does it really do that? Why does an over-working or under-working thyroid cause people to gain weight, while an \"average working\" thyroid prevents them from doing so? Keep reading to find out.\nWhat should a normal metabolism look like?\nIt is said that metabolism is the sum of all biochemical reactions. Basically, anabolic and catabolic reactions happen in every cell of our body. Let's divide anabolism and metabolism into different reactions within each of them:\nAnabolis\nIn anabolics our tissues (especially tissues where cells multiply a lot, like liver, skin, GI) make our cell compounds \"stronger\" and more \"durable\". In this way, the body will be able to resist changes in temperature, resist different kinds of infection (colds, inflammation). On top of that we want to use these molecules as a basis for new cell growth.\nWhile cations are processes that make the cell molecules more delicate and easy to degrade. Our bodies need to \"clean\" constantly these cell components that are older or broken. These components are either used in the different metabolic reactions throughout the cells to maintain them in a good condition, or will simply be degraded for excretion and elimination.\nAll of these processes take energy. Energy that you need by eating food to sustain these reactions.\nThe speed at which the metabolism\u00a0works determines the amount of fuel (energy) that the person needs to eat.\nSo, in cases of a too slow or too fast-working\u00a0thyroid, are you getting enough or to much energy?\nIn a\u00a0 case of hypothyrosis you have less T4 and T3 in your bloodstream. Thyroxine is converted to T _{3} \u00a0 (thyronine) only on the spot where it's needed the most. In case there is no excess of thyroxines in blood, you will have to compensate these by using other\u00a0energy sources. So, it is unlikely that a severe low\u00a0functioning thyroid contributes to\u00a0 weight increase. On the contrary, because of insufficient hormone levels, a low TSH can in some cases even cause\u00a0weight loss because\u00a0of an accelerated metabolic rate.\nBut in case your\u00a0 thyroid under-functioning is", "If so, what foods can help?\nDoes hypothyroidism affect blood sugar levels?", "The connection is more common than you might think\nHow to determine if your thyroid issues are causing weight issues\nWhile many factors determine weight loss or weight maintenance (such as diet, exercise, medical conditions or medications), some people are particularly prone to gaining weight. One of these conditions is hypothyroidism. Some people also become excessively tired when they don\u2019t eat regularly due to decreased metabolism, and some are more sedentary, further exacerbating the sluggishness and weight increase. Others gain weight due in part to hypometabolism, or low metabolism.\nWhat is the relationship between hypolhypothyron, the metabolism and excessive weight? When the thyroid is not working correctly, metabolic changes will occur that may lead to increased weight. Some of the effects include:\nLack of appetite. This is one of hypodipathy\u2019s most common characteristics. You don't feel hungry as often and don`t feel as full as you used to.\nLower basal metabolic rate. Your body burns fewer calories. As a result, you burn fewer kilocalories than usual and have fewer opportunities to reduce your waistline.\nSlow digestion. The slowed digestion also makes you feel full more quickly, which may prevent you from completely filling your stomach and preventing weight reduction.\nSlower fat burning. Even when you are physically active, your body uses stored fat more slowly. So fat cannot be converted into useful fuel as a source of energy. It is stored. While the hormone cortisol is partly responsible for this process, research has shown that hypopthyroid is also involved. Increased cortisol levels can cause increased fat storage and increased abdominal fat deposits. Additionally, cortisol can also increase appetite and lead you to consume more calories than your hypothroid system can efficiently use to produce energy.\nThe connection between low weight and low thyrotropin levels is difficult to understand. Because thyroid hormones can affect multiple systems, their metabolic effects on the body are not yet fully understood. These effects have the potential to disrupt many physiological processes. Fortunately, treatment of low typhoid is straightforward and effective. Treatment with synthetic hormones, as well as proper lifestyle changes, such as eating healthy and getting the right amount of exercise can get you back on track and help you reduce weight.\nRead More: 14 Surprising Facts about Hypothyrodism and Weight Gain\nFor more information on hypotropathy, see Thyroid Disease\nRead more: What causes hypothermia?\nThyroid Problems and Depression\nAlthough it is still a mystery as", "Does it affect you as dramatically in the spring when your weight typically dips after a winter of hibernation? If you\u2019re one of the thousands of Americans who suffered from hypothyroidism long-term without a diagnosis, you likely are carrying a few extra pounds in your trunk. It\u2019s not surprising: The sluggish metabolism that comes along with the disease creates the perfect set up for weight creep. That is, unless you do something about it\u2014starting now.\nAs you might suspect, a slow thyroid gland causes slower metabolic processes, and that spells out one thing: weight hang-ups. But here\u2019s how it works on your body, more specifically:\n* A slower metabolism leads to fewer calories burned.\n* With fewer daily calories being burned off, they are instead converted into fat storage.\nIf you have been diagnosed or suspect that you may have hypotyeroidism, don\u2019t despair. Dr. Eric Berg, DC, BCIA-CAI, shares his top five tips for busting low-thyroid weight and feeling lean, fit and active.\n1. Increase daily iodine intake\nThe mineral iodide is a primary nutrient for nourishing the thyroid, says Berg. If an individual is iodinedeficient, many times the body will take iodidefrom the organs, tissues and glands. In the case of hypodthyroid, the tissues most effected include the adrenals, thyroid and ovaries. With the exception of 10 people in all of America, every other person with lowthyoid is suffering from an iodindeficiency.\n\u201cI have not had a person come to my weight loss clinic in Washington D.C. who is hypthyrocid, with or without underactive thyroid hormone output, that did not need more iodiodine in their diet,\u201d Berg says.\nIncrease your daily intake of iodidine by:\n\u2013 Taking 100mcg of natural potassium iodidedaily, alongwith iodidanase (found in fruits and vegetables) and iodinated salt (preferably sea salt) to get at least 1,200 mcg daily\n\u2013 Eating a daily food source of fish or kelp, ifyou are not a strict vegan", "This is one of the hottest topics in the natural health community these days. I\u2019m going to delve into this a little deeper and talk about why our adrenals are involved in all of this. First off, the thyroid hormone T3 makes the transition in cells from resting to active. It tells your cells to burn energy. So, that\u2019s why a decrease in thyroid can make you sluggish and tired.\nHypothyroidism is the medical term for low functioning thyroid. There are several different types of it. And there\u2019s no way for your doctor to know what type if doesn\u2019t have the right tests. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t even do that!\nWhat the heck are the adrenal glands?\nSo, these are small glands that sit on your kidneys. They are critical to your survival and their function. Your body has the wonderful ability to make enough hormones if you don't have enough. If you didn't, you would die. Adrenal glands make the most important hormone in your body, cortisol. Without this hormone you will die.\nDo adrenal fatigue and low T have an interaction?\nThe adrenal system is an entirely different system from the T. The adrenal gland uses your thyroid hormones as building blocks for its products, including cortisol and aldosterone. When the adrenoals don;t get this feedback, it impairs their ability. Also, low adrenal hormone function impares your TSH response. As in, your pituitary doesn't communicate properly with your whole thyroid gland. This can cause low conversion of T4 to T1. Plus, if it's not functioning well, other chemical reactions in our body suffer.\nHow do I check my thyroid and adrenal function?\nYour doctor will not check your adrenal. You will have to check it yourself. We do offer an at-home adrenal test. Here.\nYou can get a comprehensive test that checks all levels of thyroid, as well as T and T, and they will send them to you at home to complete. Or you can check the free T test through the doctor. Because the cost is really low, its something you should definitely ask to do if this is something that you are worried about.

If you are taking 1,000 mg. of glipzide, you should be getting good control of your blood glucose. The metformin should help you to get better control. You should not take more than 3,500 mg per day. Your doctor should have told you that. Metformmin can cause low blood glucoses. This is why you need to check your sugars often. Also, if you have a low, eat something. Do not drink juice or soda. They will raise your sugar. Eat something with protein and fat. A peanut butter sandwich is good. Or a hard boiled egg.", "What about the other 2 medications? Do you know anyone who is cured on any of them?\nI have PCOS and insulin resistance due to a hormonal imbalance. Before I started metrformm, I used to have extremely low energy and weight loss was difficult. My blood sugar levels were 106-107 fasting and usually in the 118-124 range after a meal. By adding metf, my energy improved and I am now losing weight. I have lost 35 pounds in 6 months. However, there is a side effect called'metf face', I now have skin inflammation on the side of face/neck area. After my PCP saw that this face condition on my face, she said not enough time had passed and it may take 12 months to see if metfm will cure my problem by controlling my blood sugars. The PCO is there as a result of PC, so it is less likely that met will make it go away. It has been 18 months for me since I found the PCos was causing severe insulin insensitvity due in part to over-production of hormones and adrenal fatigue which was not being recognized by doctors. So that is why it took 3 months of met to get blood gluc levels down in range. Now it varies between 90 and 98.\nLast year when I tried to discontinue the met and was under my endocrinologist's orders to go into a weight control program, the blood glucose levels soared above 260 at the end of each day and the rest of the day levels varied between about 135-200 on food and at times of no food. When I increased back to 2000 mg met per day, a few weeks later I went to the lab for retest and levels had gone to low 100s and remained in that range for 1-2 months.\nYou have to find out if you have another condition such as insulin-resistant diabetes 11, etc. What does your gyn say?\nDo not try to ween yourself off the medication. If you take the med then you must use it and follow her advice.\nIf it were me, and this PC-OS has never been treated, you could be facing complications with each pregnancy.

That was the first of 4 oral meds that worked for a couple of years and they're all gone now. My doctor has told me to expect to go on 3 or 6 or more meds before we can control my BG with meds, if it ever can. A C-peptide test and pancreatic insulin production testing would be helpful. But, it's not covered. So I can't have that data.\nOne of my sons was told he didn't need meds but his numbers were 115/1700. We tried Metformim, Glipizide and another that escapes me. He took two before each mea and his pre and po were consistently the same.

The purpose of the test in an early stage is to find out if you are pre-diabetic or not. If there is a problem, we recommend that you follow a diet that balances the fat content and carbohydrate intake.\nIt is likely that, even though you do not feel it, you already have some symptoms of diabetes. One or more of these symptoms appear for a number of factors, one of which is the lack of vitamins. In any case, if your BMI exceeds 25, and the ratio of body fat is also high, it is better to go to any medical center, at least for blood tests.\nIf you don't have any complaints, then you can order lab tests, including a glucose tolerance test, blood glucose levels, or home glucometer to check glycemia daily. I'm afraid that it will cost some money, but as you know, health does not hurt so much.\nWe will try to help you get the necessary medical assistance, which will not be particularly expensive.\nThe main symptoms are thirst, frequent urination, an insatiable appetite that does no good. These signs are associated with the fact that the pancreas stops producing the hormone insulin, responsible for sugar removal from blood.\nDiabetes diagnosis also includes a physical examination, a study of medical history, family history.\nIn order to confirm the diagnosis of adult diabetes, HbA1c and two fasting plasma glucose tests are usually carried out. Fasting plasma glycemic levels exceeding 126 mg / dL (7mmol / l) are diagnostic for diabetes.\nThere is no simple blood test that detects diabetes in the body, since the process that disrupts the metabolism of glucose is complex enough. Laboratory diagnostic methods are used to detect and monitor diabetes:\nInsulin level. This test aims to monitor the development and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency means that there are not enough cells in our body that produce insulin - beta cells of pancreatic islets. After the failure of beta-cells, they are no longer able to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels within the normal range at all times. Instead of losing a few beta-cell groups in a row, total failure occurs for every islet, resulting in diabetes onset.

It is the major energy source for nearly all body cells. The most common sign of diabetes is increased blood sugar. Because the cells in a person with diabetes cannot use glucose properly, it cannot be moved out of the bloodstream. Instead, glucose builds up in your blood and can cause numerous problems throughout the rest of your body.\nThere are two forms of Diabetes mellitus: Type I, also called insulin dependent, occurs when the pancreas fails to produce insulin and has been present since childhood, usually.\nType II or non insulin-dependent, is far more common than Type 1. As we age, the ability to generate insulin often drops off. That doesn\u2019t mean that insulin isn\u2019t made. Rather, there is less efficiency in getting it to where it works best. This lessening of insulin production often leads to the development of high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.\nMost people don\u2019t find out that they have diabetes until they are over 40 years old. Many do not have any serious complications from diabetes if they get regular exercise, eat a wholesome diet and take their medication.\nTesting for diabetes and monitoring the results of tests can be done by your doctor and/or through the assistance of a nutritionist.\nThis test can, depending on results, require additional tests, such a fasting blood glucose or glucose tolerance test. A fasting glucose is simply a laboratory measurement of glucose levels on an empty stomach. For the 2 hour glucose test, however, a meal, consisting of precisely measured amounts of sugar is eaten. Then after 120 minutes, blood is taken from the patient and tested. All of this testing enables doctors to pinpoint the origin and treatment of diabetic illness.\nIf you suspect that you may have the disease, you should seek a qualified physician.", "Or do I test my blood? The only thing I can find is Diabetes. Thank you.\nI tested all 4 markers, which I assume if anything indicates a tendency towards developing diabetes.\n@Teresa, in the \"Your Results\" section you will find detailed results on all of your tests.", "The short answer is no. I don't know of any genetic test that can accurately determine your risk for developing diabetes. Your genetic history probably contributes to the likelihood you'll develop diabetes, but it is not the only factor that controls diabetes.\nThe majority of people who develop type 2 diabetes are not at all obese. You do not have to be overweight to develop either type of diabetes. Even small babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes may develop the disease when they become adults. However, a history of gestation diabetes is one risk factor (in a number of risk factors) for type-2. If you have a close relative with either of the two diseases you may be at greater risk of developing them. That's a genetic risk.\nOn your own, diabetes can not be determined with complete accuracy until symptoms develop or your doctor finds you in the midst of a blood sugars spike. Diabetes symptoms depend on the cause. Type-1 diabetes normally presents itself in children under age 14 and can result in severe symptoms, such as ketoacidosis which can lead to coma and death if not treated immediately. Ketones are released to burn fats and protein for energy during insulin deficiency.\nPeople with type two diabetes have the option of treating the condition with diet, exercise or both. When treatment involves more than diet and exercise, the patient often is referred to a dietician and physical trainer to establish a healthier way of living.\nMany people may not even know they have diabetes until their disease progresses to Type 1 and symptoms present themselves. The best way for a diabetic to manage their illness is to monitor their blood glucose levels daily, and to carefully monitor changes in their condition, or symptoms of illness. Many diabetics are able to live normal healthy productive lives through healthy dieting, proper diet management and close observation of blood sugar levels.

{"Question": "Does the bacteria determine the antibiotic?", "Free_form_answer": "Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial substance designed to target specific mechanisms or components that are unique to certain types of bacteria. Hence, the bacteria\u2019s species is a crucial factor in deciding on the right treatment for a bacterial infection.

The bacteria determines the antibiotics it is susceptible to, but the drugs determine what bacteria they kill. This is because the mechanism of action of the different antibiotics is different. For example, penicillin kills bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan, while tetracycline kills by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis. Therefore, the type of antibiotic determines which bacterial species it will kill.\nThe bacteria also determines what antibiotics they are susceptible too. Bacteria have different mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics. Some bacteria have a mutation in the gene that encodes for the target of an antibiotic, so the protein is not made or is made incorrectly. Other bacteria produce enzymes that inactivate the active form of antibiotics, or pump the antimicrobial out of their cells. These mechanisms are specific to each antibiotic. So, for example a bacteria that is resistant to penecillin will not be resistant t tretacyline.\nSo, in summary, both the bacterium and the antibacterial determine whether the bacterial will be killed by the anti-microbial.", "29/04/2017 The study of the evolution of antibiotic resistance is helping to discover new types of antibiotics.\nWhat do you do when you get a cold? Drink your lemon tea? Take your favourite lozenges? Stay in bed to recover? All this will help you to cure \u2013 or alleviate \u2013 the suffering caused by the infection of your nasal cavity by a type of viruses. Nevertheless, at a certain point, the cold symptoms will disappear, but there will be a few days, or perhaps even weeks, with a blocked nose. This is what happens because a viral infection gives place to a bacterial infection, and the latter does not react so efficiently to the treatment recommended by that friendly pharmacist next door.\nThe truth is that this can happen when the pathogen infection consists of only bacteria or only viruses; and when it is composed by both types simultaneously. But why is this so? The answer is quite simple: bacteria and viruses work in different ways and have different weaknesses that we exploit to combat them. Thus, for instance, viruses have their proteins covered by an icosahedral (twenty-sided) shape; if we manage to identify it, we can develop a medicine specifically directed against this feature or against certain points of this protein, in a treatment that will only be effective in the event of a virus infection. When it comes to bacteria, proteins are very different and more plentiful. An antibiotic kills some of its proteins but, as a whole, this does so in all types. However, since each bacterium has its own set of proteins, antibiotics are not effective on all of them; thus, they are more effective when they suffer the attack of other bacteria than in an attack against our own cells.\nThis is also why a doctor prescribes an antibiotic so you can get rid of sinusitis: viruses do not reproduce by themselves in these places, so they will not be destroyed by such treatment. If you want more information, perhaps you would be interested in this article: The difference between a bacterian and a virologist. It seems a very technical matter, doesn\u2019t it? However it has an enormous importance if you believe that these types can combine and change, therefore becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Such a change does exist. And it occurs even faster than we believe.\nInfectious disease transmission through the environment can take place in multiple ways. Aerosols, fomites (inanimate objects such as clothes, furniture, door handles, etc.), soil, water,", "If that bacteria is resistant does it mean that all antibiotics are useless? That is a common assumption but one that needs to be corrected. Antibiotics do not all do the same thing and some work even when bacteria are \u201cresistant\u201d. The problem of the resistant bacteria often relates to certain antibiotics. In the case of penicillins it often appears that the bacterium is no longer responding, but actually there is an organism present that is responding to a different substance, usually a penam.\nWhen the first antibiotics were discovered, the effect of these chemicals on bacteria was a surprise. The result was to kill the bacterial cells. When the cell was killed, it could be demonstrated that various substances, which had not been released could kill or inhibit other bacterial species, that were susceptible to these. Penicillin, in addition to the penams which are not active by themselves, produces substances called penisins. These have no effect on cells by itself but are active against a whole new range of bacteria, like other antibiotics have their own unique compounds, each with characteristics that can be used to describe a given species.\nThe basic point to remember is that there are many different types of antibiotics, all with differing properties. For instance chloramphenicol is bacteriostatic, or slows the growth of susceptible bacteria without destroying the cells and therefore allows natural defences to attack and kill these cells, whereas antibiotics like penicticines are bactericidal destroying susceptible bacterial targets. It is possible that by using a combination of antibacterial substances it may be possible to achieve a cure using substances for which the organisms are resistant.\nIn terms of practical application, for the layperson, there remains the problem that doctors and other authorities insist that any course of treatment, when antibiotics fail should only be given after a diagnosis has been made. However, I believe that no sensible person would risk going to their GP with a sore throat and say \u201cI think I got the tonsillitis from the cat\u201d or \u201cthat nasty piece of meat I had at the local take-away\u201d but that a sensible GP will insist on a full history before making a judgement.\nAlthough certain bacteria produce the toxins which damage our cells (hence the need for antibiotics) there may not be a sufficient quantity of toxins to cause illness. There must also be some means of administering these toxins into the body. All illnesses have an incubation period. This time may range from seconds to months in the latter case an infected mosquito may bite an entire family at", "That's the question being studied by a team of researchers at the Department of Infection Biology and the Dutch National Centre for Antimicrobial Development in the Netherlands.\nThe team, led by Prof. Martin G. Papazoglou at Radboud university medical centre, Nijmegen, set out in 2016\u20132017 to make their own antibiotic with the intention of having it tested in humans. They collaborated with bioinformatician Bart de Paepe at Ume\u00e5 University to analyse sequences of their microorganism.\nDe Pene's team examined over 1.2 million genomes available in GenBank, and selected bacterial genes that could be modified to disrupt the metabolic pathways by which pathogenic micro-organizims develop antibiotic resistance.\nTheir analysis revealed a wide range of genes, including six bacterial sequences that encode enzymes essential to the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. These can be manipulated in such a way as to prevent their cells from growing. The researchers have called these sequences \u201cbacteria-fuzers\u201d.\nThese antibiotics can also inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria that are resistant to common antibiotics.\nIn collaboration with AstraZeneca, the UK-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, they are planning to test three new antibacterial agents that can produce the desired effects at a lower dosage.\nIf successful, this has the potential to transform current antimicrobial research and development.", ": How bacteria evolve through selection in subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics\nResearch Field General medical surgery\nPrincipal Investigator #### KIMURA Yu \u00a0\u00a0The University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Medicine, Lecturer,\u00a0\u533b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u79d1,\u00a0Lecturer\u00a0(40312530)\nKeywords Antibiotic / Antibacterial activity / Resistant mutation / Sub-inhibitor concentration / Streptococcus faecalis / Cell death / Fenton reaction / \u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30d7\u30c8\u30b3\u30af\u30b9 / \u30a8\u30c1\u30c0\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30b7\u30f3 / \u30aa\u30ad\u30b2\u30ce\u30fc\u30eb / \u30a6\u30a7\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 / \u30ce\u30d0\u30e9\u30ad\u30b7\u30eb / \u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30e1\u30bf\u30f3 / \u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d1\u30b7\u30de\u30c1\u30f3\n Research Abstract When Streptomycin (S) was administered in an ordinary course in mice, the animals with Strepto - cocci faacalis in urine showed a decreasing concentration of S and appearance of strains resistant to S. In the in vitro experiments, S was added in various concentrations to fresh cultures of a sensitive strain of strept - occ i. In concentrations above or at the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ), there was almost no growth. At 3.2 times the MIC, 2 S-resistant types were selected as well as sensitive colony. One was in the same level with the parental strain and another, type 1 strain, was resistant against S up to 64 times its MIC. When 128 times MIC of G418 was used, we observed an increasing in S-resistance up as much as that of type I strain. These two S resistant strains were not cross-resistant against other antibiotics and sensitive to other 10 types of drugs. Type I showed an increased expression of outer membrane protein. As the cells of the type resistant strain grew poorly, this type may have a defect in normal metabolism.

That there is for example a type A drug, for gram negative bacteria, and a drug B for Gram positive.\nI asked this question on several fora, but got nowhere. Any answers would be appreciated.\na. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is very common and the situation is further complicated by mutations in the bacterial genome as well as incompatibility in cell permeability and so on. So you cannot say that an antibiotic will kill only gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria (at least the antibiotics are now categorized into narrow spectrum antibiotics and broad spectrum ones.)\nb. On the other hand, it depends on the nature of host bacteria as different bacteria carry different mechanisms for antibiotic resistance. For example, resistance due to alteration of target site, production of enzyme that inactivates antibiotic drugs, altered transport/mobilization or export of relevant antibiotic molecules to target sites, mutation in 16s rRNA and alterations in membrane permeation. All these may also affect the efficacy of antibiotics.\nYou can read this review to have more details.\n$\\begingroup$ That's all well and good.

The normal body temperature is about 98 degrees F, and when you're feverish you will feel warmer and more uncomfortable than usual.\nWhat does it happen that can make your body feel like this?

Breast pain and tenderness is very common at this moment but can feel very uncomfortable.\nWhen the nerves responsible for making the arm and leg muscles contract are stimulated, muscle contractions, as when cold, cause shaking.\nIn addition, your nerves are overactive to the touch because of the increased circulation in your breasts when they are feeding.\nIf you feel the need, massage your chest with warm compresses as an alternative. Cold, engored breasts can become very painful and your nipples may even crack open.\nIt is common for a mother to experience breast engorement during the first few days of breastfeeding.\nDuring this time, it is believed that the baby is not breastfeeding the full breast and you notice the nipple can be sucked in.\nNurse on that side of your baby to make the engoured breast softer.

I was wondering for how long can a breast stay engorgated after a period and if it can still cause a woman to feel really cold.\nThank you - you have very good questions. The answer might be different for each woman based on what exactly is happening. If you are having difficulty with breastfeeding, this is normal, but should lessen over time.\nIf you see an increase in the size of your left breast after that time, it means that the blood flow to that breast has increased and the left is engoragated. Some women are \"one sided\" in this respect. In normal breastfeeding situations, the body will begin to adjust and feed more from the engored breast, so the problem resolves itself as baby is feeding. With engorement due to \"improved\" blood supply, you may find yourself leaking from that side and needing to pump off some of the excess milk in a pump if the baby doesn't feed from it, because the skin on the breast could be sensitive and crack without the drainage.\nYou should contact your doctor for further advice regarding your issue, for example, if you notice a discharge from either nipple.\nThe good news is that all women \"get there\" and find the right way to feed their baby that works for both Mom and baby. Ask for help and support as you start your journey.

I have this feeling that every single time I get sick the last illness has somehow caused me to be susceptible to it.\nOr, in all honesty, I think I feel like this because everyone thinks I always feel better than this.\nYes, my body is probably just fighting it the same way it did the other illnesses. But my brain and ego can\u2019t handle the idea of someone coming over to my house and being too sick to function like the Super Mom\u00ae I try to portray myself as.\nThen there\u2019s my son that wants to spend every waking moment in my bed or on my lap. He says I cuddle him a lot. Which means he\u2019s doing his job well because I don\u2019t cuddles kids any more than I needed to. And he knows this. So he sits in front of me while I sit at my desk and tells me I need to hold him more. Then he tries to jump in on top of my keyboard or into my work bag.\nWhy does he get so sick so often?\nHis immune system is just young. Plus, there are things he comes in contact with that we don't, and so he's exposed to more viruses than we are. Kids also tend to spread their germs around. If one of them comes home with it first, they can infect everyone.\nMy immune is functioning fine. All of it is working pretty much the way its supposed to.\nThat\u2019s not the problem with my kids getting germy. They have siblings that share a room, spend time with people at school and other children outside of the home and do all the things that kids are supposed do.\nWell, we have a couple of things. One: I touch and kiss them every day. The fact that I do so much research on viruses and how they spread leads to me washing my hands a whole lot more now too. Second, when I am sick, or even just think that one is coming on, it all goes out the window.", "How can it be possible that everyone else seems well except me? And, how exactly do people catch the flu, then?\nIt was a very hard week for this family. Four of my seven people were down and out with colds and sore throats. Even when you are sick in a place this size, your nose never goes too far from a bed. (My littlest family member doesn\u2019t get sick often, but my older children rarely miss a winter with bad allergies and cold and flu season.)\nI had to keep my distance from them to try to stay healthy. I could catch their germs much better and probably even get a higher fever than they did because I didn\u2019t have a natural resistance to the bugs.\nMy body was in serious need of rest. In fact, I was so tired that I took a nap at about 2:30 in one afternoon while everyone was outside in their various activities.\nI slept for 3.3 hours when I woke up, my throat was very sore! I knew right away what was happening and I felt a bit of panic. Oh no, not here again.\nThis cold virus hit me hard! It knocked me down for two weeks in February.\nSo, back to a virus. It is one of the most irritating things to deal with as a parent of children who don\u2019t listen to your requests or follow your advice.\nViruses, unlike bacteria, are not germy. They don't cause infections or diseases. Most viruses do not cause disease in humans but simply live in and on our bodies\nAs a microbiologist on the farm, there are some things that are hard to control. For instance, when it comes to viruses, that\u2019s really one thing a farmer can\u2019t prevent.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that after my sickness went away, it was nearly impossible to get rid of all traces. The virus wasn\u2019t dead or alive \u2014 it just existed in nature. Every time someone sneezed, sneeze particles containing billions of these germin, virus particles, were expelled.\nVirus particles can be carried by wind or they are carried into food where we spread them throughout the food supply. Virus particles are everywhere! This really makes life stressful if I\u2019m a person on-the-go or if we are entertaining family and friends. How do I know that the surfaces I am using in my kitchen are free of virus particle contamination? What if my children were sick days ago but have recovered and are using", "So I had a pretty bad cold over the weekend, then I got hit with flu-like symptoms last night \u2013 a fever and chills.\u00a0 Today, I woke up feeling a little better, but there\u2019s still no telling when it will all be over.\u00a0\u00a0 I went to a couple of my favorite stores today looking for something to read.\u00a0\nI bought this new volume of poems by Richard Blanco, \u201cHow to Love a Country,\u201d and I\u2019ve only dipped into it, so it may be a while before I have more to say.\nOne of the most memorable things I read on Sunday was \u201cAn Immigrant\u2019s Story,\u201d an excerpt from the new biography of Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow. It\u2019s a powerful account of what immigration meant for him \u2013 and a strong reminder that immigration is so basic to America\u2019s story. (Hamilton\u2019s was the story I knew best, of course, because of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical. But I don\u2019t have any close family links with immigrants.)\nThat was a good one to come upon. Then I bought the latest volume in Jennifer Weiner\u2019s \u201cWho Do You Love?\u201d series. Last year\u2019s book was about two sisters; this year brings on two friends. They used to gossip about the men they dated and the celebrities who did shows at their suburban New Jersey deli. Now their talk is about their kids, and some of those old memories come up. One, who\u2019s Jewish, is having a hard time letting her kids have a Christmas tree. I guess I\u2019m going to see where her story goes, as I do with most of Weiner.\nThe biggest surprise of this shopping trip came when I looked in my bag and saw a book that I thought I\u2019d bought a month or so ago. Only when did I find it?\nSo let me just be honest: \u201cThe Loyal Son\u201d by Daniel Remein is not exactly the kind of book I like \u2013 an old-fashioned, heavily-researched biography. The author is an academic historian, writing a scholarly study. And it might seem to be about Aaron Burr, not Alexander.\nBut there were so many moments when the book shined. Burr\u2019s father, Aaron Senior, had been a respected lawyer, in what was still the British colony of New York. Junior attended Princeton, where he became a close friend of Hamilton\u2019s \u2013 who was so much older. Once Burr went into politics, his friendship was with the Federalists, Hamilton", "We had a flu shot last week, too.\nAs of today, it's a two-to-one ratio: I'm down; my significant other is up. I can't tell you how I feel, because I don't think a sentence exists in our language that can describe the combination of aching limbs, a burning chest, an irritated throat, and other assorted body parts.\nI'm waiting to fall asleep because that's the one part of the day when I'll feel OK. Unfortunately, my husband, who's home with me, is too sick himself to even help. We've been in bed all day, which isn't conducive to the 19,000 things we have to get done today.\nIf you're reading this while you have a spare moment like this, send me your best get better card.\nFor now, I think I'd better stop. Good luck, everyone. Hope you stay well.\nOh no! How horrible. And 24 hours until bed time. The only thing I know of is my parents put me to bed young....at 5. If you can get some rest, everything else will fall into place faster.", "This is ridiculous! I\u2019ve been here for three days and neither of my parents have so much as a sniffle.\nI know my father would say this is what a strong immune system does, or that he and my mother are both just plain healthy adults. I\u2019d believe him.\nAnd then, as if to prove a point (though I think it\u2019s an idiotic one), I hear the toilet flush upstairs and a minute or two later, I can hear my parent\u2019s bathroom door open and the sound of the shower being turned on. Ahh! Finally. It took long enough.\nNow, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going up there like a normal person, so I start tapping out a series of knocks against the kitchen table. When I first learned that \u201cknock code\u201d was a thing, it seemed like the greatest thing in history. No more stupid keys dangling around your neck or having to remember which one was on which side. You could just make up a knock code and nobody would ever figure out what it was.

I think mine is a small ulcer in my mouth, i dont know, it hurts badly, please any help?\nComments for Can herpis or herpes be mistaken for an ulcer?\nThanks for visiting. Herpes blisters can be quite difficult to miss in fact.\nHerpes can appear just about anywhere on, and even inside, your mouth - and can mimic a number of other conditions, such as ulcers (canker sores), cold soresses (fever blasters) and other oral issues, including burning sensations in the mouth.\nI would personally not take a 'wait & see' approach especially if you regularly have issues with outbreaks, simply because the herpes virus can become dormant until later in life when other stresses are applied to the body to trigger the outbreak. At that point you may not even suspect it is what it really is and it may be treated in ways that do not address the root causes of the problem, namely the actual herpes infection, which can lead to a more serious and chronic problem - one for which antiviral drugs may no longer work.\nYou can certainly look into the various oral treatments available for herpes and I would also encourage you to seek medical attention regarding this issue, especially as you are not getting any relief.\nWhen you have a diagnosis, you will be better informed as to what is really going on!\nI hope your problem gets taken care of sooner, rather than later.\nThere is some confusion about CANKER SORE and mouth ulceer.\nCANKERS SoRE ARE PAINFUL BUT HEAL WITH TIME. THEY GROW AND GO.\nMouth Ulcers are different. They are also painful but they do NOT grow; they disappear after healing. The important thing is that you should clean each outbreak with an antiseptic mouthwash because any ulcer is an entry point for many dangerous oral bacteria.\nIf you take proper care, most of these lesions will heal on their own. But if they recur frequently, try to find a dentist who can give a proper treatment.\nJust make sure to tell him that the cankers were there earlier but healed. Tell him also that they reappeared after your recent dental work or for some unknown reason.\nBut do clean them daily with ant-septic oral rinses.\nOne more thing you can do is to get some Vitamin B -complex", "They are very painful! I have gotten many cankers and some do hurt almost as much as these, but I could eat when I had one of those. My two new ones on front bottom left tooth, and one bottom right tooth are both big and painful so is making it hard for me to eat.

I dont think its an ulcers\nThere are so many different causes of a sore that I have to say it is impossible to \"guess\" what it might be.\nA doctor can tell you what is most likely by examining it under a microscope. In order to get a microscopic exam, though, you would need to put it aside so it could dry out and be \"scraped\", which you probably d not want to do because you are afraid you have a \"virus\".\nI need another opinion on this sore. As I mentioned, it hurts extremely deep, is painful, and it so red and almost purple that it look very bad. Its just not an ulcer in my opinion. It is also round and doesnt have raised edges like an mouth ulcer. My sore is deeper and hurts more, like it has gotten in the nerve somehow.\nIf you really want some information, then you must be willing to let someone take the time to give you an exam.\nHow was your sore diagnosed? Was it scraped by a doctor? Were tests ran? What were the results?\nIf it was just an \"anterior aphthous ulcer\" you should have been told that.\nThe best way to rule out a viral source is to have tests that can distinguish this, but that is not likely to happen if you don't get an examination from a qualified oral medicine or virology expert.\nNo. You just said \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an aphtha\" - there is absolutely no evidence that your \"sore\" is anything other than that. \"Don\u2019t\" and \"can\u2019t be certain\" are very different, please be precise.\nFor one you say its not like any mouth ulfers I ever seen. They dont have deep pain. Theirs is no way it can be a mouth ufer in every respect. Ive had them and yours seems like nothing like the ones I had that was sore but never a deep horrible pain and a pain that never let up. Those ones were like they were always there because when they wernt then the other sides would start as they didnt get the chance to heal up and move on.\nIts been about 2 days that its been really painful and the deeper parts have pain from nerve damage, which is a different type of pain than mouth sores.

Usually with herpes you'll end up having multiple soress and not just one.\nHerpes does not usually cause pain or itching on the lips, so cankersores could be the diagnosis.\nCANKER SORE is caused by bacterial infection.\nHERPES is an infection by virus.", "Are they transferable to each other, like herpes or herpes to someone else? Please advise. I do drink (wine only) and have smoked in the past in my life. Is it really wise to say no to anything else if you do have either or can a certain virus in your body not be transfer by something that seems so harmless as wine or just drinking.\nMost people with the herpes virus are unaware of it as one of the first symptoms is a single spot and then you are clear for a few months. When in contact with something you cannot see e.g. in a swimming pool, hot tub or toilet seat, you would not have the symptoms straight away. If you develop sores, it is probably not herpes. It may be a viral infection or thrush, but not likely to be herpes.\nCanker soars and other sore mouths are extremely common.

What is the normal blood?\nHow to measure the blood\nHow is blood measured? Blood pressure is measured by a device called a sphygmomanometer. The device consists of a cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm and a pressure gauge that measures the pressure in the cuff. To measure, the doctor or nurse wraps the device around your arm, pumps up the air in it, and then slowly releases the valve. As the gauge drops, you will hear a sound that indicates the systolic pressure (the pressure when the heart contracts). The systole is when your heart is contracting and pushing blood out of the body. When the sound stops, it indicates that the diastolic blood (when the ventricles relax and fill with blood) is reached. This is called the pulse pressure. It is important to note that blood is not measured in a single measurement, but rather in several measurements over time. Blood is a fluid that circulates throughout the entire body, so it is impossible to take a measurement of blood in one place. Instead, blood measurements are taken at different points in time, such as when you are sitting, standing, or lying down. These measurements can be used to determine your overall health and to monitor any changes in your health over a period of time.\nWhat is normal pressure?\nWhat are the different types of pressure and how do they affect our health? Normal pressure refers to the amount of force that a person can exert on an object. Normal pressures are measured using a scale called Pascal\u2019s law. Pascal's law states that for every unit of mass, there is an equal and opposite force. For example, if you weigh 100 pounds, then you can push a 10-pound object 1 foot away from you. If you push the object with a force of 50 pounds (50 x 2 = 200 pounds), then the force will be 20 pounds. In other words, normal pressures can range from 0 to 500 pounds per square inch (psi). Normal blood pressures range between 120/80 and 140/90 mmHg. High blood pressur\nWhat does it mean to have high blood pres\nHigh blood means that your body is under a lot of stress. Stress can come from many different sources, including work, family, relationships, finances, etc. Your body responds to stress by releasing hormones that cause your muscles to tense up and your breathing to become shallow.

I am tired of taking medicine for it. What can I do to prevent it?\nPost nasal drainage is a common problem. It is caused by a variety of factors. The most common cause is allergies. Allergies cause the nasal passages to swell and produce more mucas. This mucs is then drained into the throat. Other causes include sinusitis, colds, and infections. There are a number of things that can be done to help prevent this problem.\nFirst, it would be helpful to determine the cause of the problem so that it can properly be treated. If allergies are the culprit, then it may be necessary to take allergy medication. Antihistamines and decongestants are often used to treat allergies.\nIf sinus infections are causing the postnasal drainage, antibiotics may help. In addition, nasal sprays and saline rinses can help to clear the sinuses and reduce the amount of drainage.\nIn some cases, surgery may need to be performed to correct the underlying problem causing post-nasal drainage. For example, if the drainage occurs because of a deviated septum, a surgical procedure can correct this.\nThere are also a few things you can do at home to reduce postnatal drainage:\n1. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Dry air can irritate the mucous membranes and cause them to produce excess muck.\n2. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Water helps to thin out the mucks and makes it easier to drain.\n3. Avoid exposure to allergens and irritants. These can trigger an allergic reaction or cause inflammation, which can lead to postnal drainage\n4. Try over-the-counter de-congestant or antihisamine medications. They can provide relief from congestion and help reduce mucking.\n5. Practice good nasal hygiene by using a saline nasal spray or rinse regularly. Saline helps clear out mucky build-up and keeps the nose moist.\n6. Get enough sleep each night. Lack of sleep can weaken the immune system and make you more susceptible to infections, including those that cause postnose drainage", "Many people find themselves dealing with post-nasal drip, a runny nose, and cough that sometimes can be caused by something as simple as a cold. However, there are other common causes of postnasal drip. One is known as allergic rhinitis, which is quite common, especially with children. Here are some of the commonest symptoms of allergic or vasomotor rhinopathy.\nCommon symptoms: When you have postnose nasal drop, one of its common symptoms is the continuous run of your nose. This can manifest itself in three ways-the constant need to clear your throat or cough a lot, sneezing, or a constant itching sensation in your nasal passages. You will also discover that your sense of smell becomes duller, making breathing difficult.\nIn case you are suffering from allergic sinusitis, your doctor may want to run tests. Some doctors prefer the use of a nasal saline spray to flush the sinuses of mucus and to treat other symptoms like sneezy cough. The saline solution may need more than just a few weeks to relieve your symptoms. It might need repeated doses and may require a change in lifestyle habits. Sometimes, the doctor might prescribe antibiotics because there is some evidence that bacteria might also be causing the run in the nose.\nFrequently, allergies and post nose drip are triggered by environmental things such as pollen, dust, mold spores, foods, animal furs, wool, dyes, scents, household chemicals, latex, etc. If you live in a region where there\u2019s high pollen count, it is best to avoid exposing yourself to the allergen by wearing protective equipment like long-sleeved shirts, pants, long sleeves, gloves, masks, sunglasses, nose plunger and even surgical masks. Avoid eating certain foods like eggs, meat products, milk, wheat, eggs and more since they can cause allergic reactions.\nNasal sprays contain various ingredients which work to open the air passages by reducing the miasma or congestion. There are various sprayers available in pharmacies or drug stores. They can also come in handy as well. Simply fill the small bag with solution, insert the tip into the nostril, blow gently till you see the plug, then remove it and rinse. Keep repeating this method till your congestion clears out.\nFor some reason the most common symptom of many people with allergic post drip is coughing.

This becomes the breeding ground for infection and viral infections.\nHow does mouch accumulate in nose?\nOur nose has very delicate and porous membranes which allow tiny particles to enter into the tissues.\u00a0 The pores get blocked and mocos gets deposited there leading to an accumulation.\nMucus is fluid secreted by some internal organs or linings in our body. The mousal glands inside the nose produces secretions to protect and warm incoming air during inhalation. These secretons have anti-biotic and decongestant properties.\nWhat does Post nasal mucleos refer to?\nPostnasal drip occurs due to nasal\u00a0blockages which causes the secretory glands to go into overdrive to make mocus, thereby, blocking the nasal passages. Infection and inflammation of nasal lining causes mouses production.\nA sore throat, irritation or dryness, snoring and sinus allergies all can lead to irritation and congestion of mucosa. It is not the allergy as the problem but the symptoms which accompany the condition. Pulsatile nasal obstruction and\u00a0 postnasial drip are the typical signs of allergies.\nNosebleeds (epistaxis) are a major health concerns during any flu infections or upper respiratory problems.

Water, especially warm fluids, can help thin and flush out muci that sticks to the throat and back of the nose. Other soothing beverages that can be used include juice, hot tea or cider, or broth.\nUse nasal irrigation. Use a neti pot or a nasal saline spray to rinse out the sinus cavities and nose.\nEat foods high in anti-inflammatory properties. Eating foods with naturally occurring, inflammation-reducing properties (antioxidants) could help reduce post\u2013nasalandrop and the symptoms that follow. This includes foods containing vitamin C, garlic and red grapes.\nAvoid allergenic triggers. While some post\u2014inflammatory drip can\u2019t be avoided, others are triggered or exacerbated by certain allergies.\nStrengthen the immune system. Eat a diet that contains foods that strengthen the\u00a0immune\u00a0system.\nGet more sleep. Getting enough sleep can give the system a chance to restore itself. Those who get more are more likely to report having less post-inflamatory drip.\nManage sinusitis.

These include over -the- counter pain killers and over the counter ear plugs. People who have had multiple ear surgeries or damage to the outer ear may need additional treatment to prevent further damage. However, it is possible to do other things to help prevent damage and the recurrence of infection.Emergency medical attention is needed if a serious infection occurs and immediate medical care is not available.\nAn ear examination is usually sufficient", "The most common cause of otits externis ear drops and antibiotics. If the otitisaffects just one ear, the symptoms are likely to include severe ear pain. However, you should check your doctor\u2019s advice before buying drops. Also Know, can. You can use home remedies, including apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide, to treat otosclerosis. Your hearing will return to normal in most cases; however, complications can result. This condition is most often diagnosed in children between six months and three years old.\nThis is the most well-referred-to source. A large percentage of adult cases are in adolescents and young adults, and otic infections are usually caused by bacteria growing in the middle ear space. What causes swimmers ear in adults? In addition, it will be less painful than what it was when you first had it. Many cases of swimmer\u2019s ear may be caused or worsened by the following circumstances: Use an earplug, especially in loud, noisy places, such as shooting ranges, rock concerts or other similar environments.

There are also many medications in which the pain and heat have been relieved; in this case, a doctor should see the person in question as soon as possible.\nThe best treatment is often surgical, but surgery is also possible in many cases, even when there is an injury to the eardrum. The ear drum is generally only visible via otoscope during the course of an evaluation (no stethoscope). The outer ear is more vulnerable to getting sick because it is filled with water rather than air. It is not necessarily a serious problem for you, however it may cause many problems such in your ear. In many countries, doctors and otorhinolaryngologists are consulted with the ear as well as hearing problems as a primary diagnosis.\nCan otitus externus be treated at home? What is otites externas? Otites media is a condition that affects both the inner and middle ears due to bacteria, viruses or allergies. Ear infections occur for many reasons, ranging from bacterial infections, bacterial ototoxins, infections or trauma.

Swimmer\u2019s ears may have several causes, though the exact cause is unknown, in some", "Otovist. Otitis extern is an inflammation of the outer ear. Some cases involve ear canal skin cell damage resulting in cell debris that obstructs the auditory tube or the ear drum. There are several different forms: otic herpes, viral otomy. Viral otosis is a disease that develops due to chronic inflammation; otogenic otomaemia \u2014 an ear inflammation that spreads to other parts of your body \u2014 otomysitis \u2014 a painful, swollen ear that results from ear injury or surgery.

The mycosis is not caused directly but by an infection caused myosine. This condition occurs because mycine contains a virus that attacks the surface of an infected object, causing the patient to cough.\nAs a result, mycoitisic symptoms can become worse, making it difficult to determine what you have. If you suffer from chlamydia, you may find that you don\u2019t have any of these symptoms when you are pregnant. You should see a doctor to find out if antibiotics are a cause of this condition. Mycosine, though, is actually a fungal infection. However, it is very similar to a vaginal infection that is related to human papilloma virus (HPV). The fungus grows very rapidly in women\u2019s genital area and can cause discomfort. As a rule, this type of infection occurs with little or no symptoms. Women with chlamydia often have vaginal discharge, burning, and vaginal pain. To diagnose mycotomy in females, your doctor may run a urine test, as chamydinosis can look like genital herpes. Your doctor can recommend an effective treatment, if you suspect you might have mycocitomy.\nHow long does it take to cure otitus externus? Some doctors say as little as four days; others call it six or more. How long it takes for otosclerosis to clear depends on the type, location, time of year, how quickly the blood flows and other factors.

HR can be measured by a heart monitor or by taking your pulse. The pulse is measured at the wrist or neck. It is a measure of the amount of blood that is pumped out of your left ventricle with each beat. This is called the stroke volume. Your heart is pumping blood to your body. When you exercise, your stroke volumes increase. As you get older, the volume of each stroke decreases. You can measure your HR by using a stethoscope or a pulse oximeter. A pulse Oximeter is an instrument that measures the oxygen level in your blood. If you have a high HR, you may have an increased risk of heart disease. Heart disease is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances. Cholesterol is found in foods such as eggs, meat, dairy products, butter, margarine, shortening, lard, coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil. These foods are high in saturated fats. Saturated fats are the main cause of high cholesterol levels. High cholesterol is associated with an increase in heart attacks and strokes. There are two types of HR: systolic and diastolic. Diastole is when the heart relaxes between beats. During diasto, blood flows into the ventricles. In systole, when your ventricular muscles contract, they push blood out into your arteries.\nWhat is heart-rate variability?\nHeart rate variability (HRV) is defined as the variation in time between heartbeats. For example, if your resting heart beat is 60 beats/minute, then your average heart-beat interval is about 1.5 seconds. However, during exercise or stress, this interval can increase to 2.0 seconds or more. An increase of 0.1 second in HR interval indicates a decrease in blood pressure. Blood pressure is determined by how much blood is flowing through your veins. Veins carry blood from your lungs to the rest of you body.\nHR is usually measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG measures electrical activity in muscles and nerves. EKGs are used to diagnose heart problems such, as arrhythmias, heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease and many other conditions. Electrocardio is also used in sports medicine to monitor athletes\u2019 performance.

Collins February 22, 2022\nWhat is heart-rate variability?\nHigh HRVs may indicate improved fitness\nLower HRvs might indicate higher stress levels\nHow HR vs and physical fitness are connected\nThe role of HRv and heart health\nFor many people, a primary focus of their fitness regimen is their resting heart rhythm.\nBut what many fitness enthusiasts might not realize is that their heart beats, like their breath, are never constant. In fact, the beats in resting hearts are in a constant cycle, called heart rat variability, or HR versus itself.\nThe range and rhythm of heartbeats help people understand their overall heart and mind health, especially after physical activity or stress. HR var is an indicator of a person\u2019s fitness level and is considered an important factor when monitoring cardiovascular health.\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting a better reading about your heart\u2019s health and overall fitness levels, this could be a great place for beginners.\nHR V stands for heart beat variability that refers to the variation between beat beats or heart rhythms. Every person has a unique heart pattern that includes two different patterns of beats per minute, sometimes called the slow wave. This type of variation in heart tones means that every heart is different and has its unique rhythm and pulse.\nWhat are heart rates vs. during sleep?\nHR vs during the resting and sleeping phases are similar to heart sounds in other states of the mind, but the variations are small and less noticeable.\nHeart-rate var varies for each person depending on their sex, gender, and age. For example, women have a higher pulse rate variance than men usually have because they tend to get more rest and can have lower pulse rates.\nHow do you measure your?\nThe best way to measure a resting or active HR V is a continuous recording of your actual heart waves, also known as electrocardiograms, which are considered more accurate than measuring heart tone alone.\nA heart electrogram records the electrical activity of each heart when the heart muscles contract and rest, to determine the length of time between beats. These devices that measure HR Var are called electroencephalographs.\nYou\u2019ll also need to monitor your breathing rate while taking the recording to make a more detailed report of what\u2019s going on.\nWhy can monitoring be useful?\nThere are several ways that this information could help athletes understand and improve their performance.\nOne of them is measuring the relationship between physical and mental preparation for specific kinds of exercise. Sometimes people have trouble telling whether", "- HeartMath Institute\nFor those who are new to heart rhythm technologies such as Heart Math\u2019s EmWave2\u00ae, iawat-1, HRVs, and other biofeedback measuring devices, the idea of heart-rate variability (HRV) or heart rhythms may be confusing. What is the difference between heart- rate and heart-rhythm?\nHeart rate is defined as the number of beats your heart makes in a period of time. This can be measured directly from two sensors on your chest when you visit your doctor and a machine calculates your pulse. Most heart monitors that you wear, which measure heart activity and pulse rate, read heart-beat per minute. For example, your resting heart-pulse rate can measure 68 beats per hour. Thus your average heart beats 1000 times an hour.\nThe difference from the heart beat and the pulse (heart rate) is that the two are not precisely the same. Pulse (or heart -rate) measures how fast the blood is passing through your body, while the heartbeat is a contraction of the cardiac muscle.\nHeart-rate monitoring devices (such as some sport watches used in exercise) use pulse detection to track heart rates. By simply putting your finger on a sensor, it is able to detect pulse from your bloodstream.\nUnlike heart and muscle contractions, pulse does not occur regularly but pulses based on the rhythmic fluctuations of blood pressure during one single cardiac cycle. The speed in this beat of each person is unique and specific for the duration of your life. If there are any changes to your heartbeat, they can sometimes show up in your blood-pressure pulse and vice versa. HR Variability represents the changes between these fluctuations.\nAs mentioned above, heart variability is measured in the variations in heartbeats that determine the degree of changes in between systolic (contraction of ventricles) and diastolic events (relaxation). These can also be found in other parts of a single heartbeat called R-R inter-beats (measured in seconds). This is what one can see in HRMs (Hear Rate Monitors) if they are set up to display the signal from blood flow in ECG (Eletrocardiograph).\nHR variability can differ significantly depending on heart disease status (i.e. a healthy heart vs. congenital heart-disease), but is generally seen. It is also used as barometers for various factors, such. Stress, blood sugar levels, alcohol intake, drugs, anxiety depression, etc., are a", "Heart rate is your heart's rate per minute while heart variability is the measurement of how much your heartbeat changes or varies within a period of time i.e. during one minute. Therefore, HRM devices, including smartwatches, measure heart rates while HRVs calculate heartbeat variability.\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of the variability present in your body's cardiac signals. Your heart should not be beating at the same steady rate. That would be a sign of something serious being wrong. Heartbeat variability comes as a result of various factors affecting your health, emotions, fitness level, etc.\nA change from this usual pattern means the body is telling you it needs a change or adjustment. So, if something is wrong with your HR, be it too low or too high (or other unhealthy patterns), it can be due to a lifestyle, health or fitness problem you need to address. You can also get a low HR in relation to physical exercise. We get too used to the lower HR level post-workout and our bodies can't keep up with the sudden raise of activity.\nIf you track HR through a reliable wearables device or tracker, you will be able to see where you're lacking during your training sessions and use that information to adjust your workout. Or you may even consider changing or supplementing your fitness routine with yoga classes, meditating, or mindfulness practices; activities known to increase HR. This will help your brain release more dopamine and endorphins and improve your overall health.\nThe benefits of measuring heart variatilies\nUnderstanding your physiological responses, such as HR or HR variability can help you make more appropriate adjustments as you plan and carry out each training session. In order to make sure the results of these measurements are correct, it's very important to choose a highly-accurate device. For now, there's really no perfect device that can track and measure HR and HR variabilities in the best way. It's because current fitness watches and trackers can give you only an approximate result, and that usually depends on the size of your smartphone. Some of them also lack precise algorithms that are used for measuring HR.\nSo, whether you wish to keep an eye on your sleep, workout, daily steps, quality in daily performance or any other aspects of health and wellness, we advice you to go with a smartwatch with HR recording features that is more precise and accurate. And we've already done all the research and compiled the top picks into a list.\nFitbit Charge", "Does HRM take into consideration my resting heart beat?\nHRV is measured as the variability of the heartbeats between each other, not the beats per minute.\nTypically, HR, is counted from the R-wave (as depicted on your HR strap) using HR monitor.\nHR monitors are typically quite bad at measuring HR or R-R beat intervals below 0.2s (200ms). The reason for this is that the signal can vary considerably between when the electrodes are applied to the body between the chest and arm muscles contracting. The sensor is also quite large and tends to be relatively insensitive to rapid beat changes, although the sensitivity is improved considerably with better electrodes, straps and HR belts. If you measure the electrical activity of your heart by using some kind of direct contact measurement and record this activity with an EKG, there is a huge difference in the measured data. We have compared these with the HR straps, and when measuring at rest, they can be nearly 30 bpm different, when they have the same calibration. For our research purposes, we use the Mio strap during activities but don\u2019t trust it for low HR when at resting and therefore use electrodes and ECG for measuring it.\nWhat type of HR signal would you recommend for HR variability studies?\nWe don't have a recommendation, because there are a multitude or methods available. However, here are some suggestions. Use either the impedance lead (MIO type strap), or at least a three lead system with a single 10/20 standardized ECF lead and two auxiliary electrodes at the wrist. This is called a Lead I signal and is typically the most used for stress electrocardiographic tests. Another standard is the Lead II signal that uses a 3rd electrode on the lower left torso; this may be the best one for research. Try to find a signal with minimal electrical noise (EMG or muscle noise), and also try to use as short a cable as possible to avoid interference (which occurs if the cable can pick up a certain frequency). Be aware that your sampling rate (frequency of how often you record the 1 millisecond signal) should be at or above 50 samples per second; below that, you will miss a significant amount of data.\nIs the QRS complex important for analysis?\nYes, it is. In principle there should always be, but for some reasons, the software sometimes fails to detect the EGC signal.

It is an injectable medication, and it works by suppressing appetite and increasing feelings of fullness. Ozepmic is also a weight-loss medication but it is not an appetite suppressant. Instead, it helps to regulate blood sugar levels and can be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\nWhat is the difference between Saxena and Ozempi? The main difference is that Saxend is only approved for use in adults, while Ozemi is approved to be given to children as young as 12 years old. Saxen is given as an injection under the skin once a day, whereas Ozemic is taken orally once daily.\nIs Saxendo the same as Ozend? No, Saxondo is different than Ozendo. They are both weight management medications, but they work in different ways. Oxendo is more of a stimulant, which can help to suppress appetite. On the other hand, saxendo works more like a hormone, helping to increase metabolism and decrease appetite.\nHow long does it take for Saxando to work? It can take up to 4 weeks for saxando (liraglutide) to start working. However, some people may see results sooner.\nDoes Saxeno Work For Weight Loss?\nSaxendo (Liraplutamide) is FDA approved as a treatment for obesity in people who are overweight or obese. The drug works to reduce appetite by blocking the action of the hormone ghrelin, a peptide hormone that stimulates appetite in the brain. In clinical trials, people taking Saxedo lost an average of 5% of their body weight over 56 weeks, compared to an 1% weight gain in those taking a placebo.\nSaxedo is available as both an oral tablet and an intravenous injection. Side effects of Saxedo include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight increase, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, muscle pain, joint pain and back pain.\nThe recommended dose of Saxed is 0.6 mg once per day for adults and 3 mg twice per week for children 6 years of age and older. Saxe is generally well tolerated but may cause some side effects such as nausea and vomiting. If you experience any severe side effect while taking Sxedo, please contact your doctor immediately.\nCan Saxo Help With Weight Gain?\nThere is no", "Both drugs contain a molecule called semaglutide. This molecule is a GLP-1 analogue. GLPs or GLUCAGON \u2013 LIKE PEPTIDE is made in the gut and in many parts of the brain. Its purpose was to regulate blood sugar regulation in an acute situation, but it can also be used to treat obesity.\nBoth medications, OzEmpic and Saxenda, have approval for weight loss treatment. While OzEMPIC is also a medication to help control blood glucose, Saxanda is approved only for adults with obesity or for people who are overweight because of weight related medical conditions.\nSaxenda differs from Empic due to the dosage and dosage frequency, as well as weight, a patient may qualify for Saxende and how often to administer both semiglutides.\nSemgutides, the active drug in both Saxema and Ozempe, work by binding to cells in pancreatic cells that sense the energy, glucose levels, in our bloodstream and send out messages to notify our body to use energy in a more effective way or to stop storing excess energy.\u00a0\nThey both also work to suppress appetite by sending messages between the cells of our bloodbrain and gut that make us feel full without food.\nHow long to take Saxendar or Empico\nBoth semglatides are taken weekly but only after a medical evaluation, and you may require a titration period. Because the frequency of these medications is weekly, they are easy to remember and incorporate into your weekly routine for an already busy schedule.\nYou may, however, find yourself more frequently to eat with a higher frequency until you reach your maintenance dose, approximately seven days to five months.\nOne way to think of this is to find your new habit while not having to constantly worry about missing a dose or overdosing (though overdoses are possible and we\u2019ll get to that). Your body is going to acclimate to more frequent eating, so we do not want to miss your chance to stay hungry and stay full but, at the same time, stay within the recommended dose guidelines.\nAlso, how to store semiclutidies\u00a0\nIf you are prescribed either Saxada or Enpicic, it is important to keep it at a low temperature of 68 F or less, to avoid exposure to extreme heat or sunlight. In addition, avoid keeping them in moist or damp places and take advantage of airtight containers to prevent contamination. Keep any medications out of reach of any children under age 5 for safety", "Saxenda (liraglutide) has not been studied in people with Type 1 diabetes, and it cannot be used to treat type 2 diabetes in children who are under the age of 12. Liragen tablets are not interchangeable with Saxen tablets. They have different ways of working in the body.\nIs Saxena similar to Ozem?\nSummary: Saxend (a GLP-1 type) and Osempic (SGLT2 type-II D) are both very efficacious drugs for treating diabetes. Saxendar works on reducing appetite and delaying digestion, while Osem (or Osen) works by increasing insulin production and using available glucose in more effective ways.\nHow do Ozemed and Saxand compare?\nSaxena is a drug for diabetes that is injected in subcutaneous fat for long-term weight loss maintenance, to decrease blood sugar levels and improve hemoglobin A1c (HbA 01c) levels in adults with diabetes (12 years or older), BMI 27 or greater.\nCan Saxened and Ozemand be taken together?\nConclusions: Although both drugs are relatively effective at losing weight and reducing body fat, Saxendra is generally considered to be more potent in stimulating satiety compared to Ozeand, especially when given in combination with diet for weight reduction, with a greater average percentage loss in body weight.\nWhat is Saxenden?\nWhat Are Ozened?\nOsemd is used primarily to improve blood glucose control by reducing blood sugars. This medicine may be combined with insulin in type -2 diabetics or other blood-glucose-lowering medications. OSEMD controls the amount of sugar produced by the liver and promotes its uptake in muscle and fat.\nDoes Saxenen help with weight?\nThe weight-loss effect of Saxan (an amylin analogue) seems to remain stable during a year of follow-up treatment, although there continues to appear to a significant impact on body mass index.\nWhich drug should I use for type II diabetes?\nMetformin and sulfonylureas remain standard-of-care (SOC) drugs against which newer antidiabetes (anti-diabetic) treatments are assessed. Other commonly prescribed oral agents include: Glucagon-like peptide- (GLP-) 14 analogues (e.g., exenatide and liragetide)\nWhat are the side effects of Ozam?\nCommon side-effects of osem tablets include:\nHow does Saxaned work for children?\nHow Saxended Works", "Saxenda is used together with a reduced calorie diet and exercise to treat obesity in adults. Saxena is a weight loss drug that uses hormone levels to make you feel full. It can also cause weight gain, headache and diarrhea.\nIs Saxent different than Osem?\nSaxenda \u00ae is not used to help curb your appetite or lose weight. Ozenc is now used in combination with dieting and / or increasing physical activity, not to curb appetite for treating people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased body mass index (BMI).\nIs the Saxenta the same as Semaglutide?\nThe Saxend drug name is different, but the mechanism of action is the biological equivalent to the treatment. Semeglutides are drugs that act on the GLP-1 receptor, a hormone that plays a role in appetite. \u201cThe more GLT-2 there is, the more full (full).\u201d\nHow many times a day should you take saxent?\nTake Saxanda once a week, at any time of the day. Take your Saxen once the next day at the end of your previous dose. Your Saxand dose should be taken once at about the time you usually skip the last one. If you skip a dose, take it the following day.\nHow do I take my first dose of saxend?\nYour saxen doctor should give you the first injection when you decide to take the drug or after your instructions on taking your dose to start taking it. You can take your first Saxeda in the thigh, upper arm, abdomen or hip. There will be an insertion mark that should not be reused because it can increase pain when using Saxando.\nWhat happens if you overdose on Saxendo?\nSerious overdose of Saxande may occur, such as symptoms involving the heart or blood vessels. Overdose has been reported in post-marketing experience.\nWhere should saxendo be injected?\nDo not inject into the veins, muscles or fingers. Inject Saxonde the outer part of each arm or thigh. Be careful to avoid injecting into blood patches, scars, or damaged skin. Rotate injection sites to prevent nerve damage.\nCan Saxondo cause hair loss?\nHair loss has occurred with Saxende. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist if your hair begins to thin or other serious side effects appear.\nWhen should I stop taking Ozendim?\nYou will soon be able to return to pre-dinner doses. Do not stop using Ozendo without first talking to a health care provider or diabetes", "We can help with your Saxenda Prescription\nSaxenda is a prescription medication used to treat adults with weight-related medical issues. It is an injectable medication that helps people lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by increasing satiety feelings and decreasing appetite.\nTo avoid a potential safety risk, doctors recommend that individuals who are at high risk of cancer or who have had cancer in the past should not take Saxena. Saxene also has a number of drug interactions, side effects, and other possible complications. As a result, people should talk with their doctor or other medical professionals before starting to use Saxendal.\nHow to Get your saxena (semaglutide) 2mg Prescription?\nGetting a Saxendo prescription on the web is easier than going to your local drugstore. First, speak with a doctor to decide if Saxando is the right option for you. They can give you a virtual exam and tell you about any side benefits. Ask them any questions you may have, such as how to inject saxendo, if you don\u2019t know.\nThen, the physician will write a recommendation for the dosage and length of time that you will use the treatment. After your order is approved, you can finish at the pharmacy at a discounted price and have it shipped to any address you want.\nSAXENDA (Semaglitude) Side Effects\nSome people have allergic reactions to Saxenad or its ingredients. Signs of allergy include difficulty breathing, skin rash, hives, itchy skin that turns red, swelling in your mouth or throat, or wheezing or coughing.\nYou may also have blood sugar issues when using Saxada. Symptoms include increased thirst, blurry or double vision, drowsiness, feeling very hungry, confusion, passing out, increased heart rate, dry mouth, sweet or fruity breath odour, shaking, flushing, stomach pain, vomiting, irritability, flushed skin, sweating, trouble breathing (especially when lying down), dizziness, weak pulse.\nSigns include trouble sleeping, hot flashes, constipation, weakness, back pain or joint pain.\nPossible side effect issues include anxiety, diarrhoea, abdominal pain (stomach pain).\nOther possible side-effect issues are nausea, bloating, headache, cold symptoms, hair loss.\nOther potential side-effects are decreased appetite, acne, runny nose.\nIf you notice any of these or any other side affects, contact your healthcare provider.", "There are several ways to treat diabetes. Some are aimed at reducing blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetics and some can treat severe symptoms. How are these difference? In a sentence, Saxenda is a medication used to prevent the onset of diabetes and help you to lose weight after the diagnosis of obesity. It is part of a class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. Oz empic, on the other hand, is an effective injectible drug that is typically used for type two diabtes that has a problem with weight loss. Its mechanism is unique as it works at the pancreatic level to improve glycemia and insulin levels.\nAre you asking where is Ozempiq and Saxena made? Oz empic is produced by Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company. The company\u2019s name refers to the fact that it manufactures the drug and it has its headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. What is this product?\nWhat is Saxeda? Like Ozmepic, Saxend is sold under different trade names and by different companies. Sax eda and its variations under a different brand are available in the United States and several countries. Unlike Oz edic which are injected intravenously through a needle, these products are administered by nasal spray.\nHow does Sax era work? It acts as a neurotransmitter which works by making a protein that stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas. When insulin is released, the body cells take up glucose which is the main source of energy. With less glucose available for fuel, weight gain occurs, especially if the individual does not have an adequate diet or exercise habits. This insulin resistance causes a condition known as diabetic diabetes which causes various symptoms including increased thirst, dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision, nausea, and increased urination. There is also an increase in blood pressure and lipids in diabetic patients with higher levels of triglycerides and cholesterol.\nWhy are Oz enic and Sapientic being sold? Why are people taking these supplements? Many people take these medications in order to help them stay healthy or even to try to reverse or prevent diabetes in their loved ones.

The virus that causes the flu can lead to this kind of illness, but a wide variety of viruses can induce diarrhea.\nThe common cold, or \"acute respiratory tract infection,\" is so common that some 20 percent of Americans have a case each and every year. It is typically caused by one of hundreds of different types of virus, although some types can also be spread through bacteria. Some cases of the common-cold become very severe, leading to pneumonia. Most cases are treated at home, for most people are able to fight the cold with rest.\nFlu, on the other hand, is caused exclusively by a virus. Viruses are even smaller than bacteria, so they have an easier time passing between people. You usually contract the seasonal flu if one person sneezes on another. Flu symptoms can vary, the most common include: sudden onset fever, chills, weakness, an overall feeling of discomfort, headaches, muscle aches and pains, a sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, sinus pressure, runny nose etc.\nIt is important to keep yourself warm (since this is a fever) and drink enough liquids (water, juice etc) since your immune system and body in general will have to work a lot more than usual and thus the hydration will be important for you to recover faster.", "?\nI\u2019m not sick.

Also what kind of pain...stomach, head, muscle...? Thanks.\nI had the flu three weeks ago, felt bad for two days, and then was feeling ok. Only I slept for probably 20 hours a day. I think it was different with flu vaccines, I took myself off my medication for my epilepsy and went natural, not sure how I'd feel this year as I'll be taking my meds again. But I might get it this time too as everyone has been sick.\nIt all depends on the strain of virus (and you) as to how bad it is and how long. The virus can vary but seems to cause a typical flu that can last up to five days.\nWith all the people getting sick now, the peak of this epidemic should be right around the corner!\nMy brother has had flu from beginning to end now for nearly 3 weeks. It takes it's time.\nAs for what it feels like....you feel like crap. Fatigued. Sore. Generally miserable for a few days. Flu is worse than a cold though because it hits you hard and usually you feel bad longer than you'd expect. Like you've just taken a 10 kilometer hike with 1 kilo of bricks on your back and have run out of breath and need half-a-day at least to rest.\nThe stomach thing is not usually part of the normal flu. That is usually a separate thing called \"gastro-enteritis\". It generally occurs with a fever as well and is another \"bug\" that's different to flu.\nOne thing to remember is that there are lots of types of influenza.

However, there are some things you may need to take care of before you kick off your exercise and diet.\nIn the past, obesity had been linked to diabetes, but researchers, lately, have established a strong link between Saxena and cancer. This has been confirmed by a new study.\nIt is not, however, known whether this association is causal or not. But the results of the study make Saxendal important subject of research because of its effects \u2013 both good and bad.\nSaxenda and Weight Loss\nThe result of a Saxendas \u2013 based weight loss study conducted by Dr. Maria Lind a few years ago showed significant weight reduction in all participants. The study participants were men and women in their 30s and 40s whose BMI ranged from 26 to 39. Each of them was given a low-calorie diet and Saxinda. At the end of 3, 4, or 5 months, participants showed a significant loss of weight.\nThere is absolutely no doubt that Saxenas is going to be the number one drug for weight management in the future. People of different weight who participated in this study experienced various benefits and lost a different quantity of pounds.\nAccording to Dr Maria Linds and the primary author of Saxindas study, the outcome of this research study had a very positive impact on the participants.\nShe also explained that people who had taken Saxina were more likely to lose around 13 pounds or even 14 pounds over a period of three months. And for participants who took Saxinas \u2013based weight control treatment for five months experienced a weight-loss of about 17 to20 pounds per period.\nLinda also added that during the process of losing weight, Saxinal has no side effect, except that it caused an increase in heart rate and sometimes sweating during a workout. In contrast, those who were under Saxenal medication did not experience these side effects. They simply experience the benefits of reducing weight in a healthy manner. It is in spite of being on a diet of low calories.\nAs explained by Linda in one of her publications, people often struggle and", "That will depend on if you had any side effects with it.\nDoes anyone on this blog have any stories or experiences they want to share?", "Hello, you would start at 0.6mg daily for one week.

The main focus of Saxeda is to improve insulin sensitivity \u2013 it has been shown to be more effective than weight-loss drugs in decreasing triglycerides in obese adults.\nFurthermore, Saxed\u2019s effects aren\u2019t limited to belly or abdominal fat but are also seen in other areas of your stomach, including your waist. You won\u2019t gain fat if you eat too much, but you could lose it if your weight is not too high.\nWhat is the most successful weightloss medication?\nThe study found that there were 13 prescription medications approved to treat obesity. However, six were approved for use by all people, while only three were recommended for certain groups, like adults who weigh more than 125 pounds.\nThe six approved medications include: a combination of liraprotin, metformin and lorcaserin (Bayer); lomustine and rosiglitazone (GlaxoSmithKline); an analogue of vareniclin; and a form of metoprolol.\nHow often should I take Saxenna?\nIf you are starting treatment on a new dose, it should take anywhere from two to six weeks.

However, it can also be synthesized or made in a synthetic form and sold as a drug. The main reason why Melatonia is so popular is to promote sleep.\u00a0\nIn addition to promoting sleep in humans, melatination may also play an important role in enhancing mood and memory. Another function of melton is that it helps to regulate the timing of the sleep cycle and also helps control the hormone responsible for regulating appetite and hunger; insulin.\nWhen Melan is present in low concentrations within the bloodstream, its main function is not just to help control appetite but also, by blocking certain enzymes and blocking the entry of sugar into the cells, helps lower blood glucose levels.\nMelatonin\u2019s main benefits are listed below\nOne of its chief roles is regulating sleep pattern\nMelan has also been found to act as an antidepressant and a sleep aid\nIt helps improve mood, concentration and mental focus\nIn this article, you will learn about how much Melania is taken at sleep, what benefits it has, side effects and risks to the health of those taking it. Let us explore them below.\nHow Much Melon Is Safe To Consume?\nMelaton or Melano is said to be safe to consume at normal levels, and is well tolerated by most individuals.\u00a0 It is suggested that the most popular dosages for melonin are approximately 0.8mg to one milligram, which is enough to provide the desired benefits. Some studies have tested higher doses of 300mg or 400mg in order to see if there are any noticeable side effect.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe FDA has approved doses for patients who take melano as well as non approved dose for those who are taking melaton as part of experimental research and clinical trials. Non approved dosing for clinical testing purposes is 30mg daily and it will only be given to healthy participants in the study that involves meloton as treatment for a specific medical condition, such as insomnia and sleep disorders.\nThis non-approved dosed will allow researchers to experiment with higher amounts of Melanon as they learn more about its effectiveness and potential harmful effects or side issues that may arise from the use of this medication.\nDosage Guidelines For Children Taking melanon\nWhen melanto is used for children, the dosage will vary depending on the age of child receiving treatment. Most popular prescribed dosage is about 75mg which corresponds to about one-half teaspoonful for every ten kilograms of", "This simple question that many people have asked without realising the answer to it will provide a whole new level of sleep quality.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe quality of a person\u2019s sleep can depend on many factors, the most significant one being the quantity of melatoninin in their body. Melatonin helps control the body\u2019s circadian rhythm and is the natural hormone that assists the brain in managing our sleep and wake cycles. It also plays an important role in helping our bodies transition from sleep to being awake, as melantonin levels reduce in the morning and increase in preparation for sleep.\u00a0\nA common question many are asking as we head into 2021 is how much should I take? But, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that everyone\u2019s needs are unique, and meltonin production can reduce with age and sleep deprivation. According to a survey of Canadian adults, almost 25% of Canadians aged 18 and older reported taking nutritional supplements, including melotonin, to help sleep (Health Canada).\u00a0\nIf you feel you could benefit from a better sleep cycle, consult with your health care provider or a medical professional to get a full picture of your heath before taking melontin. If your doctor feels that you are ready to take melatoinin, they can share the right dosage amount for you.\nFor some quick tips on creating a sleep-ready environment for better slumber, check out our video on Youtube by clicking here.", "This is a question that has been asked by many people. The answer to this question is not a simple one. It depends on a number of factors, including your age, your body weight, and your medical condition. In this article, we will discuss these factors and help you to determine how much melanotin you should take.\nMelatonin is derived from the pineal gland, which is located in the brain. This gland is responsible for regulating our sleep-wake cycle. When we are exposed to light, the melatonins in our bodies are suppressed. On the other hand, when it is dark, our pineals glands produce more melantonins.\nSome of the benefits of meltonin include:\nIt can help to improve our quality of sleep.\nIt may help us to fall asleep faster.\nIn some people, it can also help relieve anxiety and depression.\nWhat are the risks of taking too much??\nIf you take too high a dosage, there are a few risks. Firstly, over time excessive melotonin can actually cause the body to stop producing its own naturally. As well as not being able to sleep at all \u2013 meaning no relief from constant tiredness \u2013 you will also find that other related side effects may occur. Some possible symptoms include: vomiting, abdominal cramps, headaches and dizziness. So it\u2019s important to keep track of how often you\u2019re consuming this supplement. Try to remember what time you took it last!\nHow can I reduce my risk if so?\nThe first way is by taking it as directed on the packaging. You should also always talk with a doctor before starting any new supplements. There are also supplements that help reduce anxiety symptoms, like chamomile tea, passionflower extract and valerian root. These ingredients work together to soothe your nervous system so you can relax and sleep better each night. If you want something more natural than pills, consider trying magnesium.\nWhy does my doctor not want me to take them?\nFor most people taking this vitamin supplement is completely safe, except when you are under extreme circumstances that could require medical assistance. For example, if you suffer from heart disease then doctors will advise against taking these supplements because they have negative effects on your cardiovascular health. Other factors include liver and kidney disease, hypertension and seizures. Your doctor may also recommend that you not take melonins if pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers as it might affect your baby\u2019s growth.\nIs there anything other than supplements I should know about?\nIn addition to taking", "\u2013 A question asked by most of the people nowadays due to their lack of sleep. The melatonine is a natural hormonal agent that plays a massive role in preserving your body's regular rhythm by making sure that you sleep soundly at the night.\nThe people that take high dosage melatinine as much as 10mg can experience insomnia instead of sleeping sound. There is many researches conducted by doctor on this side effect issue and now we understand that melantonine causes sleep problem when taking the dose 5mg and more.\nHow Much Melatonin Should I Take?\nIn one research study conducted in UK by using 40mg of meltonine tablet to treat insomnia, the researchers found that it can disrupt the body rhythm as this high dose creates an unnatural body circadian pattern that in turn results in irregularity of your regular sleep pattern and cause a sleep disruption. This research concludes that Melatonie works best at 300 micro gram dosage and that more dosages only contributes to sleep disrupt.\nAnother research was performed in which 17 people were given melitonine supplements where they reported that for 2 weeks they felt no improvement, but afterwards they experienced more sleep disruptions that were more severe on certain days.\nFrom this evidence, we can conclude that the maximum appropriate dosage of this hormone is between 1-5 milligrams and not beyond since that can contribute to insomnia and sleep disturbance.\nWhy is it more important for me to understand How Much Should i Take Melantonie?\nYou do not have to worry over this natural hormone since the only way one can end up with insomnia is when you take large dose of it.\nWhen melantion is not naturally created by your brain for sleep, you may experience several problems like anxiety, restlessness, fatigue, stress, headaches, and irregular sleep period.\nSome people take melatoin even though they do know there is no such problem with their sleep cycle because it helps them to fall asleep at easier ways.\nMany manufacturers have started to market the supplements containing melontoin because they want to get their revenue from this naturally produced hormone. They are now telling people to purchase extra dosings since their brains can no longer produce enough melotonin.\nThis is also why many people ask themselves what should I take to have a good sleep even when they have normal level of melaotonin or even if they are taking a daily dose every day.\nIt shows that there are more melotoin supplements on the market that are being sold without having appropriate amount", "This is a question that many people ask, but the answer can be difficult to find. There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to melatonina; the correct dose depends on many factors, including the individual\u2019s age and medical history. In general, it is recommended that individuals take between 2 and 6 milligrams of melonin per night. However, you should always consult with a doctor before taking any supplement. If you are trying to decide how much to take, there is an online calculator that can help you estimate your dose.\nHow Much Melatonin Should I Take at Night?\nAccording to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, \u201cThe lowest recommended dose of 0.8 mg at bedtime has been shown to be effective in improving measures of sleep efficiency, morning alertness, and mood as assessed by subjective surveys.\u201d However this dose may not be suitable for everyone, so how do you figure out what works best for you? There are a few factors to consider when finding your ideal dose, such as your age, health condition, any medications you take and whether you currently take any sleep aids like melotonin. Once you know these factors you can use online resources like supplements24to find out how many milliliters or mg (micrograms) are in each dose to make sure it\u2019s safe for consumption at nighttime. Just keep in mind that while melitonin may work differently from person to person, some people may feel more awake when using this supplement before bed so finding out exactly how it affects someone could take some trial and error.\u201d\nHow Melatoin Can Help You Sleep\nSleep is the most underrated part of our lives. We spend one third of each and every day asleep. And yet many of us take sleep for granted. Most people don\u2019t know how to get a good night\u2019s sleep and can\u2019t figure it out after trying multiple things, from melatoni to prescription drugs to hypnosis. Sleep deprivation can make people more irritable, depressed and stressed, which can impact their performance on the job or even in family life! For this reason there are supplements available which claim to improve sleep quality without any side effects when taken responsibly (not all of them work though!). A supplement called melatenin contains melonyl lactose, that has many different bioeffects in humans. Researchers believe that meloni may help with insomnia because it increases sleep time by increasing duration of REM (rapid eye movement) stage while decreasing night awakening"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3578, "rouge1_r": 0.2241, "rouge1_f1": 0.2756, "rouge2_p": 0.0278, "rouge2_r": 0.0173, "rouge2_f1": 0.0214, "rougel_p": 0.1468, "rougel_r": 0.092, "rougel_f1": 0.1131, "bleurt": 0.3672, "bert_score_p": 0.8377, "bert_score_r": 0.846, "bert_score_f1": 0.8419, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4587, "rouge1_r": 0.1182, "rouge1_f1": 0.188, "rouge2_p": 0.0463, "rouge2_r": 0.0118, "rouge2_f1": 0.0189, "rougel_p": 0.2385, "rougel_r": 0.0615, "rougel_f1": 0.0977, "bleurt": 0.3948, "bert_score_p": 0.8153, "bert_score_r": 0.8504, "bert_score_f1": 0.8325, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4312, "rouge1_r": 0.195, "rouge1_f1": 0.2686, "rouge2_p": 0.0185, "rouge2_r": 0.0083, "rouge2_f1": 0.0115, "rougel_p": 0.2294, "rougel_r": 0.1037, "rougel_f1": 0.1429, "bleurt": 0.3137, "bert_score_p": 0.8272, "bert_score_r": 0.8531, "bert_score_f1": 0.8399, "hallucination": 22.22222222222222, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4495, "rouge1_r": 0.1158, "rouge1_f1": 0.1842, "rouge2_p": 0.0648, "rouge2_r": 0.0166, "rouge2_f1": 0.0264, "rougel_p": 0.2294, "rougel_r": 0.0591, "rougel_f1": 0.094, "bleurt": 0.3346, "bert_score_p": 0.8121, "bert_score_r": 0.8455, "bert_score_f1": 0.8285, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5046, "rouge1_r": 0.1282, "rouge1_f1": 0.2045, "rouge2_p": 0.0741, "rouge2_r": 0.0187, "rouge2_f1": 0.0299, "rougel_p": 0.2385, "rougel_r": 0.0606, "rougel_f1": 0.0967, "bleurt": 0.3965, "bert_score_p": 0.812, "bert_score_r": 0.8493, "bert_score_f1": 0.8302, "hallucination": 44.44444444444444, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5413, "rouge1_r": 0.1395, "rouge1_f1": 0.2218, "rouge2_p": 0.1204, "rouge2_r": 0.0308, "rouge2_f1": 0.0491, "rougel_p": 0.2477, "rougel_r": 0.0638, "rougel_f1": 0.1015, "bleurt": 0.3542, "bert_score_p": 0.8158, "bert_score_r": 0.8711, "bert_score_f1": 0.8426, "hallucination": 11.11111111111111, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

It could also be other conditions which are as below :\n1. Ovarian cyst : It is common in women of reproductive age. A lump may form on an ovary as a result of hormonal imbalance or ovulation. Most commonly a follicle that contains the egg matures to form a cyst. Sometimes the cyst forms between menstrual cycles. This is called a functional cyst, which is the most common type of ovarian cyst.\n2. Pelvic inflammatory disease : \u00a0This disease occurs when an infection spreads from your vagina or uterus up to your womb's lining or into other organs including fallopian tubes and ovaries or pelvic muscles and tissues. Often times, you may have no symptoms at all. However, if you do have symptoms, they can include bleeding between periods or heavier periods, vaginal discharge (more than usual and sometimes with an unpleasant smell),\u00a0 lower abdomen pain on one side, pain during sex, pain in your lower back or shoulder, nausea and/or vomiting, increased body temperature and a general feeling of being unwell.\n3. Urinary tract or bladder infection : Symptoms are more likely to only be in the urinary tract but sometimes in other areas. They can be fever, chills, feeling sick and sick feeling, frequent, intense urge to urinate while there is a very little urine coming out, painful urination, fever and flu-like conditions. Pain can also spread to the lower tummy or back.\n4. Endometriosis : Endomeriosis is where the lining of the womb is found outside of it. Normally, when the endometrium (lining your uterus) is shed during your period, it travels out of through vagina to out through the vagina. In endomtriosis, some tissues from the inside of uterus travel outside through ovarries, tubes, walls of abdomen, ovarry and tubes. These endomeriosed cells bleed just like the regular uterine bleeding (period) and this may cause lower right abdomen and lower left abdomen pelvic pain.

Alanine transaminase (ALT) is an enzyme found mainly in the liver. Elevated ALT levels may indicate liver injury or disease, which could be caused by a wide range of conditions, such as non alcoholic or alcoholic fatty liver, viral hepatitis and drugs adverse effects. Conditions that injure the liver may also cause gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea. However, diarrhea can also be linked to conditions unrelated to the liver such as gastrointestinal infections. A healthcare provider will investigate abnormal liver enzyme levels and diarrhea by conducting a thorough physical examination, detailed history taking, blood tests, and an abdominal ultrasound if needed.

I had a blood test done and my liver enzymes were elevated. My doctor said that I should not worry about it because it was not a serious problem. However, I still feel worried because I do not know what is causing my diarrhea. Can you please help me understand what could be causing this?\nElevated ALT can cause many symptoms including diarrhea, but it can also be caused by many other things. It is important to get a full evaluation from your doctor to determine the cause of your elevated liver enzyme levels and to rule out any serious underlying conditions. In the meantime, you can try to manage your symptoms by following a bland diet, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter medications such as Imodium or Pepto-Bismol to help control your diarrhea.\nIt is also important for you to be aware of any other symptoms you may be experiencing, such such fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or jaundice. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it\u2019s important that you contact your healthcare provider immediately.\nIn conclusion, elevated levels of ALT may cause symptoms such symptoms as diarrhea but can be due to many different causes. Therefore, if you have elevated enzyme level, make sure to consult with your physician for further evaluation and treatment.\nWhat is ALT?\nALT, also known as alanine aminotransferase, is an enzyme found in the liver that helps to break down proteins. When the level of this enzyme in your blood is higher than normal, this can indicate liver damage or disease. Elevated ALT levels can lead to a variety of symptoms and conditions, including fatigue and diarrhea.\nWhat causes elevated ALP?\nThere are many potential causes of elevated alaninetransferases (ALT), including:\n  1. Viral hepatitis: This is the most common cause, especially in young adults. The most commonly seen viruses are hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ, AK, AL, AM, AN, AO, AP, AQ, AR, AS, AT, AU, AV, AW, AX,", "What could possibly be the reason for this?\nIn addition to diabetes, there are other conditions that may potentially cause high ALT levels. These include liver and kidney disorders, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, gall bladder disease, and hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone). Other liver function tests may help your doctor to make a diagnosis.\nIt would be useful to know which other liver enzymes are elevated, what medications you are on, how often you drink and if liver disease runs in your family. To better answer your health questions we require the full health history of all family members, not just yourself.\nIf you'd like to have another doctor weigh-in on the specifics of your situation, you may want to schedule a second opinion.

I am 45 years old. My ALT was elevated. The doc is saying that this may cause problem of stomach but the question remains - I did not had any problem till now. Can this cause me to have any stomach problem? Please help and let me know.\nIn order for the doctor to understand the clinical situation in detail, he needs to know the elevation of the liver enzyme - ALT. If the levels of AST and ALT in the blood are elevated, then it could mean several things. It could be from fatty liver disease, hepatitis or from cirrhosis of liver. Please note that hepatitis is viral or autoimmune based and hence should not be ignored. Since you have no abdominal complaints (meaning, no diarrhea, fever etc), all is well and the next step should be to get the ALT and AST values checked and then to proceed. In any case ALT by itself should never cause any problems to the abdominal organs and should just mean that the upper part - the hepatocytes of your liver which are meant to metabolize the alcohol is being disturbed.\nThanks for your answer and I appreciate it. Let me ask a specific question related to that.\nALT in my blood test was at 85 and is normal at around 37. Now I do not consume alcohol or meat but I had to increase my protein intake in view of COVID infection. Could this be a reason and why did doc not talk to me but only send me the reports? I will have the test repeated today so that it can be compared.\nIt is not mandatory for you to speak to your doctor every time a blood report is sent. Rather it is the patient who should bring the report to doctor and discuss it in person.\nThe cause of increase in ALT could also be due to intake of herbs, supplements, high fat diet etc. So in most cases, its better to discuss in order to decipher which one is causing the enzyme to be elevated.\nWith elevated liver enzymes, it would be good to repeat AST & ALT after 3-4 weeks to ensure that values have normalised. Any value above 2x normal should warrant an inquiry for further investigations for an underlying cause\nIf the elevated level of ALT causes the protein level to decrease - what should I eat? Currently all protein rich food gets digested by me in about 1 hour.", "I had a stomach virus and all that was diagnosed was that my liver was showing some signs of hepatitis.\nAnytime your blood work comes back abnormal, it is a good idea to have it rechecked to be sure.

A number in fact are:\nAbdominal pain,\nand several other symptoms.\u00a0\nAll of these issues can cause increased or decreased bowel movements. This does not mean that an elevated ALT will cause your constipation or diarrhea to be more extreme.\nIn most cases, it is usually a temporary issue.

What can it be?\nDr. Jayson Bock, University of Pennsylvania Herbert Kean School of Medicine and Dentistry Answered Sep. 26, 2014\nBrown. The appearance of dark urine isn't necessarily concerning. If you have diarrhea, or are drinking a lot more fluids or any colored beverages, then the water can change the color, and can produce a colored urine depending on the pigmentation of the liquid you are consuming. Sometimes taking a multivitamin might change your urine color yellow. Certain medications like iron can also discolor urine.\nCan an amylase or glucose in Urine cause a dark brown color?\nNo way. Only a true pigment such as myoglobin can turn your. Urinre brown.\nIf not, what could be causing a color? Thank you! Read more...\nNo. It could indicate that you're having blood in your stool, but that's usually bright red and more like a burgundy color. Can you tell us what your symptoms are?\nAre dark colored, blood clots normal if you get blood when you poop, it does not come in a normal color is the dark blood with thick blood from your pooping, you do not have a fever or chills or bleeding from urination, only the brown blood and thick stool.\nNo and yes. Bleeding from a colorectal lesion is usually dark black to brown (or burgandy at times). Bleed from an anal fissure is red blood. And sometimes there's a bit of constipation to get mixed in. So a \" dark color\" is not unusual for a blood clot. But yes, darkly colored (usually black or Burgundy) stool with a very thick consistancy is likely due to a mass causing the bleeding in the colon.

However, it would be unusual for you to be having symptoms of an enlarging prostate at your age. It is more likely that your symptoms are due to an underlying infection. If you are not having any luck with the antibiotics, you should see a urologist. A urolgoist is a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract and the male reproductive system. They can do a physical exam and possibly a urine culture to see if there is any infection present.", "I'm really panicking and feel useless and I didn't have any of these symptoms until two years ago. I went to the doctor because my urine stream had become weaker and the only cure he could think of was an operation. To me it feels it was caused by my anxiety but I really don't know. Could you shed some light on this issue?\nHi Dwayne and thanks for your interest in Ben's Fund.\nThe main symptom of an Enlarged Prostate is difficulty in urination, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).\nBen's Brother died of this condition in April 2012 at the age of 23, when I was at University studying for my A levels.\nIf you have developed these problems recently then the fact that you are young could be a good thing, especially if you can find a doctor who has dealt with a lot of younger BPH patients recently. An enlarged Prostrate is generally something that occurs in older men between the ages of about 50 and 70.\nYou say \"my urine had became weaker\" is this what you mean by problems with your urine? Please could explain exactly what the problems are.\nWhat's this about a feeling of panin?\nWhat I mean is that when im on the toliet I have to sit down first and relax myself or otherwise it cannot get out. When i don' sit i feel like it will take me hours. It doesn't happen every time and it's not the type \"when the hell is gonna come out\". It is like when i am not relaxed it just cannot happen. Also, i had been a lazy boy most of my life, not really active at all. And that might be why the prostate has become weak. If i were more actived i believe that this never would've happened. But the thing is if i start doing exercises my body will change a completely different. i have this idea in my mind that if im not used to walk a mile then me going to exercise for an hour after 20 years of not practicing any sport it might not go down well. What i mean here that it would take 6 months to a year to learn how to \"walk\" again. So im kind afraid that i might do more harm than good by doing \"crazy\" exercises. Then again it won't help if I sit on my ass day and night.", "My urination is weak but my stream is large. I have not experienced symptoms of it being difficult to urinate yet. Is this normal for my age? I am not even sexually active.\nI'm a 29 years old female, I'm scared to see the doc because I know they will say \"you are to young for this problem\"... And I've already been diagnosed with hormonal problems. So is it normal?\nHow can I live a normal life and continue to work without feeling pain?", "Will I really have symptoms in my 50s?\nI think you're not quite old enough to be suffering from an \"enlarged\" prostate, but you may fall into a category that has a different label. The term \"Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy,\" (BPH) is another label for this condition. It's not benign for the man that lives with it.\nYou mention your current age and the time frame at which you expect to feel the symptoms. I think I'll put it in a time line. At age 21, a man can enjoy great quality of life and health if he chooses a healthy lifestyle and a sensible diet. Prostate specific health will grow into significance as the years pass. In your 20s, it's important to drink plenty of healthy fluids, and have healthy levels of water stored within the cells, in tissues and in vessels. Water is important for several bodily functions and an important element in maintaining general health.\nThe cells within your reproductive organs function best when provided with a good supply of nutrients. Nutrients are anabolic components important especially to growth of the body. This anabolism results in tissue proliferation, with an element of division and multiplication of cell components to create new cells.\nIn the 10 year age range from 31 to 40 years old, an increase in prostate size can be expected. You can keep the enlargement down by maintaining a diet that is healthy and not overloading yourself with processed carbohydrates. Avoiding excessive alcohol intake is also highly recommended. Remember that it is not unusual for a father to pass a particular gene to his sons. An enlarged or overactive prostate may be hereditary, which is a very complex subject. There have been studies of this nature performed, resulting in some fascinating findings.\nThere is plenty to consider that puts a question mark against the idea that heredity is the biggest cause.\nWe only know that an overgrowth of these cells (prostate) can result in several disorders, symptoms and discomfort to the sufferer. Among those are urinary retention, urinary tract infections, hematuria (blood in the urine) and chronic bacterial prostatitis.\nThese causes of BPH are not fully understood yet. To put the blame fully on a genetic factor would be very foolish. If the disease occurs more frequently in older men, then we should consider the possibility that lifestyle changes or environmental factors, or a combination of some or all these, can trigger", "If my testicles aren't going to drop, what other indications or symptoms may there be that I am becoming a man?\nThe process of the change from a child to a adult male is called puberty. It normally happens between 10 -13 years of age. Puberty is controlled by hormones in the brain, and you can't speed it up or slow it down. A boy usually begins puberty around 1 year after a girl.\nThe start of puberty can be recognised by a range of physical changes, for example:\nThe voice drops and becomes deeper, the body begins to 'grow up', breast buds appear, nipples may start to look more prominent and hairs begin to grow in obvious places (pubic, facial).\nThe hair usually grows in a fairly set order:\n1st - armpits\n3rd - around the nipple and groin\n4th - face\nThe order of appearance of pubic hair is:\n5-10 years - growth starts around anus and genitals\n12 years onwards - hair darkens and spreads to navel/umbilicus\nPuberty can vary from person to person, so there is no 'normal' set of characteristics for all boys.\nIf your penis has continued to increase in size but you believe it is large in comparison to your other friends, then it may be worth coming to the clinic to see a doctor. However, as you say, this may simply reflect differences in personal growth patterns. If you have any concerns, see your doctor for a check-up.\nMy son now 6, has been bleeding from the penis. I initially thought it was urine which was why I was not worried, but now he has had 3 occasions where the blood has come from his penis and I have been unable to stop it...\nRead more of your questions on Testicles and Penis", "?\nI get the pains after I've emptied my bladder... and some times pee and feel the pain, while I am peeing.\nDoes it have anything to do with what I do at uni???\nIf so... how do I reduce it? Do I drink more water, go for walks, less caffeine?\nThanks guys.. sorry if im sounding ignorant but I really dont want to go and do anything if it doesnt need to be done because I cant be assed.\nI've actually heard that this happens sometimes in younger men too- and that it's no laughing matter.\nMy father, on the other hand, got in trouble last night because he wouldn't stop laughing at the thought of another man getting some of the same affliction (we're both prostate cancer survivors in the family, which is an entirely different topic of conversation).\nSo yes. I don't think you're the least bit ignorant, and yes, it is possible you have some prostatic condition going on. You're welcome to call our office in your area (http://www.pcaon-line.com/portal/PATIENT/index.asp) or call the national hotline (1-800-237-2820) and talk to a prostate advisor here.\nOur website also has many articles and helpful information about prostate concerns.\nIn the meantime, there are several things you can do to help ensure the health of your prostate. In particular, a healthy diet will help you keep your gland in top shape and prevent problems later in life.\nHope this was helpful. Feel free to post if you need more information or answers.\nGood luck - you sound like a brave young man taking matters into your own hands like this!\nThe short answer is yes; you could be experiencing an early version of BPH (Benign prostrate hypertrophy). In fact, in many cases an urologist will not see this as \"too\" uncommon either.\nThere are a couple of very important things here that warrant close attention, so you might want (or be able) to see a physician to verify what we're talking about.\nYour symptoms. It sounds like you experience some pain while urinating or after urination. This is consistent with urinary problems with your prostatitis or BHP.

You have to go and get the vaccine. Period. And if you refuse you'll get fired.\nSo no... I don\"t see a big problem with this.\nThe point made earlier by another person is the fact that if there was a cure, vaccine companies like phizer would no longer make money. There just aren't that many new cases anymore to worry about. So what was the point?\nPharmaceutical companies have made billions of dollars on \"treatments\" for Covid, but not a vaccine which has been around for years.\nWe have a system of government in which our rights are given to us by God.\nGovernment does not give rights.\nAnd even though it was ruled \"unconstitutional\", the Covid \"Vaccine Mandate\" was never a right of Government.\nA right is something I have.\nNo one gave me my rights.

Maybe with more diet choices, patients' quality of life could be more improved.\nAs you may know, I have published new scientific findings on Cancer Stem Cell on 11/16/2022. It describes that there may actually be some good news, some possible new insights on cancers in our new era where immunology has played a very important role on how to fight infections such as Covid's.\nHowever you cannot eat all the wrong food and expect any diet to help. There are also many food that may improve immunity and prevent illness or improve health.\nWe don't just want healthy foods at every meal. We may want healthier foods in terms of how it is processed by our body, and our understanding on nutrition has improved immensely. For people that are getting sick every time they have their blood sugar is high, why not lower it to make some progress and see if the next viral infection would be better?\nIt may only be in a perfect world (or maybe we don\u2019t live that long) that new science will make your cells a better \u201cfactory\u201d to process food so in essence you feel the same on any meals so you will not have to worry about your health at all.

Any ideas?\nHello, Shingles is just a recurrence of latent chicken pox virus, dormant in your body. When the virus gets reactivated, it travels along the nerve to your skin producing painful rash. Once your immune system brings it under control, the rash will go away in 3-5 weeks. Some people suffer from this virus again or even many times in their life. This is a very complicated virus and your doctor is only an educated guess for your diagnosis. Please find a neurosurgeon whom specializes in this disease and you discuss his/her own observation and get treatment according to it. If these doctors can't help you out, you can try to see my web-site regarding your disease called \"Shingles in a Nutshell\", or you may find another place for more information. All the best and please get well soon.", "I was diagnosed about 15 years ago and have had shingle pain since the diagnosis from time to time. Is this possible?\nIn my opinion, shingeling, which is a manifestation of reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus (the same as chickenpox, one of the herpes viruses in the family that include HSV), can recur multiple times. Once you have it, it is likely that you will always have the virus in your system but there are likely periods with little or no activity and then periods of increased activity that result in an outbreak (shingles). If you had only one outbreak it would be classified as post-herpatic neuralgia or PHN. However, when it happens more frequently, the condition is called recurrent herpetic neuralgias, or RH.\nRH should be differentiated from postherpic neuralglia (PHN), the PHIN is post-zoster pain of less than six months duration and without associated inflammation. Pain symptoms are thought to be associated with neuropathic changes caused by the original infection followed by nerve damage. PHNI (post- herpes neuralitis) refers to persistent pain after VZV infections in which there is an underlying inflammation within in a sensory nerve. The underlying pathophysiology of PHI and postzoster persistent neuropathy likely differs from PHIS and has a different treatment approach.\nVZ reactivating in older individuals is highly associated to the immune status on which people depend by having the immunoglobulins antibodies for the prevention of VSV disease. With age there occurs a deficiency in this defense, and older than 50 years the risk is much higher. Additionally, there have been reports of a correlation between VSD and autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome (which can be a risk factor for PHV recurrence).", "I have had it twice and both were in the back.\nYes, it's possible to have shingle more then once."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.0597, "rouge1_r": 0.25, "rouge1_f1": 0.0964, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0448, "rougel_r": 0.1875, "rougel_f1": 0.0723, "bleurt": 0.1874, "bert_score_p": 0.8673, "bert_score_r": 0.8101, "bert_score_f1": 0.8377, "hallucination": 71.42857142857143, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3582, "rouge1_r": 0.1805, "rouge1_f1": 0.24, "rouge2_p": 0.0152, "rouge2_r": 0.0076, "rouge2_f1": 0.0101, "rougel_p": 0.2239, "rougel_r": 0.1128, "rougel_f1": 0.15, "bleurt": 0.265, "bert_score_p": 0.8351, "bert_score_r": 0.8484, "bert_score_f1": 0.8417, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5075, "rouge1_r": 0.1762, "rouge1_f1": 0.2615, "rouge2_p": 0.1364, "rouge2_r": 0.0469, "rouge2_f1": 0.0698, "rougel_p": 0.2687, "rougel_r": 0.0933, "rougel_f1": 0.1385, "bleurt": 0.2814, "bert_score_p": 0.8312, "bert_score_r": 0.8636, "bert_score_f1": 0.8471, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4925, "rouge1_r": 0.1514, "rouge1_f1": 0.2316, "rouge2_p": 0.0909, "rouge2_r": 0.0276, "rouge2_f1": 0.0424, "rougel_p": 0.2388, "rougel_r": 0.0734, "rougel_f1": 0.1123, "bleurt": 0.2907, "bert_score_p": 0.8221, "bert_score_r": 0.8478, "bert_score_f1": 0.8348, "hallucination": 57.14285714285714, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6269, "rouge1_r": 0.1484, "rouge1_f1": 0.24, "rouge2_p": 0.1364, "rouge2_r": 0.0319, "rouge2_f1": 0.0517, "rougel_p": 0.3134, "rougel_r": 0.0742, "rougel_f1": 0.12, "bleurt": 0.3515, "bert_score_p": 0.805, "bert_score_r": 0.867, "bert_score_f1": 0.8348, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.0597, "rouge1_r": 0.1905, "rouge1_f1": 0.0909, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0448, "rougel_r": 0.1429, "rougel_f1": 0.0682, "bleurt": 0.1671, "bert_score_p": 0.8555, "bert_score_r": 0.7971, "bert_score_f1": 0.8253, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

You take the probics to replenish your normal gastrointestinal flora.", "Or does it not matter?\nHi, a good rule of thumb is to take the probiotics 2-3 hours before or after the antibiotics. A great probioic that is available is Jarrow's Ultimate Flora Probiotic Ultra 50/50. However, be sure to do your research and talk to your Doctor if you aren't already to see what probitoic they recommend.", "Thanks for the info on your website! Great work!\nThe time is not a matter of any difference since antibiotics work when they are taken in the right amounts for sufficient time. So, one can take probiotics at the same time when antibiotics are being used. One thing is necessary though \u2013 to make sure that probioitic won\u2019t be harmed by antibiotics, so you need to take additional supplements which will protect your body from side effects (and not interfere with antibiotics).

There are many, many beneficial aspects of using a high quality probiotics, but the most important is that good bacteria in our bodies helps us digest nutrients and fight disease.\nDo I need to take probotics? Well that depends on you! If you are a healthy individual who does not have a lot of problems, you may not need a full spectrum probiotc, however there is no harm in taking one. If however, if you have any symptoms of autoimmune disease, like Crohn's Disease, IBS, allergies, acne, digestive problems (gas, bloating, constipation, etc.) or even diabetes, a good probotic will certainly help your health! The body is really a complex system, with many different components all working together. It's not just about good or bad bacteria, or sugar or carbs, it's about balance. For example, some carbs are good, fiber is important, fats are necessary, proteins essential, vitamins and minerals, amino acids and essential fatty acids are important. So when you make your body more robust, healthy and able to fight off disease and bacteria (by eating healthy, getting exercise, staying hydrated), your good (probiotc) and bad (dysbioti) populations get more into balance, this is called a \"homeostatic balance\".\nYou can use a strain specific and have the strains that you choose to grow more in your gut and \"outcompete\" the bad strains. You can choose a spceific strain for different parts of your intestines. Also if your immune system is weak and you feel that it might need protection you can take it with immune support. With these probioitic choices you need no food and it is good to stay away from antiochondral medicines, because they kill the beneficial bacteria.\nWe are all unique, so depending on your needs, there are probitoics to choose from! What does a spectrum of good live bacteria strains mean? It basically means that the probiotoic has a variety of different strains of bacteria. Your choices are different bacteria to target a specific area, one specific strain of baceteria, multi strain probitiotics or whole spectrum.\nYou are your best advocate for taking care of yourself,", "They are not taken together. I had some really really bad diarrhea after having the C. diff. test and when I went to the Dr. office the PA told me I needed to take something or the infection would get worse.

My BP was taken sitting down with both feet together.\nHello, I am hoping that you have not increased your BP since you started the medication yesterday, because it may take at least one week, and even longer before you begin to notice a change.\nYour BP being 140/90 is a pretty darn good number, in fact the numbers you provided represent an almost \"normal\" blood preassure, or a prehypertension. You may wish to consider having a 24 hour monitor of your bloodpressure, which they may place you on before they increase your dosage of lisniproil, the reason being, sometimes the monitoring suggests that the blood pressue is normal for several days straight before it increases, if at all.\nAs far as the calcium intake goes, unless you take the birthcontrol pill to replace your calcium or some kind of vitamin D as well, you should be taking a calcium supplement. Since calcium is really great for your bones, it is good to supplement it. As far and the Grapefruit, there has not been much data suggesting that blood presure is significantly affected by consumption of the fruit. The same is true of salt.

Most often you will get a prescription from your dermatologist. It is possible to find a hydrocr. cream at a drug store. You do have to be careful about dosage and frequency for long term usage. Do not get discouraged by some of the negative talk regarding topical steroids. There has been misinformation out there about how steroids affect skin. As with anything, over dosing can cause unwanted effects. I do not see why it couldn't be used on the face though. If you cannot see a dermatololgist for your rash, I would suggest going the hydro steroid route first to make sure this isn't a fungal. They work to suppress the itching, inflammation, and can kill the fungus if used properly. Since you have used so many creams already, you may have irritated the rash which would mean use would have limited benefits. Make sure you wear gloves, cotton socks and wash hands well after treatment. No need to scrub, just a simple soap and water wash. Any good steroid cream should have instructions on back, but as a general rule, the less you use the better. Apply a thin film to the affected area twice a day for 3 days, take a week off, then repeat as needed, twice weekly. My son has had skin rashes the same as the one you describe. Sometimes they pop up in the mouth and behind the ears. The same thing happened to me as child. His doctor put him in a long course of hydro steroids, every other day to stop the cycle of infection and irritation. We have been able to keep the breaks long enough so to help prevent the break down of his skin and skin infections, we do an ounce of prevention with an antifungal body wash and cream. When we can see the red starting, on his arms and legs, he applies a small dot on each hand and waits 5 minutes to absorb into skin before dressing, this gives us a window for him to change clothes and reduce the inflammation and risk of a rash developing. Just be sure to use gloves with the cream and don't use it more than once a year or so.

It has not been prescribed to you, it is impossible for me to offer a best bet for you. Many times a doctor and/or therapist is involved in order to help with dosage and any other issues that may arise. Trazadone is used for sleep but has been implicated as a drug used in suicides as well, you must follow the doctor\u2019s directions exactly.\nTrazodene belongs to the class of drugs called atypical antidepressants. Specifically, Tazadene is an antidepressant; it increases the activity of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, particularly serotonin, which is very often responsible for mood, sleep, anxiety, behavior, pain perception, sexual function, and many other body functions.\nThe therapeutic effects of antidepressing agents appear slowly, but when effective, will continue for some time after dose reduction even if complete cessation. Therefore a discontinuation of trazedone should not be made abruptly.\nWhile it depends upon the individual, most people do not experience any difficulty upon withdrawal unless they are taking a large (over 200 mg) dose or have developed physical dependence. With physical dependency usually is associated with high dosages, large amounts administered over an extended period (more than four months) and if it\u2019s associated or used as part of a sedative regimen. Physical symptoms may be agitation, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset, tremor, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, crampy abdominal pain, piloerection, flushing, myalgia, headache, seizures, vertigo, incoordination, or confusion.\nWithdrawal should be very slow and steady. If you\u2019ve been on more than 150 mg\u2019s for more that six weeks, a steady tapering of 100 mg per weeks is a good way to wean of on this medication (in other words, go from 250,200,150,100,50). If less then 6 weeks or 50 mg dose is prescribed or less do it even slower and spread the dosage even farther out between periods.\nIf after the taper, symptoms of tolerance, rebound insomnia or agitation appear or you miss a dose one day, stop taper and go back to your previous dose and continue taper 7-10 days. You may want to discuss this", "I take wellbutrin 150 mg 3x a day?\nBefore bed and I need your opinion to be able to sleep well but I am afraid to make you dizzy and that you don't want to continue working and go down\nTrazodene is an antihistamine and you take antinuse medication (phenergan) for migraine prophylaxis. This combination has a very high risk to cause sleepiness and dizziness and it could affect your ability to drive safely.\nOther causes of poor sleep and insomnia can include lack of sleep hygiene techniques, such as no naps, avoid technology 30 minutes before sleep, exercise and eat well-balanced meals, and avoiding consuming food and beverages in large amount 2 hours before bedtime. Alcohol is a sedative but can interfere with sleep through interruption of normal sleep stages.\nIt is best if you can consult a doctor about this to help your insomnia. If you get a prescription for tricorolene, make sure not to use too many sleeping pills in case of addiction. I suggest that if it's a good idea to stop taking tricyclics (doxycycline). This could also help you reduce headaches and migraines.\nI'm sorry about the pain you're going through at the moment. Have you been prescribed your medications by a medical professional? If not, I understand it may be difficult to get the doses and interactions for your medicines from a pharmacy or the drugstore. Talk to your healthcare provider if your physician prescribed the truclopinol medication. You may have some questions to ask.\nThere is no need for you to start taking the medications when you feel dizzy. Once the drowsiness is gone, you have the right to resume taking them.\nTaking medicines to treat insomnia may only improve poor-quality sleep. But it will not improve the number of hours you sleep\nMost people with insomnia don\u2019t need sleep medications. It might be better to try a non-drug treatment first, which is usually more satisfying, has few side effects and can last a long time.", "(morning or night) & where should it be taken?", "Before bed or at night?\nDo not take trzodine at bed time i suggest 1hr before bed and 2hrs after meals.\nDo you take Ambien or anything with it?\nI take benzos before I go to bed.

But it didn't work this time. I didnot get much relief. Maybe I should try using it again. It was very convenient to use metrogenol gel. Do you think it's better than the antibiotic tablets?", "I have had some Bb lesions before too.\nJust an opinion, but I would imagine it's possible that once the infection starts forming and then pops up you will find that other topical creams won't help until both the bacteria and staph have died out and is no longer active. I think both topical cream and tetracycline are effective against non-active stahp and non-bleomycin bacteria, or at least those that are active once they come into contact with the agents. But what would seem to happen is, after you apply the tretinoin and the baccitracin ointment, the mircogel is very effective for killing off newly developing non-infecting bacteria in the open wound for the first 8 hrs or so it is present, and you are left with a less infected wound. In the future i will try to avoid having to use mirtorin gel because the wound doesn't close as quickly, it leaves behind some scarring, etc, especially in areas of the skin that aren't exposed where you can't wash and rinse it often, like the elbow.\nFor now though, I am very, very happy to start healing so quickly and have the chance of healing up as well as I might, so if I need to continue using that oinment through the 5% wound healing stage after the lesion becomes infected, then I will still consider it a good trade off. If I had a choice, i would prefer to heal without the microgel ever being used, of course, that is the best and most effective way to deal with infected skin. And just to be clear, my opinion is that when you pop your acne spot, you should wash the area with hot soapy water as soon as you remember, if you dont you might have missed getting out some of those infection-causing bacteria when your cut the head open, because it can start forming very slowly, with no noticeable pain or signs, over the next several hours, as your blood and wound liquid comes into close contact. This is one reason I wash my hands, arms, mouth, teeth, hair etc., before and after I cut a spot open and am always careful not to pick at spots when my skin is open.\nI hope that your situation improves. Just remember to wash with very hot water, keep all clothing, hands etc clean and stay away from spots that you know or suspect are about to burst. Good luck", "I also dont understand the need for oral meds. Wouldnt these be taken via a skin injection? Could someone help me understand what I am missing?\nThis is just my opinion, not a professional medical opinion. The problem with Mirogel is that it's hard to put enough in a gel to make it effective... it doesn't really have much skin penetration.\nOn top of that, if there are nodules and pus forming on top, that will block the ointment from getting through. I would recommend having them biopsied and put on antibiotics right away, even if that means oral antibiotics.\nIf the nodlges were bacterial in nature, the Miregel wouldn't have done anything to begin with. It has no anti-bacterial properties (as is common with topical acne treatments). Only antibiotics will treat a bacterial infection and that is done with an oral route (pills, eliquis/liquids, or injections).\nIf they are not bacterial, they still have to be treated as soon as possible since they could be a precursor to an infection, which will be much harder to treat.\nTopical medications, like the miregal, is intended for acne, pustules, and the likes. Anything that requires a higher dosage of an antibiotic, will need to go through the mouth.\nThe oral medications are also supposed to minimize scarring, due to a faster healing time.\nHi, thanks.

Because of a 3-4cm incision, I got lots of scab, as well as 6-7 puncture incisions in the scar. But the doctor said at that point it should heal nicely. 2+ years later, there is still a crater size scar in my butt cheek, in addition to the keloids.

If the pain is localized to one area and isn't too bad, then you may want to continue activity for a few days after the swelling has gone down, and then rest.\nIn this case, rest for you means sitting on the couch and icing the leg for 10 minutes every hour.

At this point my advice is to try to walk a little every day, only for as long as it's comfortable for the calf muscle.", "(2012)\nI've had a sore throat, muscle fatigue, and a cough for about a week. I've been running 8-10 miles a day in this condition. My cough seems to have gone away and the soreness is mostly in my triceps and arms, though they have been sore for quite some time now. If I was just resting the pain seems not to go away, however if I continue to run it subsides. At first it seemed like a cold sore. However it is still going on and I haven't run for 3 days. Should I seek a medical evaluation if it continues?\nThe only thing that helps these symptoms is exercise. When I stop, they get progressively worse.\nYes, exercise aggravates the symptoms. It doesn't actually worsen it, it aggravate it because when you stop exercising the muscles you used are sore and tight. This causes more tension on other parts of your body (specifically the upper back and neck). Eventually this all can add up and cause headaches.\nThe main symptom of a muscle imbalance caused by tightness in your shoulders is to cause an increase in blood pressure. Even if you don't have high blood sugar, you can experience high cholesterol, elevated risk of blood vessel damage, high triglycerides, low metabolism, etc. As well, tight muscles are the leading cause of heart problems and stroke.\nYou can try some of the ways below that I'll list. But first, get your blood checked for low sugar. You may want to see your physical therapist and find out why the inflammation in the first place, because this is your best defense against it.\nI'd also recommend to stretch your arms and your upper body.\nWhen you are exercising your tricep, stretch it by doing trapezius stretches, which are to be done 20 times three times a year. These exercises are also good for all shoulder muscles.\nTo do tris: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place your hands directly on top of one another. Push your chest forward and back, feeling the force of both your legs and shoulders. Hold for a count of five seconds before repeating. Repeat the following exercises for one more set. Return the arms to the original position and begin the movement over again. Do 15-20 reps.\n2. Lateral raises\nThe most effective exercise to target the tricp muscles is the lateral raise. Stand, holding a dumbbell in each hand", "I have a number of ailments, so your opinion on this would be useful. Thank you!\nDear C. J.\nThe good news is your muscle pain, which is almost certainly caused by a muscle strain, is most certainly exercise-induced, and this may well indicate that your fitness has improved and your physical condition is improving. However, there is also bad news.\nFirst, you should discuss the extent and source of muscle soreness with your primary care physician, as the fact that it is more marked after exercise when you may be breathing more deeply and working your heart harder can be an indication of a heart problem in a small number. of people and the heart should be evaluated to rule out serious heart problems in anyone with persistent muscle problems and significant exercise.\nSecond, any persistent or worsening musculoskeletal pain should also be discussed with the GP, ideally someone who has evaluated your musculature \u2013 for example, an orthopedist or rheumatologist. The muscles are often involved by rheumatic diseases, such as rheuma, arthritis and polymyalgia rheum\u00e1tica, sometimes in association with other more minor rheumas, other times without any other associated rheunas.\nThird, I will also recommend that you talk to a physical therapist at an appointment to assess whether you are using good form in your exercise or have developed poor habits. For example: do you breathe heavily while exercising? Are you breathing through your nose? Your chest rises? Do you try to hold your breath while you strain to move the load? To what extent do your movements involve the entire length of your arms and legs in extension? Is your spine maintained while lifting the heaviest weights? When you walk, do the movements come directly and sequentially from your ankles, or do they involve your toes and upper limbs?\nFourth, try working harder while moving more gently. That is, if you\u2019ve been using light weights for the upper body, increase the weights slightly and continue using a full range of motion but not a very heavy resistance. Use the lightest weight possible that makes you a little bit fatigued when pushing through the whole range."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.069, "rouge1_r": 0.1212, "rouge1_f1": 0.0879, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.069, "rougel_r": 0.1212, "rougel_f1": 0.0879, "bleurt": 0.1974, "bert_score_p": 0.8408, "bert_score_r": 0.8317, "bert_score_f1": 0.8362, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.1034, "rouge1_r": 0.1333, "rouge1_f1": 0.1165, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.069, "rougel_r": 0.0889, "rougel_f1": 0.0777, "bleurt": 0.2242, "bert_score_p": 0.8517, "bert_score_r": 0.8495, "bert_score_f1": 0.8506, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3793, "rouge1_r": 0.0863, "rouge1_f1": 0.1406, "rouge2_p": 0.0175, "rouge2_r": 0.0039, "rouge2_f1": 0.0064, "rougel_p": 0.2241, "rougel_r": 0.051, "rougel_f1": 0.0831, "bleurt": 0.2706, "bert_score_p": 0.811, "bert_score_r": 0.8442, "bert_score_f1": 0.8273, "hallucination": 88.88888888888889, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.2241, "rouge1_r": 0.0909, "rouge1_f1": 0.1294, "rouge2_p": 0.0175, "rouge2_r": 0.007, "rouge2_f1": 0.0101, "rougel_p": 0.1379, "rougel_r": 0.0559, "rougel_f1": 0.0796, "bleurt": 0.2716, "bert_score_p": 0.839, "bert_score_r": 0.8494, "bert_score_f1": 0.8442, "hallucination": 88.88888888888889, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4138, "rouge1_r": 0.0577, "rouge1_f1": 0.1013, "rouge2_p": 0.0175, "rouge2_r": 0.0024, "rouge2_f1": 0.0042, "rougel_p": 0.2759, "rougel_r": 0.0385, "rougel_f1": 0.0675, "bleurt": 0.2732, "bert_score_p": 0.7941, "bert_score_r": 0.8429, "bert_score_f1": 0.8178, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4655, "rouge1_r": 0.075, "rouge1_f1": 0.1292, "rouge2_p": 0.1053, "rouge2_r": 0.0167, "rouge2_f1": 0.0288, "rougel_p": 0.2931, "rougel_r": 0.0472, "rougel_f1": 0.0813, "bleurt": 0.3133, "bert_score_p": 0.8052, "bert_score_r": 0.8652, "bert_score_f1": 0.8341, "hallucination": 44.44444444444444, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

What may work for one person may not work as well, if at all, for another.\nYou can usually just half your dosage for each week, stopping once your new level feels like good. I wouldn't do less than 3 months in between each reduction as some people really need the whole three months, some don't.\nHow are you getting along now? How do you know if need a higher dose then before? (you'll know! ;) )\nYour Prozac dose was only about half the max you could take, so if you do decide to start up again, maybe your doc will be willing to increase your dose. At this point though, the only reason you would want to is if something significant has happened - e.g. a severe episode where you actually had to see a dr for a couple doses of benzos - or if there was severe negative change in your moods.\nThe best way to determine if this therapy (Prozac) is working for you is to measure the outcome using a valid and reliable instrument (e.g mood diaries, or the HRSD or SADI ) to monitor your mood. If it were to work, you should certainly look for positive change (i.e. lower scores on the scale).", "Would I have an allergic reaction?\nFor most medications, you should reduce the dose when stopping medication so as to avoid side-effects. This can be accomplished by adjusting the doses of SSRI's over a period of weeks or by the use of one of a number of drug treatments aimed at \"detoxing\" from SSRR's. Although a rapid stop may precipitate a withdrawal syndrome, this can also occur with withdrawal of any CNS drug (caffeine, alcohol) or a sudden return to a drug previously used, such as from Valium to benzodiazepine-free alcohol. I don't know if any of this applies to your situation though.\nHow fast should I take Zoloft?\nIf I'm taking Lexapro 20 mgs, do I need to take a low-dose to come off it if I decide to quit?\nI have been taking Seroquel for 6 weeks but was prescribed Lexprop when my insurance changed.

I noticed at about 25mg a significant difference in my mood but have also noticed a lot more anxiety.\nYes, there is a tapering period off the medication as sudden withdrawal from antidepressants is not recommended. Symptoms of withdrawal can include any of those you have listed along with headache, nausea and the general flu like sensations. As the levels of medication decline from your system the severity of symptoms you experience will also decline and are likely to be manageable with over the counter medications.\nAs to whether the problem you are having with your doctor's recommendation of 80mg per day of prozac versus your preference for Zolift is likely based on your reaction to Proxac.\nThe Zoflf would be a good choice if you can tolerate the increased anxiety you mentioned as the two medications are very similar in effectiveness but Zolfi also treats the anxiety more effectively than does Proxc.\nBest of Luck!

I did start having headaches by the fourth day, but they dissipated. My head started hurting by Sat/Sun morning & they lasted all day. By the following Sat. morning, they were gone. Prosaq was really starting to get to me - I was beginning to notice side-effects that kept me from functioning at a high level. Don't worry - you will make it. Keep us updated & tell us how everything's going.\nI weaned off of Proxzac the hardest way possible. Cold turkey. And, I didn't experience any problems.\nHowever, as all of us know, we all respond differently. Since you're not completely aware of how you'll respond, it's most advisable to take baby steps and slowly ween off.\nIf you take more than 5 Proxiax at once, you have a chance of becoming addicted. This won't necessarily happen, unless you are extremely sensitive to medication. If you do experience withdrawal, the effects will be felt after you stop taking the medication, not beforehand.\nMost people, however, have no problem weanning off with little to no withdrawl effects.\nGood Luck, and if you want help we'll be glad to try and talk you through it.\nWe all have our own way. When I went to see a counselor, she helped me with this. It is not a problem.\nBut, if we are to keep you on Proac, our medical director had to sign off. You are no longer taking our medication (since Proxac is considered a PSSD med). You may have done Proaxac when you were in our progam, since the med program doesn't check if the meds are SSRI's, SNRIs, Prostaglandins, or Pro", "Also would the nausea and tremors become worse before it got better with me or the other way?\nIf you want to withdraw from your medication, you should do so under a doctor's care.\nIf he or she allows you to do it, then do not feel \"forced to commit suicide\" you will be there to be helped.\nWhen it's time to discontinue treatment, I advise a two-week taper. (Some people are fine with a four-week period, but my clinical experience is that most people need two weeks). It's important to note that any withdrawal symptoms experienced during a taper or following discontinuation need not be debilitating in any way. They only need to prompt a return to the prescribed medication to resume a safe rate of withdrawal. It is not uncommon for a withdrawal-emergent depression to strike about an hour after a pill is missed. If you start to feel depressed, take the pill. There's no great harm in that, and then the next night miss the second pill, etc., until you are entirely off the medication.\nI was on a 40 mg dose, which I was taken for 2 1/2 years. I stopped taking it due to anxiety and heart palpitations. After talking to my doctor, he said it would take four weeks to two months to get my body to detox off this medication (the way he described it to me). Within days, my heart would be racing constantly throughout the day, the anxiety was worse, no sleep with the constant fear of dying, shaking, headaches, dizziness, nausea, sweating, feeling sick to throw up, aching joints, it felt like everything in my stomach was churning over and over. These are just some of things that I went through because of suddenly stopping the drug.\nAfter four months of what I felt was hell, with no relief from any of these symptoms, (with the exception of a mild headache and insomnia), I called my pharmacist and asked if taking 45 minutes to 60 minutes Zantac tablets would help. He gave me a brand new bottle of them, three tablets three times a day on an empty stomach, not with food. This is what saved me.

You could have this phenomenon due either to urinary tract infection (which has been mentioned), or possibly from direct pressure on your bladder from the tenderness/swelling at that area.\nThe best test is to see if you or your Son have urine left in your underpants or a pad, if applicable, by night.

Your description of 'waking up' is exactly what I experienced about a year after my first child was born, and it was as if I 'woke up', began to look at my life differently, began seeing things that were wrong in my world differently or from a new lens, became sick, was on my own in a lot of ways for my personal life and health in ways I never had before, stopped doing things I found problematic for myself and my family, felt 'forced' to think differently for no other reason that I believed I was no longer 'okay' with the world as it had been for quite some time. Once I gave myself permission to view the 'old normal' in this way, there was a tremendous feeling of rightness and peace at the time, but it does cause a huge amount of anxiety for anyone who has lived 'the way things are done' for so long. There are some people who choose this as something to explore by necessity for their lives, or for others who may be stuck.

It is produced at a constant rate by the body, and is excreted by your kidneys. A creatnine level of 1.0-1,4 mg/dL is considered normal. If your level is higher than that, it means that your kidney function is impaired.", "Is there a way to convert creatine monohydrate to mg?\nCreatine Monohydride 4 grams is equivalent to 300 mg of creatiine.\nThere are also other forms of powdered creatoine out there.

Creatine is produced by the body to build muscle and is one of the three nitrogenous components used in metabolism. The other two are ammonia and urea. These are released from muscles during the act of muscle contraction.\nCreatinine itself does not harm the kidneys but the creatin is toxic and when it is released it can cause problems. It is important to have a balanced diet and to limit any excessive activity or exercise you do, as well as to avoid excess of alcohol, tea or coffee. I urge you to see your doctor as this could really harm you kidneys in the long run and damage their function on a permanent basis.\nAs creatinus is a normal waste product produced in you body, it should not be very high.

How are you feeling?\nNo, creatinin is not muscle. They aren't sure what causes some people to have high levels but they now believe certain medications that are not metabolized can cause some problems. Certain NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may actually build up to a higher amount in some individuals and some experts think this may be associated with renal issues.\nOther medications, such the diuretic thiazide, also can be a culprit.\nIs this the result of a drug screen?\nHave you discussed this with your doctor?

Many people suffer from cold sore outbreaks and their symptoms, while others can't help but stare each time the cold is on someone for fear that they might catch the nasty virus. It is easy to get infected from this herpes simplex virus since it is commonly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, like kissing someone with cold lesions. The virus is also easily spread by sharing common objects like towels, glasses, or utensils using with an infected person. Once you are infected, the virus could become so dormant that it won't trigger symptoms for a very long period of time. Since there is no known cure for herpes, most people tend to prevent or treat their cold symptoms.\nFor centuries, there have been all sorts of herpes treatments from natural remedies to pharmaceutical drugs which claim to be effective for curing herpes. You'd be surprised to learn that many common household products can cure herpes and the common cold as well. In fact, many people have found it cheaper and more effective to buy over-the-counter herpes treatment than to spend hundreds of dollars for prescription drugs. While some may work for mild or intermittent cold outbreaks, some herpes OTC products could also be ineffective in treating the outbreaks of cold. Let's take a closer look at these herpes so-called remedies.\nAspirin and NSAIDs. There is nothing like a good analgesic for relieving pain and swelling from a cold lesion. Aspirins relieve pain by masking your perception of a pain signal from your nerve endings. For a while, you won\u2019t be able to feel the pain. If the herpes sore becomes blister-like, aspirins can also help relieve the burning sensation at the blister. NSAIDS also work the same way as aspirin.\nTopical antiviral medicines. To treat herpes effectively, topical antiseptic creams or ointments could help in preventing the spread of the infectious virus and killing the blisters.

The study, published in the journal Cancer, found that the vaccine can reduce the risk of cervical and other cancers by up to 90 percent. HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause cervical, anal, and oral cancers. It is the most common sexually-transmitted infection in women, with more than 80 percent of women infected with HPV at some point in their lives. In the United States, HPV causes about 20,000 cases of cancer each year. While the HPV vaccine is not a cure for HPV, it can prevent the virus from causing cancer. \"The HPV vaccination is an important tool in preventing cervical cancers,\" said Dr. David A. Gans, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in this study.\nAugmentation of the Immune System with the Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine\nThe study was conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the National Cancer Institute. They analyzed data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and found a significant reduction in cervical HPV infections among women who received the vaccination. This reduction was seen in both women and men. However, the researchers found no significant difference in HPV infection rates between women with and without the infection. According to the study's authors, this suggests that HPV vaccines may be effective in reducing the incidence of HPV-related cancers in men and women. Dr.\nGans said that this is good news for women because it means that they can get the protection they need without having to worry about the side effects of taking the drug. He added that it is important to note that there are still some risks associated with taking HPV vaccinations. For example, there is still a risk that women will develop cervical or other HPV cancers after taking a HPV shot. There is also a small risk for developing other types of cancers, such as breast cancer and lung cancer.\nThe researchers also found some evidence that taking an HPV injection may increase the likelihood of developing cervical precancerous lesions. These lesions are precursors to cervical carcinoma, which is one of two types that are most commonly associated HPV. Cervical precancers are usually detected by a Pap test, but they are not always detected.

The condition can cause redness, swelling, itching, burning, or discharge from the eyes. Blepheris is not usually serious and can often be treated with over-the-counter eye drops or ointments. However, if the condition does not improve after a few days or if it is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever or vision changes, then it may be necessary to see a doctor.\nWhat are the symptoms of Blep?\nThe symptoms can vary depending on the cause of your blepha. If you have bacterial blephas, you may experience red, swollen, irritated eyes, discharge, crusting around your eyelid, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, pain, fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain or stiffness, muscle aches, skin rash, sore throat, cough, runny nose, sneezing, congestion, earache, sinus pain and pressure, toothache or jaw pain.\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms, please see your doctor as soon as possible.

Your doctor will likely recommend one of two options: topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics. Topical antibiotics are applied directly to your eyes and work by killing the bacteria that is causing the infection. Oral antibiotics work systemically, meaning they are taken by mouth and travel through your bloodstream to reach the site of infection.\nYour doctor may also recommend other treatments such\nWhat causes Blephe?\nA number is of causes for Blephas. Some of them include:\nBacterial infections: Bacteria can enter the eye through cuts or scratches on your skin, contact with contaminated objects, swimming in contaminated water, etc.\nViral infections : Viruses can also cause blepas.

Answer\u00a0 Most people are familiar with pink eye as it is highly contagious, however blepraharities is not.\u00a0 Blephalratis is caused by bacterial infections and a build up of oil and dead skin cells on the edge of your eyelids. The bacteria often starts in the eyelash follicles, where the hair and oil glands sit. Over time, a small build-up forms into large, dry scales. As the bacteria grows and thrives on your eye, it can spread to your lid. There are many ways that patients can become affected. Blepherhatitis can start as a mild condition, and most of the time you can simply wash it away or remove the crust with warm water and gentle cleansers. However, when not treated, the irritation will persist and may become a chronic condition. We recommend a simple warm cleaning routine:\u00a0 Wash your hands thoroughly or use a paper towel to clean your lids. Then, very gently clean the eye lid using a baby wipe or a cotton ball and warm, soapy water. Avoid rubbing your eyes to make sure you remove bacteria and oils. It\u2019s always recommended that you visit a professional for a regular cleaning every few months.", "Blepharys is a condition associated with inflammation of the eyelids and the surrounding area. Bleparis may be a primary condition, that affects the outer surface of your eyelid, or a secondary condition that occurs together with a different condition. There are numerous types of bleparisis, together and separately. Most common are Blefaritis (inflammatory Bleapharisis), Meibomitis, Malignant (malignancy) Bleaparisi and Chalazion.\nAlthough blefarisis is not a severe condition and has no serious complications, the itching and redness that appears on the skin of eyelashes and eyelasts can cause severe discomfort to the person.\nBlefaritises often appear on both eyelists at the same time, and even though they are not contagious, they may also appear one eye but rarely.\nIf you have red, blurry and swollen eyelash, you should consult with your eye doctor immediately.\nThere are two types; inflammatory blepheritis and non-inflammatory\nThe signs and symptoms of bleeding appear vary depending on type.

Blepharo means \u201ceyelid\u201d and itis, is a Greek suffix meaning \u201cinflammation.\u201d So, blepha-ritis literally means inflammation around the eye. In blephiari-tis the inflammation happens on the edges of your eyelashes. This causes your lashes to appear dirty and crusty and also causes the lashes themselves to stick together. Many times an individual will rub their eye which will make the situation much worse. When this occurs it is termed ble-pha-ro-coconjunctitivis if the conjunctiva (a thin film that covers the eyeball and the inside of eyelids) is involved.\nThis inflammation can also have a viral (caused by certain viruses) etiology, in which your immune system is reacting to these particles. The most common presentation of this inflammation is the formation of foamy-appearing dandruff like material that accumulates on your upper eyelid. Some people may have an allergic etiolgoy of blep-ariitis, which can mimic contact dermatitis. There are also a variety of other causes of Blepha-roritis such as meibomian gland dysfunction, demodecicosis, seborrheic dermatitits, and staphylococcal bleprhitis.\nYes, the disease itself is contagious. However, it does not necessarily jump from person to person. It has more to do with the type of bacteria that are causing the bleppharitis and what type the sufferer has. For example if one is suffering from stafhylococcus aureus bleparosis then they would spread the same form of disease as the other person who suffers from the stapylococus bacteria. You can contract bleaparosis or other contagious diseases by touching the bacteria laden eyelash hairs in the patient who is having an active episode of infection.

This condition is common in older people because the oil may thicken with age. It can also occur due to excessive sebum production with hormones.\nTreatment Options for Blepharatitis\nThere are several treatment options for blephaaritris like antibiotic and antiseptic ointments, eye care, and surgery. Antibiotic treatment includes oral and topical antibiotics. Sometimes, treatment may continue indefinitely till signs of inflammation are removed and then relapse. Eye care for this includes cleaning the lashes and lid margins with a warm towel.\nIf the disease cannot be controlled, surgery is used. The surgery involves removing the bacteria infected glands on the lid margin, which prevents discharge and relieves inflammation. An eyelash conditioner should also be used to prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria under the lash. Antiseptics that contain the following medications are used in blepaaratitis: erythromycin and azithromyci.\nThe doctor may use a special instrument or wire brush to clean the outer root of your lashes. To prevent bleparaaritiis recurrence, a prescription for a topical medication is given in this condition. If the condition returns, the best treatment option for your symptoms is using a lubricant and a cold compress.\nIt is important to mention that bleparitis is not contagious, contrary to the common misconception, but the underlying causes of blepraaraarits can. Thus, you need to treat the cause rather than the symptom. Treatment options that can be effective in treating blepraraditis include antibacterial ophthalmic drops and eyelifts.\nSurgery is another option to remove the meibomian gland to restore the natural drainage. You can do an eyeliner or bleach if the bacterial culture test comes back positive. Consult your doctor for advice, particularly if you are using medicine prescribed by him/her, such as antibacterials. Although it is a rare disease, it can affect almost anyone and is rarely life-threatening.\nMost Common Causes & Symptoms of Bleharatitis\nBeyharitis causes the lining of eyelids to develop redness, swelling, itching, irritation of vision and burning of eyes.

What are the symptoms of flu? How long does flu last? Is flu contagious? Can you get flu from a flu shot? These are some of the questions that we will answer in this article.\nFlu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, depending on the person\u2019s age and health. The flu is different from the common cold, which is caused mainly by other viruses.\nThe flu can be spread by coughing, sneezing or talking. People with the flu are most contagious in the first 3-4 days after their illness begins. Some people may be contagious for longer than 4-5 days.\nThere are many different types of influenza virus. Every year, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends which flu viruses should be included in flu vaccines. These recommendations are based on which viruses are circulating worldwide and which ones are likely to cause the most illness.\nInfluenza viruses can change over time. This is called antigenic drift. When this happens, people who have already had the virus may not be protected from new strains. That\u2019s why flu shots are updated every year.\nWhat is influenza?\nIn the United States, influenza, commonly known as the \u201cflu,\u201d is an acute respiratory infection caused primarily by the influenza A and B viruses. Inflenza is highly contagious and can spread quickly from person to person. Symptoms of Inlflueza include fever, chills, body aches, headache, cough, sore throat and fatigue. More severe cases can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis and other complications.\nHow is flu different than influenza?\nThe main difference is that flu refers to any type of respiratory virus that causes symptoms such as fever and cough. On the other hand, Inluenza specifically refers only to the type A or B influenza strains that cause these symptoms.\nIs the Flu Test the Same as In Inuflua Test?\nThe answer is no. A flu virus test is used to detect the presence of a specific type or subtype of virus in a sample, while an influenza (flu) test can detect any strain of this virus.\nA flu (influent) virus is one that belongs to either the Inuenzavirus A (IAV) or Inuezivirus B (IBV). These viruses cause seasonal flu epidemics every winter in temperate regions around the world. They", "what is the difference? What factors affect the outcome of influenza rapid test?

In other words, if you have influenza, you are sick with \"the flu\" and you will recover on your own. For those with weak hearts, flu can lead to a severe heart attack.\n1. Is influenza a common infection?\nIn order to understand flu and influenza symptoms and why not to confuse these two terms with influenza A, B, and C, it is important to know these terms and their meanings:\nInfection: A general disease is caused by pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. To get into your system, a pathogen needs to enter your body through contact with your nasal or oral mucosa, inhalation into the lungs, or injection with a needle or other object.\nFlu: This is a specific type of viral infection. It affects your immune system and makes you feel sick and exhausted. This might make it difficult for you to carry out usual functions like going to work or school.\n2.

They also include the flu-like symptoms of fever, chills, joint pain, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, cough, congestion, vomiting and diarrhea.\n3. How is flu detected?\nThe flu is not a new disease. The symptoms are very similar to the common cold. You can get it from being around sick people or by touching something that's already been in contact. There are two types of the influenza virus: Type A and Type B.

Why is it important not confuse flu with flu?\nYou should not confusions flu (inflamed respiratory tract) with the winter flu symptoms (fever, severe sore throats) because they are different diseases. While the term flu refers mainly to symptoms associated with respiratory disorders (such as colds); the word \u201cflu\u201d indicates an acute infectious illness that manifests itself in different ways according to each infection type.\n5. Common misconceptions about flu\nPeople often think of \u201cthe Flu\u201d", "Does flu season come before or after cold season?\nInfluenza, generally known in society as The Flu, is a commonly occurring respiratory illness caused by a viral infection. It is highly communicable and spread quite easily. It causes symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and cough. Influeza generally occurs during the same seasonal changes that also occur for the common cold. The influenza virus can be diagnosed via blood tests or viral culture tests. These are some of the most common viruses found to be in people who test positive for influenza.\nFlu is not the scientific name for Influxa!\nDespite the popularity of this terminology among the masses, the term Flu does not refer to scientific naming of influenza viruses or viruses. This is because scientists, medical doctors and other authorities in healthcare do not use the terminology to refer scientific nomenclature.\nThis is just a common vernacular term that most people prefer to use when referring to their symptoms during common bouts of respiratory infections. Even if you are not in the medical sciences, there are plenty of other ways that you can learn about the terms that are used in influenza, including common names. You should read all the related terminology, such common synonyms, in order to develop a more holistic understanding of how the illnesses are classified and diagnosed.\nIn order for an illness or disease to have the classification of being 'influing', it must meet specific scientific criteria. Therefore, not all influenza cases are the exact same - each case has a different diagnosis and treatment depending on the virus, symptoms, length of recovery, etc\nThis condition is typically diagnosed according the symptoms you experience, along with your medical history. If you have any known allergies or other illnesses that have already compromised your immune system, your doctor may prescribe medication to increase your white blood cell count or to help alleviate any allergies symptoms. There are also various antibiotics and antivirals that can also be used. Depending on your specific case and your physician's recommendations, you may receive either oral medications or injections for treatment. Treatment plans may also vary and can include lifestyle changes such a increased water intake, avoidance of exposure to those who are already sick, decreased physical activity, taking vitamins and medications like Ibuprofen, Tylenol, cough syrups, decongestants and many other options.\nIt should be noted that there is currently no cure for this virus - only treatments can help you feel more comfortable and able to reduce the negative impacts that influenza has on you.\nWhen is the ideal", "If I have symptoms of cold (fever, runny nose, slight muscle pain and some cough), should I go for an influenza PCR test?\nAn Influenza swab test is specifically done to diagnose influenza infection. If influenza is suspected, it is best to check for antigen, especially during outbreak or seasonal epidemics. These antigen tests are easy and inexpensive which makes it possible for wide-scale testing. Sometimes, a confirmatory PCR can be performed for a specimen of an infected patient that tested positive with the antigen test.\nIn contrast, influenza swabs are sent out to commercial labs by general practitioners, while the influenza tests use rapid results.\nWhat is the significance of flu tests?\nThere are a few key differences between Inverse Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and a standard nasal swirch test for Infections. PCR is a test which uses genetic material specific to a particular virus, such as Infection (H1N1), to create positive results. A nasal swap requires a specific person-to-person contact and direct contact with an Infected person. There are other differences as well, but these are the two most important.\nWhile there are some positive aspects to obtaining a PCR from a commercial laboratory, there is also a concern about the reliability of such tests. For one, the quality of testing is very poor as not all specimens are collected correctly. In addition, some providers don\u2019t adhere to standard protocols, so the results may be inaccurate.\nPCR testing can also be quite dangerous to people, as it can cause contamination with live Inflections. This is especially important when used for medical purposes, because a sample needs to be taken in order for the test to detect Inflection. The sample should be as clean as possible, and not contain any dead or unprocessed specimens.\nThe test results should also show no sign of infection, which is particularly important for people who are at high risk. It is important to avoid any possible contamination from the swatch process.\nA PCR swish may not be enough to give you a definitive diagnosis, even though it\u2019s the most reliable type of test. Fortunately, most people recover from flu without experiencing any adverse effects. However, this is because influenza does not cause significant problems or even fever in most patients.\nFlu tests should not necessarily be done in conjunction with a nasal sample.\nAre flu PCR tests accurate?\nAre there any reasons why the PCR Test is not 100% accurate in diagnosing influenza? It doesn\u2019t work for all viruses. Some", "or is influenza same (identical ) as flu\nis test for influenza identical with test to flu?\ninfluenza is simply a synonym for the flu, therefore no difference\nthe influenza virus is a specific strain of flu viruses (types A,B or C)\ni don't know if the terms are used interchangeable, but they mean the same.\nThe terms \"flu\" and \"influensa\" are interchangeable when it comes to the common cold virus. You can call it both, it is both of the influenza strain.\nInflusena is the result of a virus infecting a host, specifically from the Influisna virus, while flu is just a description of any viral infection that affects the respiratory system, and is not caused by the inlfuenzia virus.\nthe InFluenZa virus may cause the FlU\nYes the two are same, because of virus\nin fact it may also be called common flu.\nwhat is difference between influenza type A and B\nThe Inlfuensz virus can only infect the throat, nose, lungs or bronchi, wherease the Flu can affect other parts of our body. And the treatment of these infections that occur are different too.\nHowever, a common viral cold can be referred to as either InlFluensa or Flue (both the viruses are caused to same body part - throat.)\nis influenza a chronic disease\nIs influenza fatal disease?\nDo you have coughing?\nCan influenza be treated by antibiotics?\nwhat are the best treatment for flu virus? and how do we prevent the risk?\nWhat is seasonal influenza?\nHow long does influenza last? how long i have to isolate my self after being diagnosed?\nI have influenza and i feel really low for an example, my mood is always low? is it normal?", "If you have never heard of this question, then you must have read this article. This is not something you can see every day. However, this is important because we can always protect ourselves from the flu virus.\nWhat is a influenza virus?\nAn influenza or flu is viral respiratory disease. It infects only the upper respiratory tract, not the lungs. The flu affects the body in a variety of ways. Flu is often described to have symptoms of fever, colds, headaches, muscle aches, and sore throats. People who have the infection may also have diarrhoea and vomiting. A person may infect others with this disease within 5 to 6 days of having the disease.\nHow can you tell if influenza A or B is the cause?\nTo tell the difference between influenza viruses, you need to know what they are. Viruses are tiny particles that float around inside the cells. In order to be contagious, the virus must enter the cell. When the viruses enter this area, they multiply and move to other points in the area. Virus, such as hepatitis B and flu, reproduce by creating new viruses from its original source.\nThe influenza vaccine can only cure and treat type A influenza (or flu as it is known in some parts of the country.) Influenza B, however, is found in all parts, although it tends to infect more people in tropical climates. With this reason, it can never be eliminated.\nWhy you should have an influenza shot?\nThe flu shot you get will probably provide you with protection from both A and B viruses. If a flu vaccine includes both of these, a person with A is fully protected. And if the vaccination is only against one type, e.g. only influenza B virus, there is no guarantee that it will have any effect.\nThat said, if you find out that your family member has contracted influenza and that they have been vaccinated, consider getting an A shot. By doing so, your chances of becoming infected are greatly improved. You can do this by:\n* Keeping your hands clean and away from open wounds. * Avoiding close contact with your child whenever possible.\n* Taking part in activities that involve close physical contact, for example dancing, horseback riding and biking. Your risk of developing asthma goes down if your spouse has not been given an flu-shot and they do not work in an environmental that is dusty.\nFlu vaccines are made up of live components. Live components means there are viruses inside your body and some of"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6377, "rouge1_r": 0.2189, "rouge1_f1": 0.3259, "rouge2_p": 0.1606, "rouge2_r": 0.0549, "rouge2_f1": 0.0818, "rougel_p": 0.3188, "rougel_r": 0.1095, "rougel_f1": 0.163, "bleurt": 0.3634, "bert_score_p": 0.8232, "bert_score_r": 0.8583, "bert_score_f1": 0.8404, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5797, "rouge1_r": 0.1975, "rouge1_f1": 0.2947, "rouge2_p": 0.146, "rouge2_r": 0.0495, "rouge2_f1": 0.0739, "rougel_p": 0.2754, "rougel_r": 0.0938, "rougel_f1": 0.14, "bleurt": 0.3505, "bert_score_p": 0.8189, "bert_score_r": 0.8559, "bert_score_f1": 0.837, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.6014, "rouge1_r": 0.1939, "rouge1_f1": 0.2933, "rouge2_p": 0.1752, "rouge2_r": 0.0562, "rouge2_f1": 0.0851, "rougel_p": 0.2899, "rougel_r": 0.0935, "rougel_f1": 0.1413, "bleurt": 0.353, "bert_score_p": 0.8133, "bert_score_r": 0.8491, "bert_score_f1": 0.8308, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.6522, "rouge1_r": 0.2128, "rouge1_f1": 0.3209, "rouge2_p": 0.1314, "rouge2_r": 0.0427, "rouge2_f1": 0.0644, "rougel_p": 0.2754, "rougel_r": 0.0898, "rougel_f1": 0.1355, "bleurt": 0.3367, "bert_score_p": 0.8184, "bert_score_r": 0.8572, "bert_score_f1": 0.8374, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.2421, "rouge1_f1": 0.3262, "rouge2_p": 0.1387, "rouge2_r": 0.0669, "rouge2_f1": 0.0903, "rougel_p": 0.2536, "rougel_r": 0.1228, "rougel_f1": 0.1655, "bleurt": 0.3348, "bert_score_p": 0.8005, "bert_score_r": 0.8328, "bert_score_f1": 0.8164, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5217, "rouge1_r": 0.1682, "rouge1_f1": 0.2544, "rouge2_p": 0.0803, "rouge2_r": 0.0258, "rouge2_f1": 0.039, "rougel_p": 0.2391, "rougel_r": 0.0771, "rougel_f1": 0.1166, "bleurt": 0.3512, "bert_score_p": 0.8126, "bert_score_r": 0.8381, "bert_score_f1": 0.8252, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

They are used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. Ibprofens work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that cause pain and swelling. Tylenols are also a NSAID, but they work differently than ibprofen. They work to reduce fever and pain by reducing the amount of chemicals in the body that make you feel hot or cold. So, while both ibprofen and tyloenol are NSAIDs, they have different mechanisms of action.\nWhat is the difference between ibupropen and Tylox?\nIbuprophen is a nonsteroid antiinflammatory drug that is used for the treatment of pain. It is also used as a fever reducer. The main difference is that iboprofen is not a steroid. Steroids are hormones that are produced by the adrenal glands. These hormones help to regulate the immune system and other body functions. When you take a drug like ibopropfen, it blocks the action of these hormones. This can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma, death. If you have any of the above symptoms, you should stop taking iboprufen immediately and call your doctor.\nIs Tylophen the same as ibu?\nTylophens and ibus are two different types of drugs. Ibus are anti-inflammatories, whereas tylos are pain relievers. Both drugs are available over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription. However, there are some differences between them. For example, ibuses are usually taken orally, tyloses are applied topically. Also, the dosage of ibuse is higher than that of tylol. In addition, tyles are more effective than ibruses in treating pain.\nHow do you spell Tylosin?\nThe word \u201ctylos\u201d is derived from the Greek word for \u201ctooth\u201d. It refers to the tooth of a horse. A horse\u2019s teeth are called \u201cteeth\u201d because they are shaped like a tooth. Horses have four teeth in each jaw. Each tooth has two roots. One root is called the \u201croot of life\u201d and the other is known as the root of death.\nDoes Tylose have ibrophen?\nYes, Tyloses do contain", "3\nHow many types of Tylenols are there? TyLenol is a family of over-the-counter medications designed primarily for the relief of pain and fever. The medicines in this family have the general name paracetamol, which is also called acetylsalicylic acid. Tylon is made by the company Merck and Co., Inc.\nDo tylerols have ibupropfen?\nIbuprofin is an excellent OTC pain product that is sold under the brand name Tyelenol. It is most often used to treat headaches, minor aches and pains and menstrual discomfort. Ibuprofens work on the nervous system by releasing prostaglandins into the bloodstream, thus causing the brain to increase its blood flow to the organs. This can be helpful during menstruation since the pain of a cramping uterus is caused by increased prostglandin levels.\nWhen to take tyelol capsules?\nTylenolate is indicated for use in all individuals over two years of age for treating mild to moderate pain or fever associated with dental surgery, tooth extraction, or dental restorations. Do not exceed three 650 mg capsules in 24 hours.\nWhat does Tyelols do for tooth sensitivity?\nYour dentist may prescribe Tylofen for some types to relieve tooth or jaw pain after a root canal or crown procedure. But since its main effect is to numb the mouth, other drugs like ibupertin might work better. Both of these medicines contain salicylates, so keep them separate.\nIs Tyelo or tylofren stronger?\nIt really comes down to whether one drug works better for you on your own. And in the same way that iburopin is more effective than tyelonate because it contains much more pain relievers (aspirin) than the latter, ibuperfen is better than tolophene because the ratio is the other way around.\nCan I take 6 Tyelonol PM at night?\nTake this medicine exactly as directed. Your doctor will probably give you 400 to 600 mg before bedtime. If it does not work, tell your doctor how much time you need to rest for 2 to -1.5 hours before you go to bed.\nHow much Tyleoline do you give a cat?\nTyleoline is another non-prescription medication typically used for cats and dogs that have mild pain.

In fact, the most common reason for laceration of the skin is infection due to a boil, cyst, or other absessed area. Some patients report no symptoms with absesses--these are usually small absessions. Absesses can lead to fistulas as well--I assume this term is new to you. This is an abnormal tract that extends from the absess through the dermal layer of skin. The fistula may extend into any surrounding structures, including the muscle and other organs.\nAfter mastectomy, there is a risk of abscession, especially in the postmastectomy patients who receive radiation treatments. These can occur even 3-8 years after surgery and can even occur near the incision site. If the tissue, which is the mastectomized breast, is not cleaned appropriately after the surgery, bacteria can grow and cause absccesses. Postoperative infections of this type typically require hospital-based care.\nAbout a third of all breast cancers may spread to the axilla--the area under the arm. Axillary node dissection is commonly performed to prevent and assess metastasis (spread and development of other cancer sites). Lymph nodes may harbor cancer and these are normally removed and analyzed after disectomy. Typically, after node removal, patients can experience numbness and tingling sensations due the fact that sensory nerves are located in this region. After the lymph nodes are removed, lymph fluids must still flow through. Therefore the remaining nodes must bear a proportionally greater burden of fluid. Over time, this can result in some swelling.\nMore Questions?

Can I just have antibiotics with out draining it out?", "Answer From Brent\u00a0W.\u00a0Randall,\u00a0MD\nAn absess with out pain could be because it is underdeveloped and is not causing symptoms because there is no pus to press against the skin causing pain nor is there enough infection to cause swelling or redness. Pain is an inflammatory response to infection that we have evolved to seek attention to because left untreated it can be serious and even life threatening. Thus the evolution of the pain mechanism. Pus without pain is common, usually as an early sign of an infection and a signal to take action before the infection worsens.\u00a0\nPain is the sensation of feeling discomfort, either emotional or physical.\nThe causes of pain are either local, where the injury is near the spot that hurts, or central where nerve fibers in the spinal cord misfire.\nA person with a severe infection may only show signs of weakness, fever, chills, sweating, and loss of appetite instead of obvious pain.\nLearn more about the Causes of Pain \u00bb\nInfections occur when the defenses in a body are broken and pathogens invade to make copies of themselves and spread.\nWhen an immune cell, such as a white blood cell or macrophage (a large phagocyte), encounters pathogens, they activate and release chemicals to alert and recruit other immune cells to the infected area, thus creating a local response.\nSometimes when an infected host cell is killed it releases chemicals from inside of it that can cause pain for up to two weeks.\nInflammation can take many forms including: red, puffy, swollen, hot, edematous, tender, painful, hard, soft, indurated, lumpy, itchy, blistery.\nTenderness may or may not occur as well, though, if present, is often felt as soreness, sensitivity, throbbing, tingling, pressure, tightness or deep sore spots.\nPus is a thick yellow-grey fluid that contains a mixture of dead tissue, bacteria, white cells, proteins, dead cells and may also contain a few living bacteria.\nBacteria within absesses continue to secrete substances that may cause a variety of symptoms such pneumonia, which is caused by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus bacteria that seep into the lungs via the bronchial tubes.\nLumps can indicate an accumulation of fluid or gas.\nCyst may be benign or cancerous and are a sac-like fluid-filled cavity made of thickened tissue in which one or more"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5455, "rouge1_r": 0.1825, "rouge1_f1": 0.2735, "rouge2_p": 0.1494, "rouge2_r": 0.0496, "rouge2_f1": 0.0745, "rougel_p": 0.2727, "rougel_r": 0.0913, "rougel_f1": 0.1368, "bleurt": 0.3309, "bert_score_p": 0.8345, "bert_score_r": 0.8772, "bert_score_f1": 0.8553, "hallucination": 57.14285714285714, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5341, "rouge1_r": 0.1531, "rouge1_f1": 0.238, "rouge2_p": 0.069, "rouge2_r": 0.0196, "rouge2_f1": 0.0305, "rougel_p": 0.2045, "rougel_r": 0.0586, "rougel_f1": 0.0911, "bleurt": 0.3024, "bert_score_p": 0.8115, "bert_score_r": 0.8653, "bert_score_f1": 0.8375, "hallucination": 57.14285714285714, "comprehensive": 25.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.2955, "rouge1_r": 0.2921, "rouge1_f1": 0.2938, "rouge2_p": 0.023, "rouge2_r": 0.0227, "rouge2_f1": 0.0229, "rougel_p": 0.1477, "rougel_r": 0.1461, "rougel_f1": 0.1469, "bleurt": 0.2651, "bert_score_p": 0.8389, "bert_score_r": 0.8471, "bert_score_f1": 0.843, "hallucination": 85.71428571428571, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.2841, "rouge1_r": 0.2907, "rouge1_f1": 0.2874, "rouge2_p": 0.023, "rouge2_r": 0.0235, "rouge2_f1": 0.0233, "rougel_p": 0.1591, "rougel_r": 0.1628, "rougel_f1": 0.1609, "bleurt": 0.2806, "bert_score_p": 0.8516, "bert_score_r": 0.8613, "bert_score_f1": 0.8564, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.1023, "rouge1_r": 0.2195, "rouge1_f1": 0.1395, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0682, "rougel_r": 0.1463, "rougel_f1": 0.093, "bleurt": 0.1924, "bert_score_p": 0.8411, "bert_score_r": 0.8271, "bert_score_f1": 0.834, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4886, "rouge1_r": 0.1114, "rouge1_f1": 0.1814, "rouge2_p": 0.1264, "rouge2_r": 0.0286, "rouge2_f1": 0.0466, "rougel_p": 0.25, "rougel_r": 0.057, "rougel_f1": 0.0928, "bleurt": 0.2845, "bert_score_p": 0.7946, "bert_score_r": 0.8546, "bert_score_f1": 0.8235, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

Is flex a larger joint than ext?\nTendon healing and function in humans and other animals are not perfectly understood. We do have quite a lot of clinical experience though and from my own experience, tendon healing is pretty predictable. Once a tendon has gone, it's pretty much a write-off from then on.\nAs to your other questions on tenderness and spraining; while it is possible for a flexed muscle to tear, there are some mechanical reasons why it might heal better. The muscle bellies of an extender and flexer are the same but they are on different levels and as such, are often in different planes. This means that there will be a varying amount of stress depending on level, position, etc. Also, the level at which the tendos attaches to bone may influence mechanics. At one end, you have the extension tendon as a part of a cable (it pulls the fingers backwards), while a wrist flexors tendon is only a small part (the end part that attaches) - thus more vulnerable to some injury.\nAll of these injuries are more common from work than spraints. Work in this area will lead to tendon degeneration and tendinopathies that eventually lead on to rupture or tendon dislocation. Sprains themselves are quite rare. More common is tendon tendovigosis; an irritation in and around the sheath of synovial tissue that leads to fluid accumulation there. It's a result of tendon irritation - not inflammation. Inflammation", "Why is it so? Should there even be pain in flexion, given that we get more blood flow and healing in the flexed position?\nTendinities is a very general label for a common condition. It can include pain anywhere on a tendon (the connection between a muscle, or group of muscles and its' attachment point), its\u2019 connective tissue coverings or the tendon itself. This, like all musculoskeletal health issues, can be exacerbated by improper mechanics. A tendon, although considered a fibrous (not \u2018living\u2019 tissue), is very responsive to stressors and changes. As it goes through a life cycle of use, degeneration and rest, the body will remodel the tissues to adapt.\nIn the context you are describing, this can manifest as one or both of the following:\n  1. Changes in tissue quality (such as the degenerative or inflamed state)\n  *This can often feel tight, uncomfortable or even painful\n 2. Muscles with poor postural quality and/or strength, which can lead to compensation that creates imbalances throughout the kinetic chain. In order to resolve this, we must work in a systematic fashion to address imbalanced force\n *Example: a weak and lengthened pectoralis minor that has a compensatory shortened tightness in its antagonist- serratus anterior at the side, would create inefficient movement at one end of its length\nIf you\u2019d like someone to look at your body and address these areas for overall balance and efficiency around the shoulder joint, send us an email or book a session through our website- www.theuniversebody.com. \n#shoulderpain #tendonconditioning #orthopedic #physiotherapy #physicaltherapist\nIs a \u2018bigger\u2019 bicep \u2018better\u2019?

I also have been eating as little as possible as it makes me sick because of the inflammation.\nYes. This could be the reason for constipation. In the initial phase of an abdominal illness, you may experience stomach pain. Pain from the large intestine is more intense and severe when you're in an affected area. The pain in your upper abdomen is caused by food passing through your bowels. As the bowel moves and pressure is put on the intestinally lining, it may cause discomfort. A stomach infection, called a flu virus, is very dangerous, but if you get it, the pain may be even worse. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor for immediate assistance. You might also need to call an ambulance, because if the symptoms show up quickly, this is a medical emergency.\nThis can be caused through infection and/or eating too much fatty foods. Avoid fat in foods, eat less of it and cut foods out of your diet that are high in fat or bad for your system, such as processed foods etc. Try to find a good diet program that has the right balance of nutrients, minerals and vitamins to help your body in times of stress such that of stomach cramp and pain.\nTry mixing the milk and apple cider vinegar.\nIt will get rid of any bacteria you might have.

I am a RN but cannot find a published article that states pancreatic enzymes are related and I have only found anecdotal stories with no substantiating articles to refer to physicians I know that are not familiar with this association. Can anyone help me out on this.\nIt sounds like your mother had pancreatic ductal adenomaoma (PDAC), or pancreatic carcinoma (PC), which is the most common malignancy of the pancreas and is associated with more than 95% of all exocrine pancreatic cancers in the United States. PC generally presents with pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Other signs and symptoms include diabetes mellitus, fatty bowel movements, abdominal discomfort, fever, chills, pale skin, dizziness or fainting, bone pain or fractures, nausea, constipation, or vomiting. Risk factors of PC development include cigarette smoking, chronic alcohol use, occupational exposure to industrial materials, inflammation of pancreases, recurrent pancreatits episodes, diabetes onset, genetic familial predisposition, advanced age (approximately 80% occur after 65 years), and sex [the incidence of PDAC is 2.5 to 3 times higher in men than in women].\nPC is usually not curable, depending on the stage at which the disease is diagnosed; thus, prompt and effective therapeutics against PC are desperately needed. However, in recent years, researchers have focused their endeavors upon understanding the progression of certain tumors. Specifically, it has been found that tumors are composed of cancer stem-like cells and of highly proliferated cells that express high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ALDH is known to metabolize exogenous and endogenous toxic aldehydes, which causes the cancer drug, cyclophosphamide, to be more potent in killing cancer cells. Thus, inhibiting ALD is important for the proliferation and survival of both hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and cancer-initiating cells [CICs] (Albino et al., 2006). Thus far, two classes of ALDA inhibitors have been reported: i) 4", "What is its role and function in the body and how does it cause chronic Pancreatitis.

Should i be concerned?\nThere is no reason to be worried by this data. An MRI is useful to explore the abdomen, but a CT is necessary to define a pancreatisis and, with certainty, exclude any cause of pain.

Some of her friends and family say, she should have her lipases done. I want to understand the test and its indications and if its the correct test for this problem. Is low lipes related only to pancreas problems. Does it mean only pancreatis or can it also mean cancer, and even so does the cancer have to be located in pancreat if the lipse level is not normal. Also for people with chronic pancreatic disease, i don't understand why there is no cure for such a common and deadly illness and why if there are drugs or supplements to help treat them, they aren't prescribed at the initial stage of the disease. We hear about various treatments on television, but when we go to the doctor or a specialist is hardly if ever recommend them and all we are given is antibiotics and a pain killer like metoclopramide. So we have been trying to treat ourselves. What do you think. Should the docotor have recommended these and what else would you recommend. Thanks for your assitance.\nLipase is an enzyme made in a specific type of cell in pancreatic. If lipas levels are low it can be a sign of inflammation or atrophy of pancreaitis. Inflammation can come from viral or bacterial infection or from various causes such as alcohol, or obstruction of pancreatic ducts. Low lipese can also be seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). So, there can bee many types of etiology for low or reduced lipae but in your wife's case based on your description it is likeer to come fom pancretis.\nYou are refering to treatment. There is much controversy with regard to best treatment for pancreatic disorders. As I have told you before, best approach is to go for resection which is total excision of disease with very little chance of recurrence. It is a very big operation but as it reduces the volume of diseased tissue significantly (by 90%), it has least chance for relapse. But pancreatic excisions have high morbidity and high moality specially in developing countries like ours. Another option is removal of tumor only or tumor and some tissue surrounding it. This is called partial re section and is less morbid and moal but can still cause recurrence and require further treatment.\nAnother mod"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1212, "rouge1_r": 0.32, "rouge1_f1": 0.1758, "rouge2_p": 0.0308, "rouge2_r": 0.0833, "rouge2_f1": 0.0449, "rougel_p": 0.0909, "rougel_r": 0.24, "rougel_f1": 0.1319, "bleurt": 0.2395, "bert_score_p": 0.8686, "bert_score_r": 0.8504, "bert_score_f1": 0.8594, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 20.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.1162, "rouge1_f1": 0.1886, "rouge2_p": 0.0615, "rouge2_r": 0.0141, "rouge2_f1": 0.023, "rougel_p": 0.2273, "rougel_r": 0.0528, "rougel_f1": 0.0857, "bleurt": 0.254, "bert_score_p": 0.8046, "bert_score_r": 0.8566, "bert_score_f1": 0.8298, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 40.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4394, "rouge1_r": 0.0736, "rouge1_f1": 0.1261, "rouge2_p": 0.0154, "rouge2_r": 0.0025, "rouge2_f1": 0.0044, "rougel_p": 0.2121, "rougel_r": 0.0355, "rougel_f1": 0.0609, "bleurt": 0.2317, "bert_score_p": 0.7859, "bert_score_r": 0.8429, "bert_score_f1": 0.8134, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 60.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4394, "rouge1_r": 0.0843, "rouge1_f1": 0.1415, "rouge2_p": 0.0615, "rouge2_r": 0.0117, "rouge2_f1": 0.0196, "rougel_p": 0.2273, "rougel_r": 0.0436, "rougel_f1": 0.0732, "bleurt": 0.2759, "bert_score_p": 0.7809, "bert_score_r": 0.8455, "bert_score_f1": 0.8119, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 40.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5152, "rouge1_r": 0.0867, "rouge1_f1": 0.1485, "rouge2_p": 0.1231, "rouge2_r": 0.0205, "rouge2_f1": 0.0351, "rougel_p": 0.2424, "rougel_r": 0.0408, "rougel_f1": 0.0699, "bleurt": 0.3045, "bert_score_p": 0.7935, "bert_score_r": 0.8573, "bert_score_f1": 0.8241, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 80.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5909, "rouge1_r": 0.0951, "rouge1_f1": 0.1639, "rouge2_p": 0.0462, "rouge2_r": 0.0073, "rouge2_f1": 0.0127, "rougel_p": 0.2879, "rougel_r": 0.0463, "rougel_f1": 0.0798, "bleurt": 0.2921, "bert_score_p": 0.7946, "bert_score_r": 0.8589, "bert_score_f1": 0.8255, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 80.0}]}

In any case, it is important to note that these two molecules aren\u2019t directly related to one another, and it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that they are.\nFirst let us discuss the relationship between peptylis and peptides. Peptides are natural chemical substances produced by bacteria and have been used for years in medical treatments. These days, the demand for peplets has increased due to the fact that a wide range of pharmaceutical preparations are now available in stores around the world. The reason for this increased demand is that manufacturers are finding it difficult to produce pepletic materials which are strong and effective in treating infections. By comparison, peplos are produced with more organic materials that don\u2019t interfere much with the immune system, making them perfect for treating various types of illness.\nThere are several reasons why pepets are often associated with a number of conditions. One such reason is because they tend to be stronger than similar alternatives such as antibiotics, steroids, antipyretics and anti-cold medications. When these supplements are used, they can reduce inflammation in muscle tissue as well as help increase blood flow throughout the body, which makes it easier for the affected area to heal quicker. This is the main reason why many people prefer peplin over other treatments.\nIn order to properly treat an infection, many physicians suggest that their patients consider using pepts.

Sometimes the root of the problem lies with your own body. If you think you are dealing with something that is related solely to a lack of peptoms, you should consult with an expert.

{"Question": "Is poison ivy contagious between people?", "Free_form_answer": "Poison Ivy is a plant that, when in direct contact with the skin, can cause a skin reaction called \"contact dermatitis\". This rash is not contagious and cannot be transferred between people. However, it is possible to develop the rash by touching objects that have been in contact with the plant's oil, such as clothes, tools, or animal fur. Additionally, being in the vicinity of burning poison ivy can also cause contact dermatitis. It's worth noting that the same substance causing the rash in poison ivy can also be found in other plants like poison oak, poison sumac, ginkgo fruit, and mango peels.", "Must_have": ["Poison ivy causes contact dermatitis through direct contact with the plant", "It is rare but possible to develop contact dermatitis from poison ivy by touching objects with the plant's oil on them", " the rash caused by poison ivy is not contagious and cannot be transferred between people."], "Nice_to_have": ["Contact dermatitis from poison ivy can be caused by being in the vicinity of burning poison ivy", "The substance causing the rash in poison ivy is also found in poison oak", "The substance causing the rash in poison ivy is also found in poison sumac", "The substance causing the rash in poison ivy is also found in ginkgo fruit", "The substance causing the rash in poison ivy is also found in mango peel"], "Sources": "https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/outsmarting-poison-ivy-and-other-poisonous-plants\n https://www-uptodate-com.meir.idm.oclc.org/contents/poison-ivy-beyond-the-basics?search=poison%20ivy&topicRef=15494&source=see_link", "ICD_10_diag": "Irritant contact dermatitis due to plants, except food", "sample_predictions": ["Poison ivu is a skin rash caused by an allergic reaction to urushiol, an oily resin found in the leaves, stems, and roots of poison oak, poison sumac, or poison. Poison Ivy is not contagious. It is caused when you come into contact with the oil from the plant. The oil can be on the skin, clothing, tools, pets, etc. If you touch the poison oil and then touch your skin or mucous membranes, you can get a rash. You can also get the rash if you breathe in smoke from burning poison plants.", "Well, we have to know first what it means by \u201ccontagious.\u201d In our opinion, two things may make it \u201ccatchy\u201d that is, if one man is infected, he might be infectious to others.\nThe first thing is the fluid that contains the urushiol (the poisonous substance of poison oak and poison.ivy.) can transfer from a contaminated person to another. This can be done physically, like by sharing the clothes of the affected person or sharing personal items such as blankets and towels. So, it is contagious through the transfer of fluids. Urushio can even survive if you eat it.\nSecond, the oil is also contagious in a literal sense. As urusio is persistent on the site of contact it may last for months which may lead others to be infected through contact with it. Thus, for the first 4 weeks, you must avoid contact until the rash completely disappears. Then, urushi may still be retained on your body and objects you touched so to make sure you will not be the origin of infection do not touch other people. In other occasions it can spread to pets.\nFor more information about the treatment or if this site is useful for you please visit my blog Poison Oak Treatment and Poison Iv Treatment.\nIs there a way to cure this?\nDo we really need a Cure?", "It is a myth as it cannot be transmitted by touching a person. Instead, it is usually transmitted on the body of an exposed person through physical contact with the plant itself and not between two people.\nHow long does poison Ivy live on a surface? How Long Does Poison Ivy Stays Contagious on Surfaces. The oil on toxic urushiol which makes contact on to a contaminated surface is able to last up to one year in most of the circumstances if left unchecked. If the oil is exposed to the air, its longevity is considerably reduced.\nDoes poison oak spread easily from person to person? Poison ivya may not necessarily spread from one person\u2019s body to another. However, the toxic oil that causes a rash is in the resin and on all parts of poison-ivy plant\u2014roots, stems, leaves, and berries.\nCan you get poison from touching someone else? The main culprit is urushiols, which are the toxins in poison plant and a clear liquid in urine, feces, blood, sweat, spit, tears, genital secretions, breast milk, semen, saliva, etc. So, touching or kissing a human being can directly cause poison to spread between each other.\nIs Poison Oak contagious from human to human? Is poison oaks (urushol oild) contagious in any shape or form?\nIs urusiol toxic to humans?\nUrusiol is the active chemical in a poison that creates a painful rash \u2014 not only on exposed skin, but also wherever you\u2019ve touched it on your body, including the face, nose and mouth and even inside your eyes, lips or other body orifices.\nWhat happens if you eat poison leaf?\nLeafy greens and other vegetables are healthy and filling. A small amount of a toxic chemical such as poison hemlock won\u2019t cause much harm. But if children eat lots of plant parts with poison, or if an adult eats a large quantity, there may be toxic effects and death. Poisonous weeds such a Death Camas (Zigadenus)\nWhat do poison plants look like?\nPoison plants are easy to identify if they can be seen. Some plants have a bad smell that is not normal. Other plants, such are Deathcamas or Spurge look similar to other good plants. In addition, some plants can look totally different depending upon the time of year.\nDo poison leaves expire?\nIn some cases, yes, they will deteriorate or die if not kept in water. Succulents from the c", "Not directly!\nThe oil in poison oak, poison sumac, and poison Ivy - called urushiol - is what causes the rash. The oils are so potent that simply touching them with something like a leaf or stem can cause a rash on the skin of the area they are transferred to. Urusholi transfers easily (for example, simply inhaling the oil of a plant is enough to cause it), is resistant to some cleaners, water and solvents, but can be removed with turpentine or rubbing alcohol.\nUrushol remains potent for several years on plants or objects it comes in contact with, so if you brush against something treated with urusol and do not wash, you may get poison plants for weeks or months afterward. Even wood treated to make a good barbecue grill can contain uruhol years later and cause severe rashes if handled without protection.\nOnce on your skin, the urushiols in these plants are extremely contagious. If you wash immediately, any residue you leave, even on clothing or equipment that is rinsed and left to air dry can transfer the residue to someone else or simply retain enough urusiols to transfer them again to yourself.\nRinsing your hands for 5-20 minutes in a stream of water is the recommended immediate treatment after contact. There is even evidence that cold rinses may decrease the potency of urusoil. You should still avoid scratching the affected area once it is rashed. Scratching or picking will increase irritation, inflammation, sensitivity, itch, pain and risk of infection.", "(Poison ivies, oak, and sumac are allergens that cause most cases of allergic reactions to plants.) The oil in the leaves and stems of these plants causes itchy, blistering rashes, called contact dermatitis. You can contract these rans without touching the plants themselves. However, these rash-causing toxins live in most people's bodies, although there may be as few as 30% among whites, 80% of Hispanic peoples, but a staggering 90% in American Indian/Alaskan native populations. The reason for these differences is likely due to genetics, or possibly environmental conditioning.\nSymptoms of Poison Ivy/ Oak/ Sumac\nYou know the phrase \"leaves of three, let them be!\" The leaves of poison oak (one form of which grows as a woody shrub,) the poisonous ivanovitch, poison sumach, even poison buck. For 60% it's the skin (itchy, scaly ripples, blisters, red skin), for 40% is systemic (internal organ symptoms).\nI would think that not touching something contaminated by poison, like poison from the plant, would be something to know about. Ingestion and injection are both potential risks of toxins in plants. A rash is not contagious, as far as I know. Contact dermatits are generally caused by irritants on the person who is allergic, such as plants, dander, dust, pollen, etc. Touching a contaminated place, touching a person's skin, ingesting the toxicant through contaminated food or drink (ie water), or breathing in contaminated air (by being too close to an animal) are possible vectors of transmission of harmful substances, whether or not one gets a rash. If you are worried about getting rhabdomyolysis (toxic build up in muscles) or the liver or brain, the best way to protect yourself in case of a poisoning is simply to NOT expose yourself to poison in general, if you can avoid it: don't touch it, don know, stay away from plants or animals that might be poisonous (for example, a snake). If one's spouse is having a miscarriage, one should not contact with their exposed blood, tissues or liquids. This exposure can cause a pregnancy or miscarriadge to be exposed. And last but not least, there are many plants that are poisonous. It is always better to ask someone who knows what he or she is talking about about the risks", "No, poison oak or poison sums up its effects. The poison you have does not pass to another person by physical contact. However, if contact is made between your body and soil, another individual can become infected. It will create dermatitis and a skin rash on the infected body. This poison has a very powerful and painful effect. If you get in touch with that plant, the rashes will occur within 36 hours on your feet or hands. So it is not contagious from person to person but it can be through infected soil or contaminated items like clothes etc.\nYou can get affected by the poison of the affected person, but we can say as non-contagious as we cannot identify it. There are various ways that we use to remove poison so we should know all about them. Here we try to answer some basic queries like what is poison, how it affects, and what remedy can we get rid of it.\nWhat is Poison?\nPoison is a harmful chemical solution that can harm the living body in various forms. Poison can affect the human body by oral, ocular, topical consumption, or contact.\nPoisons are inorganic or organic compounds. Inorganic poisons can have effects like metal poisoning in the body, whereas organic poison has an effect of plant or animal form on our body.\nTypes of Poison Effects\nThe main two types of poising effects in our bodies are\nAcute Poisoning:\nAcutely poisoning effect on a body occurs in a short span. That means in some minutes, it will start showing the effect and in less than 3 hours, its symptoms show.\u00a0\nChronic Poisin Effect:\nCholesterolic effect occurs slowly in weeks, months, years, even for long duration. Slowly that toxin will spread with our fluids and show its adverse effects.\nIs Poison Contagiosus?\nNow the answer can you catch poison from the person in any way? We should understand that poison is an inanimate object or living object. We are not able to pass poisonous living or dead objects from one to one. You can touch their clothes and catch it but this will not happen to you. Only the object you touch can make them infected and that is how they get the infection and produce the toxic effect.\nHow to Avoid Poison\nWe can not avoid the toxins that are present in nature. But we always come in contact when we are outside our house or do anything.

As a potential GLPG1 antagonist. While there have been attempts to design analogues containing a single site of phosphorylation, such compounds are much more difficult to synthesize from natural sources.\nIs there a \"saxenda\" alternative? Or a substitute to use in combination with a low-calorie diet?\nI had my T", "No. What is saxendas mechanism of action\nSaxenda works in a similar way as GLP-1 medicines. It mimics the effects of natural GLB-14, a gut hormone that supports weight loss. In contrast to GLSB-15, Saxenda induces weight gain. Saxendas effect in helping people lose weight is due to the activation of GLPS-2 receptors. Therefore, this drug also has GLp-12 agonist effects. However many Saxendah users do not use it for its GLpb-5 modulatory effects, they simply use Saxendo as a hunger suppressant. A common complaint from users of Saxena is that they cannot eat a lot during the day. This makes them less hungry and allows them to eat less at mealtimes. Unfortunately, when they get hungry again, the feelings last only until they eat something at mealtime. After a meal, however, their appetite returns. Another problem that is affecting people using Saxenso is the nausea associated with its use. Some people feel nauseated soon after taking Saxenae. The nausea is usually short-lived but it can be long-lasting if the person takes the drug too often.\nWhat\u2019s better phenobarbital or l-thyroxine?\nL-thyroine is a synthetic and natural form of the active ingredient in phenobralic acid (PMA). The primary difference is in how quickly it is metabolized. L-thyrine, also known as S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMI), is used to treat several thyroid conditions, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidisim. When you compare SAMI to natural thyroid, one difference becomes apparent: its duration of activity is shorter than that of phenoprobital and is also much lower. SAMIs effect is seen within a day while that with PMA is within one to two days. Thus, SAMIS action on the thyroid is not as fast and effective as that for phenytoin or phenylpropanolamine, two popular anti-epilepsy drugstudies have found. As an anti-hyperthyromegaly drug, pheyrophenamine is much less effective than thyrothiazan, which is effective against hyperhyroidim and prevents hyperparathyroid. So what is better, phenybrotol or pneyropropane?\nDoes phenothiazine induce cyp 2c19? Do any antips", "Because I can't imagine a \"hypothetically\" insulin dependent like 2 could be released. Could it? It looks to me like they are doing insulin and GLP-1 a disservice. I just came to that conclusion in the past year, and now they're adding more drugs for the GLp-2 or maybe not and maybe this is why they aren't going to do it.\nThis drug (semaglutide) has been so effective with such low side effects for me. The side effect that was concerning me was what will my body do. Maybe it will not do the other drug.\nAs far as the diabetes is concerned, yes, that would reduce insulin release or at least it would have to.\nCan you tell me your experience? Did you notice a loss of appetite and/or change of bowel regularity?\nI noticed just an overall slight change in my satiety level. Like my appetite went from 8 to 4. My bowel movement, in retrospect, I would guess that it did get more regular. But, at first, it really didn\u2019t seem like that, more like just a bowel control thing more than a rhythm change.\nThe way I see it, is, if you are Type 1 or type 3, meaning you need to get your insulin from insulin pumps or you don\u2019t want to eat to feel good, then, to some extent this drug may change that. It may not be the same if your body is releasing insulin because the drug is making you eat less or have less appetite, or making your brain do whatever it is it does that makes you have an appetite.\nTo me it could make sense in those kind of situations. That\u2019s all.\nI\u2019ve heard that some people that were getting this in a clinical trial were not taking daily insulin but were using another one for \u201cjust in case\u201d. Maybe not every time but some just in hopes that maybe no insulin would be needed during the day.", "How exactly does it work in the body and how does this affect people at risk of diabetes?\u00a0\nI'm going to assume you meant semaglutide as saxena is the drug name. While Saxenda is a GLP-1 analogue, or a synthetic form of GLA- 1, it does not work as a 'blocker'. It is an agonist that stimulates receptors in your gut that control how your body uses foods for energy.\u00a0\nThe drugs are being increasingly used to help control the symptoms of patients with diabetes, and can lead to weight loss.\nWhile semeglutlide works on the same hormone pathway that naturally occurs in type 2 diabetic patients at lower doses, it's effectiveness for weight manegement requires a higher dose, increasing the activity (or the potency) of the hormone.\nSaxenda uses the naturally occuring GLS-4 hormones, but they are made synthetically to mimic your bodies GL-PA pathway's effect and it is thought that higher doses of them will control appetite, increase metabolism and lower hunger.\u00a0\nSxenda has been approved in Canada as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the manageent of obesity with a body mass index of 30kg/m^2 or higher (obese) or overweight (body mass indices 27-29.9) and risk factors (high LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, etc).\nAs Dr. Mark Hinkle and many other health professionals have highlighted, a healthy diet low in sugar and salt, regular exercise, smoking cessation, reduced alcohol consumption, maintaining a regular sleep schedule are all important to overall good health and preventing weight gain and diabetes. As always, if you have an abnormal change in weight - speak with you primary care physician (GP).\nIs there any evidence showing\u00a0how this has an effect on\u00a0diabetes and the risk for diabetics? And can a person who is not diabetic take this or will they be worse off in taking this? Thank you.\nI haven't come across any scientific information showing the efficacy of semglatide for people with type II diabates. But as previously mentioned, the goal weight in patients of this drug is 5% - 10% of your weight. So when you are losing weight, your blood sugars will go lower and be better controlled. In addition, some studies have shown that it can slow the progression of type2 diabetes (1). It's very important that you consult with your primary physician before", "- Weight Loss - MedHelp\nIs Saxenda similar to Victoza? Saxendais an FDA-approved weight-loss drug derived from the GLP-1 agonist Victozamade of Liraglutidewhile Semaglutilide is a GLPT receptor agonistsold for the treatment of congestive heart failure, which causes the body to pump less efficiently. As an oral medication, semagatilutide cannot achieve levels that would affect appetite and food intake.\nSemaglatilide must be injected. The drug also comes with potentially serious side effects such as gall bladder disease, pancreatitis, heart problems, and low blood sugar in Type 2 diabetics. It also has not been tested in pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nAnd like all GLT-agonist drugs, Semagitlutide can also stimulate the growth of insulin producing islets in the pancreas. And it can be expensive as some private insurers aren't covering the drug, according to one article on Stat Newswhich might reduce its use especially if the health care cost increases with less weight loss.\nThe bottom line: Sematutlide should only be used when other weight reduction measures have failed. GLPs belong to a class of drugs called incretin mimetics.\nWhy might I be on a medication that stimulates the release of the same incretein that I produce, anyway?\nLike most other obesity drugsincluding Victaza, Saxena, Contrave, Belvidia and Lorcaserinothese drugs have never been subjected to long term studies. Obesity, in general, requires a life-long commitment to behavioral modification, diet compliance and exercise. Weight-loss drugs rarely have a dramatic effect on your weight. They usually help when there is something else going on like a genetic disease or hormone imbalancebut even if they do have some effects, the effects can't be sustained without lifestyle changes, as evidenced by the fact that people generally regain their weight if those lifestyle habits aren' t adopted.

The most common cause of anal Fissures are constipation. For this reason, laxatives and stool softeners are a part of every treatment program. Other common causes are diarrhea, inflammatory bowel conditions, and anal intercourse.\nAnal FISSURES ARE OPEN SORES\nAlthough anal fisses are open wounds, that is not the worst part. If left untreated, the deeper the wound becomes, then there will be bleeding and the chances of scarring will also increase. A few common symptoms of these fissurers are bleeding during the bowel movements, pain during a bowel movement, increased pain in the rectal area, itching, swelling that can lead to fever and diarrhea. These symptoms are the result of the injury itself and not an associated disease. While these minor wounds are not serious, it is best to avoid the temptation of trying to heal these wounds by yourself. When treated medically, anal wounds heal quicker and with less pain.\u00a0\nMEDICAL TREATMENTS OF ANAL FISSESURS\nWhen consulting a doctor for your problem, he/she will try to find out the cause and then create a suitable plan. Before proceeding with any treatment or operation, your doctor will confirm if you are healthy enough to tolerate surgery. Since the area involved is the gastrointestinal tract, a few pre and post-operation tests need to be performed. Injections into the anal canal and sedation are also done in some cases.\nThe most effective way to reduce pain is to apply a topical cream. You can also use a medicated suppository if a fissute is giving you constant pain, this can be effective with or without surgery in reducing the pain.\nSURGERY FOR ANAL WOUNDS\nIn some severe cases a lacerated wound cannot heal properly. This is because the edges of this wound may have separated too many times. Because these edges are separated by the muscles of your anus and thus they need more time to join permanently (this also depends on your age and health). The doctor may also suggest a laser for these types of wounds. After the operation (whether laser or surgery), there may be temporary discomfort. But that will end in a couple of days.

It could be that you are drinking too much water, which can cause your body to flush out excess water through your kidneys. This is called diuresis. Another possibility is that your diet is high in protein, sodium, or caffeine, all of which increase urine output. Finally, it could simply be a sign of dehydration. If you're not sure what's causing your clear urine, talk to your doctor. They can help you figure out the cause and determine whether or not you need to make any changes to how much fluid you drink.\nThere is no one answer to this question as the color of urine can vary depending on a number of factors, including diet, hydration, and health. However, if you have noticed that yours is consistently clear, there could potentially be an underlying issue. For example, dehydration can lead to clear or pale urine. Additionally, certain medications or supplements can also cause this change in color. Therefore, we recommend consulting with a healthcare professional if this is a concern for you.\nIf you've been urinating more frequently than usual, your pee may appear clear because it's more diluted. When you urinate, the kidneys filter out waste products and excess fluid from your blood. The filtered fluid then travels through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until you empty it. During urination, some of the fluid is lost through evaporation, so the remaining fluid becomes more concentrated. As a result, clear pee is often a symptom of increased urine production.\nIt's possible that the clear color is due to dehydration, but it can be caused by other factors as well. One possibility could include drinking more water than you normally would, leading to an increase in urine volume. Alternatively, you may have recently started taking a diuretic medication, such as Lasix (furosemide), which increases urine flow. In either case, drinking plenty of fluids and monitoring your intake can usually help resolve the issue.\nClear urine could indicate that there is an issue with your kidney function. Kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from the blood, as they are the body's main filtration system. A decrease in kidney filtration can result in a buildup of waste in the bloodstream, causing the urine to appear cloudy or even bloody. Other", "- Dr. David Pearson.\nSome drugs can reduce or increase urine output, so you may use this test to check if a drug is working. What happens: Your doctor checks a sample of your urine for glucose, protein, and other substances to look for signs of kidney disease or problems with the production or use of urine.\nUrinalysis, a test performed at a laboratory or a doctor's office, tests your pee, looking for bacteria, proteins, blood or sugar. These are all signs that something in your body is wrong. But some.\nSoaking in a hot, plain water bath for 30 minutes may help relax your kidneys.

If a person has more yellow urine, it may contain more uric acid. Yellow urine on a regular basis could result from medical causes. One common cause is dehydration. A lack of water prevents the body from metabolizing waste products properly, so they pass through the urinary tract. While colorless urine may be normal, if a patient had clear urine after consuming any form of a liquid, then such a case would suggest severe dehydration (as water is considered as liquid).

If you are not feeling any relief from the cymbalata, I would not stop it. You may want to increase the dose to 90 mg and see if that helps. It may take a few weeks to feel the full effect of the medication.\nIf you do decide to go on the SSNRI, you may have to start at a lower dose and work your way up. Some people have a hard time with the side effects of SSNRIs.", "?\nI am weaning off of Cipro and stopped taking it on Dec. 31 and took the last 25mg dose on Jan.1st (was taking 500mg for 10yrs).

I cannot take Z-paks anymore because in 1988 I had a rash on my legs, that I was admitted into the hospital for, due to allergies and have never taken one since. But, I would like to be able to take an antibiotic if need be.\nDo you think I should tell my PCP about the side effects of Zyprexa? She is very good and never pressures or judges me when I discuss things, she only wants to do what is best for me. She actually asked me if I wanted to try another med, but I do not want another medication from this category as I always feel out of it.\nIs it ok to go cold turkey and stop taking the Lamictal? I did stop it around the 3rd week as we have been talking about this since the end of June! We were going to slowly wean off the meds, one by one, starting with the Klonopin. The Kip is a horrible side effect medication, especially when working in a job with children. Do you recommend that the other meds be weaned off one at a time? Or will I be ok going cold off my Lam?\nFor a very long time, for example 7 years, my son and I were always told that ADHD is something that affects mostly boys/men. However, this doesn't seem to fit with my sons experience so I'm wondering..... Is ADHD really a gender issue/does it affect boys/girls/both male and female?", "Do you withdraw from Cymabalta to get rid of the side effects? If I stop cold turkey will the withdrawl be worse?\nCymbaltais an Antidepressant that affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause depression, anxiety disorder, or other mental disorders. The exact way Cynbalta works is Unknown but it may help the patient by changing the balance of nerves that send and receive signals to different parts of you brain. These chemicals affect mood, thoughts, and feelings.\nZolofts works Similar to Cypmbalta. But Zolof does not change the level of neurotransmitters. Zoolft prevents the relaese of a very short acting neurotransmitter called serotonin which binds to the receptors on the surface of nerve cells, thereby blocking the action of serotonin. This results in a higher concentration of 5-HT in brain synaptic clefts. If the higher level remains constant, adaptation can be avoided. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 55-HT) is an indolamines which is one of several neurotransimitters (NT) involved in information processing in nerve communication.\nTo get relief from side effect from zoloct first you should follow doctor prescriptions and take zolft. In rare side effec is zoolf causing panic attacks. For panic attack it is recommended CPM. Cough is the most common side affect. There are others, most which are more common for CMB, like dry mouth. I have experienced dry eyes, which I hear about in very very rare occasions. Like CYP, zolt is addictive and once you stop, you will start to experience withdrawal symptoms, mostly mood swings.\nI take Cimbalt for a sleep problem and that was a year ago. It made me very sleepy and I do not have a problem with sleeping. What if they tell you have to take these medications after a certain amount of time in order to avoid a relapse? And if you do withdrawls is that considered a depression relaps or two?\nYes, in some serious cases of some mental conditions patients require long term treatment to stay mentally stable, hence Antipressents. While for some it becomes addiction after some months. One side affects of addiction, is relapses, but addiction is a disease. Once addicted will suffer all side efects and mental relaspes. Hence the need of long-term treatment like zombit", "I know that I can't take both at the same time but I'm curious if a 2 day gap would be an issue? Also, any reason to wait a few days longer?\nI started on Zyprexa and Cipralex and I had to switch to ZOloft and Risperdal because of the weight gain of Zypera and lack of weight lost. Any idea on Risp and Zoleft combo? They don't seem compatible but if it's been working for someone, maybe is just temporary?\nRisperidone (risperdal) and zoloften can work together. The only possible adverse effect is of nausea which risperdon has as a minor side effect.\nRispcan be hard to dose. you need to start low and increase every 1-2 days. the start dose is 0.25 mg taken twice per day. for example you take 10 days of 6-3 mg, then you can raise the dose to 16-4 mg.. You can go to the maximum dose of rispcin in a couple of weeks.\nThanks, I will try it and let you know.", "I know it might sound like it could be a shock to the system if I were to try to go cold turkey from the cyp but I just don\u2019t think I can keep taking the doseage I\u2019m on right now.

It seems like there might be something in the brain that would not like this kind of \u201cshock\u201d treatment and it may make me feel worse\u2026..I really don't wanna take anymore of my current meds. I also need to get off this other med that I\u2019ve been taking for my anxiety called buspar which my doc took me off of a couple of days ago because it was not working. Does anyone have any ideas? Also I was wondering why it is that if you go off one med if for some reason it\u2019s working, what is the best way for you to deal with the symptoms or what\u2019s the least dangerous way?\nI haven\u2019t used either of these drugs myself, but for myself in stopping Wellbutrin I reduced the amount daily until I stopped taking it. For me, this was the worst way imaginable and caused a number of problems.\nA very smooth withdrawal for me was going off Klonopin (clonazepam) cold-turkey. This was possible because of how the drug works in your body, the body just doesn\u2019t react to removing it quickly. It took a long time (weeks) to notice a difference. You know you\u2019re in trouble with K with a fast withdrawal when you develop something called \u201cthe wobble\u201d. I haven\u2019 t even heard of this, and I am sure you don\u2019 \u2018t want to either.\nAs far as the buspirone (generic for busprion), I don \u2019t know anything about this one. But, as with any med, you should go slow in reducing it, unless your doctor has given you permission to quit altogether.\nBest wishes, try for slow withdrawl.\nThanks. Yea but if my brain has adjusted to them and they have not helped me in a while I think that going cold turbo from them is not a wise choice because then I won\u2019t just have one set of symptoms to battle at time, I\u2019d have the new ones to.

Please feel free to join #anxiety or #zoloftime if you like.\nHello I see you made your way over from a previous forum you shared with. Welcome here. If your experience is anything like mine anxiety meds can be hard to get on, to make a change and to tolerate, as it sounds like yours is. Also they are metabolled in your liver quickly, so changing dosages can have an impact.\nI would suggest if that is not your first choice of treatment to work with your doctor to explore anxiety alternatives. There are herbs, diet and lifestyle changes and cognitive therapy that can work, for some, very well. Medications can and do cause problems and as I can attest you can't predict how your body will react. For some like me it takes a lot and even then it can change. In a few months I will be cutting my dose in half and seeing if I still need it.\nMy advice would to really listen to your own body and your mind, especially your gut.

But I do want my family to continue with their lives and not have me at home or feel uncomfortable with me when they are outside and dealing with social circles etc.\nNot sure if I did a reply here and sent it or if it came up as \"awaiting approval of an administrator\"\nI did not mean to have it in that status.\nMy doctor said he cannot help anymore with sweating medications and that she is sending me back for more psychotherapy to see if that can really help. I am on medication now from a psychiatrist too with little to no improvement at all and still suffering from an anxiety disorder.", "I will be in contact with a doctor tomorrow and just need something for when I get cold sweats, if you're able to provide?\nSorry.

{"Question": "Is there anything I can do about feeling like Im going to pass out?", "Free_form_answer": "Fainting is a brief loss of consciousness caused by a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. In healthy individuals, fainting is possible for various reasons, like not eating or drinking enough, standing for long periods, standing up too quickly, or experiencing emotional stress. Identifying the triggers that cause this sensation can help reduce the frequency of fainting episodes. Additionally, when you feel like you might faint, certain techniques can improve the blood flow to your brain and prevent you from fainting. These include lying down if possible, sitting and placing your head between your knees, squeezing your thighs together, and crossing your legs and arms. Fainting can also be caused by serious health issues related to the heart and brain.

Dizziness often, as you say, follows a period of physical and mental exhaustion. Not enough sleep, and a lack of proper nutrition will do it. I don't know your diet or sleeping habits, but I do know that I'm prone to these periods of exhaustion, especially when my physical activity is high. The thing I think I am doing to help is taking a few herbal supplements that help me recover. They do not stop fatigue, they just help speed the recovery process. One I use is Bitters. It's actually a herbal tea made from a combination of plants. If you can't acquire or don\u2019t want to bother with herbal teas, one very good supplement is called \"Astragalus\". Take a look at it! I believe it will help. But don,t take it if you\u2019re allergic to ragweed. A more gentle and milder supplement that seems to work for me during these times are the \"Liver Supplements\". They are just that: supplements to support general liver health. Now, in my case, that means supporting the liver's ability to process the waste products from the detoxification of chemicals. That might not b e true for you. Some of mine would work fine for supporting a liver that is overwhelmed with toxins from poor diet and lack water. Anyway, those are products which are fairly inexpensive and available in any natural foods store. Also, a good diet. Avoid refined sugars and carbohydrates... try to get plenty of fresh water.. not soda. Do more exercise... it might sound counterintuitive but it's the best remedy I've found for this. Get one or two sessions with a chiropractor and have a proper adjustment done. Chiropractic Care is an adjunct therapy that has helped me tremendously through my difficult times. My other suggestion is try this: Take an Epsom Salts bath three times a week. Use about 2 cups during each bath. Then drink a gallon of water daily between baths. This should help greatly.", "Sometimes I will actually faint but I've never really noticed if it happens just when standing up or while doing something or if I'm walking or not.

But I took a lot of pain killers for my back pain, so here's a few suggestions. Try a muscle relaxant first. If that doesn't help, then a low dose of codeine for pain would likely work.

If really bad pain I sometimes take co-codyramol. But I know that some don;t like co. or par. Ibuprofren is good but if your not fond of painkillers then I suggest you try something else.\nThere's an anti-inflammatory that won't give you the same type of headaches as Paracetomol does. It's Celebrex, but I don't know if that's available on the NHS.\nI second Celecoxib. Try all options - NSAIDs, Paracetomols (I get migraines but haven't had any problems), codeine (if the non-opioids didn't work, codeines are supposed to be much worse for migraine, so I'd only go that route if all else failed), and NSAID/paracetol codes. Also, try to take them all as early in your cycle as you can - I find a few nights before my period is usually the sweet spot. For codeins, you might need to speak to your doctor about getting codeone linctus for a while - it's much better than the standard Parvado as the latter does nothing for pain (just the constipation).\nI'm sorry I posted on here last night and now I realise that I have totally forgotten that it is you (you know who you are :rolleyes ;) ) and not me that is affected by this particular issue now.\nFor me I normally cope with taking Ibrof, that seems the best one to ease period pain without the migraine etc. that you get with other pain killers. Sometimes if it really gets me, then co-dydramal is a bit better because it also contains codein, which does help me. At my age, this pain generally only happens the day or so just before the period itself.\nJust to add to what has been said already, your period should come, eventually :p, even if not quite when you think and would expect it.

Check for side effects and precautions to be considered while using it. It is essential that you consider any drug interaction with the other medicine that your body is having and then take the drug accordingly.\nSome natural remedies for joint pain (like the following) may provide some relief:\n  1. Epsom salts. Add 2 cups of E psom and 3 cups warm water to a small tub and soak for 15 to 20 minutes.

Hope this helps.\nI can't give any advice about medications for pain, as I am not a doctor, however, I will share a natural, inexpensive, effective remedy that I have used myself for many years - with results. After a session at the gym I sometimes wake in the morning with a bit of an ache, so I take a spoonful from a jar I keep nearby and it helps immensely. The jar contains powdered mustard or horseradish mixed with about the same ratio of oil (olive or other neutral oil). It's important to have the ratio correct, in order for it to work better. If the powder is too thick, add more oil; if it is not liquid enough, more powder. Then find a tiny container to dip in. I use the bottom of a medicine dropper. Each \"scoop\" is about a third of the way up the droplet (about 0.3ml).

Also the short breaths and short talks are common in bron chitis. If left untreated, bron c h itis can lead to pneumonia.\nBronc hitis is the inflammation or swelling of bron chi al tubes due to viral or bacterial infection, injury or irritants such a cigarette smoke. Usually it is infectious. The typical symptoms are cough, fever, short ness of breathe, white, yellow or green sputum, mild chest pain, little fatigue and some blood in s putum.\nThe bronchia are the right and left tubes that run from the trachea (windpipe) at the top of your lungs to your diaphragm at your bottom of bottom. These bronchal tubes branch into smaller and smaller air passageways, finally terminating in tiny air sacs called alveoli.\nIf you are diagnosed with bronci tis, then it must be taken care of properly to avoid further complications.

Can I get both at the same time?\nAnswer: Bronchiolitiss respiratory infection which leads to the narrow walls of the tubes which connect the nose and mouth and the lungs. Viruses are the most common cause of bronchiole; but in rare cases, it can cause a bacterial infection.\nThere is no medicine that works against viruses. Cough and fever can be treated with paracetamol. If the child has coughed hard, she can spit her coughing up as a result of having phlegm.\nDo not give aspirin or ibuprofen to children younger than 16 years old.\nViral bronchois not infect each other or other members of your family.\nThe following guidelines are published by the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Broncholoitiss section.\nMost bronchie are caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an infection that is in the fluid of their mouth in 10-20% of healthy children by their first birthday, but not by themselves.\nMany children who have mild pneumonia will not need any treatment. However, a doctor should check regularly on children with a bad cough or a high fever (over 39.4 degrees Celsius). If it is, the RSV infection or the secondary respiratory tract infection ( bacterial pneumonia ) may be present. It may require antibiotic treatment for secondary infections.

This is true for babies, such as, as they will often get a lower fever than adults. They do, however, have some symptoms such a hard cough. The most serious symptoms for a infant with brinchitis are dehydration and oxygen depletion. Signs of dehydration in infants include low energy, lack of tears and sunken skin on the top of babies. Babies usually breathe around 30 to 60 times a minute. With more serious breathing, they may breathe less, which could be fatal.\nIf your infant is under one year", "- Forum\nBronchial asthma is a disease in which the bronchi are persistently narrowing. It is characterized by persistent attacks of dyspnea, cough accompanied by sputum, which cannot be easily excreted from the lungs. In bronchia, excessive spasm leads to inflammation, mucus and pus formation. When the body tries to get rid of inflammation and infection, increased cough forces phlegm out. Therefore, a cough with bronchoconstriction is also accompanied not only by difficulty in expectoration, but also in breathing. A distinctive feature of bronchopulmonary asthma, manifested in episodes of shortness of breath, is breath.\nBronchiolitis is inflammation of the airways (bronchi) that causes narrowing of their lumen and a decrease in the cross section of respiratory bronchioles. The symptoms of this disease are cough (dry cough), painful breathing, low-grade fever. Bronchiolis in children is diagnosed much more often than in adults. This is due to the peculiarities of immunity. By age 5, bronchlitis can be diagnosed in 50-70% of patients.

The infectious bronchi tis causes severe damage to lung. When the air passages become infected with virus their lining starts swelling causing irritation in air chambers. This is the primary bronc itis symptom.\n\u00a0 There are some cases when bronchioles may get infected and when this happens in smokers it can be a sign that serious health conditions have developed in the person. Another common name for bronchoii t is bronchia ltis. In this situation actually the broncheal tubes become inflamed and damage occurs in their lines. What Causes This Disease? We had at first written a rough assignment on Bronchi Tis. Then after a few improvisions and enhancements here and there, we have ended up with this end product.\nThere are common symptoms of acute bron chit i s like fevers, headache, sore throat, chills and breathlessness. Is there a cure for bro nc h it is? Yes. There is a natural cure fr o n ch it i se. It requires no medications or surgery that is very expensive and it requires only natural supplements that can awarde you a permanent cure form bro n c h i t i a. Such natural remedy with S p e c i fi c blends would be s h ow n hen e.\nWhat are the symptoms? Very contagious, bronco iti s spreads quite easily and, it has a major effect upon the respiratory tract. Using hard laxatives also can accelerate the process of bron c hi t s and its symptoms. Writing is something that has to be done when one is in possession of this promotion.\nSome Precautions\nAvoid swine influenza in many ways but the most important factor is to maintain proper hy a l ene, meaning: Washing your hands frequently. Get a flu vaccine each year before it reaches epidemic mark. Try to avoid individuals that have the flu. Here we go! Smile\nSymptoms of Breathing Illness\nFever is also a symptom of bro ne c hit i ss and this may or may not be accompanied with a cough. On the other hand, if fever is not there the s i ghtofa cough for a day or two with foul sputum or phlegm may assure you about br onch itiss. Since the cough may also come along with s te orosis, itching etc.", "Is there any cure? The answer is yes. Bronchial infections are so contagious and are very commonly seen in the winter season. They have been associated with the colds and flue symptoms. But bronchi does not relate to any of the two conditions, these infections mostly occur when you are already very weak. Therefore, you should always be careful about broncho and the first symptom you feel is cold or flou, then you need to cure it in a very early stage.\nAcutely ill patients can be treated with medication. There are two important types of medication for an effective cure: 1) bronchodilators, which open contracted airways and make breathing easier, and 2) anti-inflammatory medicines, to relieve inflammation that leads to chronic disease.\nMedication should be taken as long as you still have symptoms, for at least 4 months, although your doctor may ask you to continue taking it beyond that time. If you stop early it is possible that your symptoms will return. You should therefore discuss treatment duration with your practitioner.\nChronic bronchopulmonary infection is treated by means of a low dose of macrolide for 3 to 6 months. In case the infection has recurred the dose can even be increased and administered for another period.\nIf the doctor prescribes antibiotics they have to be started as soon as possible, within 72 hours of symptoms onset.\nMost of us know that bronchio is mostly a common cold in adults and children. So in that case, I believe it will be cured by the same medicine that we use for common flues and cold.\nA common infection such as a cold and other viral respiratory infections like a sinus congestion or nasal congestion (allergies), pneumonia, measles, adenoid infections, flu and bronco pneumonia can lead to bronchie.\nSo in conclusion, bronchia can take many different forms, but always begins with what can also be known as an upper respiratory influenza (usually the common flu).\nBronchs, also called acute bronichitis in general, are infections of lower respiratory air pathways like the trachea and lungs. It is usually caused by viral infections and bacteria and can affect anyone, both children and adults.\nThere are many types (causes) of chronic bronhi and according to recent studies there are a lot of different cases. To treat them you have different medications such, antibiotics and more natural ones as well.\nHowever, the main concern here is that you can suffer from flu", "What foods should I eat?\nBronchial health is a primary part of good lung health. When a respiratory infection hits us our bronchioles become inflamed and red, which makes us cough. It\u2019s very painful and difficult to deal with.\u00a0\nInfections can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and if the immune system has to be weakened, it can affect our health and we might suffer from allergic symptoms\u00a0and other complications. If the infection is caused mainly by bacteria then it\u2019s called bronchopneumonia, but no matter what kind of infection it is the symptoms are the same. Most of the times the infections start with a flu. They can also start from allergies, from smoking or from poor nutrition.\nThe bronchi are very similar to the blood vessels, so if we don\u2019t give them enough nutrients or drink too much caffeine (as with coffee and some teas), they become irritated, inflammed, red and they will also be more prone to infections. Good and beneficial foods are those that soothe the irritated bronchia, by providing them with nourishment and hydration and by eliminating inflammation. So we should be eating fruits and vegetables daily and drink plenty of fluids. The immune systems also needs support, not only in the treatment,\u00a0but also in\u00a0building a long term\u00a0health.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn short, the best things you can do are to:\n  1. Drink lots of water, at least with some fresh fruits (or herbs)\n \u00a02. Avoid foods that cause inflammation - fried foods, heavy processed meat, sugar, white flour, dairy, alcohol, caffeine, etc.\n 3. Eat lots and lots\u00a0of fresh vegetables - carrots, peas, bell peppers, tomatoes; cruciferous - broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage; dark greens - spinach, parsley, nettles, fenugreek, dandelion, burdock; onions, garlic, leeks, fresh mushrooms, beets, carrots and radishes.\u00a0Eat herbs and spices - ginger root, fennel root and seed, thyme, oregano, rosemary, turmeric, mustard seeds, cumin, allspice, coriander, cloves and anise seed. \u00a0\n 4. Get fresh air - it helps to open your bronchos.

In rare cases minoxyidil can damage scalp skin or even cause an autoimmune disease called sarcoidosis.\nMinoxidyl is the first FDA -approved drug for temporary hair regrowth in men. Minoxodilyl works by widening blood vessels and hair follicles, which allows blood to flow better to the hair roots and helps the hairs to grow. It's a lot like what happens when you're pregnant and your hair starts to fall out. (Methane) works in a different way, by helping the body produce more androgens, the hormones that regulate the growth and development of males. This effect is similar to what you get when a child is born and you hear them crying with a clear voice.\nThe most common side effects of minotxodicyl are: - dry skin around your lips - irritation of your scalp - itchiness of the scalp and face - itching of scalp or face If you do not notice these changes, then it's probably because you have already lost all of this hair or it has not regrown. If it doesn't grow within three weeks, you should stop using it.\nIt's not recommended for people who suffer from severe hair loss, because minroxodyl can make the problem worse by reducing your body's absorption of DHT which is needed to stimulate new follicle growth.

I will always advise women to quit minied as long as it doesn't work, because if they go bald, they cannot take hormones because of a higher risk of cancer due to hormone abuse.\ni am pretty sure i have the lowest minnosed rate in the world.\n1/4 teaspoon 75 minxed every night for 9 months.\nstill hair. no change. nothing. that is it.\nso i guess in an ideal situation using minimal minosed, you might experience minimal sideeffects\ni do not know, if i were to double or triple my dose. i might have sideffects.\nsideeffects and reactions can vary from different people so we do have our own experiences.\nmine was like 500mg in my first few weeks.\nalso my blood pressure dropped a little bit.\nwell, as for sideaffects, well. mine could have been worse. but as someone said, side affects", "i have no clue about this chemical and i use it. i see that it is not used for women and wonder that this might do something strange to my female hormonal system. any input on this would be greatly apreciated.\ni heard some horrible stories about cancer when it was on tv when they were giving some people a free haircut that gave them cancer, but i don't know if its a scam or not. so, i'd like to know what everyone else things about it.\nI don\u00b4t know any side effects of applying minodil on female hairline, since that\u00b4s the reason why I found this place in the internet... There are some warnings, that you have to leave it to dry for 4 hours before touching the area and that nobody should use in if the woman is pregnant. But I\u00b4ve been using it for almost one year now and I would\u00b4t stop using if it starts working.\nIt takes time for minox to work, and in some cases even longer. And it's not like you apply it only for a month and then you go back to no minix. It will keep working over time too. Just because it doesn't work for you when you first stop doesn\u00b4t mean that some months down the road you can try again and it won\u00b4t work. For me it took about 6 months to notice the effect, so stick it out, it might take some time....it\u00b4s like all the rest, no quick cure...only time.\nyou might want to stop eating red meats, as research have shown that red meat has a lot of androgen and promotes hair loss, this may be very crucial for female pattern hairloss sufferers because of the fact that male pattern baldness in women progresses to the point where they will completely bald like men. you may want also to try a vitamin D (4000 iu) in 2-3 month cycle. hope this helps.\nThanks for the help! I eat little red meet anyways, if i eat it at all in a rare occasion. I use a multivitamin with D 1000iu that i take everyday. This should work together.\nand it has something to do with hair growth.\nalso your doctor might be able to order some blood tests to check if your hormones are normal.\nIf it does anything to alter your hormonal production, then I'd be highly suspicious. We still don;t know enough about the risks of minrox. Some say it increases", "I can't find much information online. It doesn't seem that I would be able to get it here unless i use this site. Any input and knowledge would help.\nWell, let's go with some background here. Minoxidil is a blood pressure medication developed in the 1960s, marketed in oral form as Loniten and in topical form (5% minoxodil) for hair loss as Rogaine, or its generic equivalent. The primary side effect it has is low bloodpressure, but also a sideeffect of hypertrichosis (hair growth), which was first observed in men treated with oral minnoxidol, who developed thick long terminal hair on their torsos and feet (although I think this is very uncommon). It was then tried in animal models for baldness and found to restore hair growth in bald animals - hence its present day use in humans.\nAs a hairloss drug, it is generally safe, as it doesn\u2019t have many other side effects. To use it, you apply it twice daily to the thinning areas, and it works by increasing the amount of blood flow and oxygen to hair follicles, which allows follicular cells to grow stronger more normal hairs, eventually restoring hair to its previous level of growth.\nI have used minnoxdil for almost 18 years, using it as part of my hair restoration strategy, where it helps to build up hair volume to give a more natural appearance. Because the side-effect is hairgrowth, we can use the drug to fill in thin areas of hair with terminal-like hair (not too big), and this was my way of hiding any visible bald spots during the first 5 years of transplanting. I used Minoa after all the transplants were over, just to try to encourage more longterm stability. One thing i noticed was that when combined with fin, results can be more dramatic.\nIt is unlikely that you\u2019d experience sideeffects like hipertricosis. And if you do and are concerned, go and ask a doctor to check you out, although as I said in my review on Rogain, if I needed one, i would probably just give it some time, because the bloodwork test can actually be done by yourself by feeling your pulse, looking to see if your fingers or toes are very cold, by looking in your mirror, checking your eyes, etc, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much.\nGood luck with mino. and", "Or is it safe?\nIt doesn't harm, and if you take it only on some hairs, or use it in hair products, it will not make them grow on the other areas, as it is like any other medicine, you should use some sunblock while in the sun, but everything else is good.\nHi Kian! Glad to see you here. As you know, in terms of hair loss or hair growth treatment minoxidal is the most widely used drug in this area. And yes, despite the fact that minovid is widely applicable and often recommended by doctors it has some precautions. For example: minocid should not be mixed with other drug products containing minodoxil. It should preferably not mix with any products with alcohol. Also the drug is contraindicated to pregnancy women. If you have been taking minovil for more than 3 years, there is a risk of getting permanent hair problems, like: hair changes direction, becoming too thin, so it's preferable to take the treatment not longer than it was mentioned in your doctor's prescription."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.0694, "rouge1_r": 0.375, "rouge1_f1": 0.1171, "rouge2_p": 0.0058, "rouge2_r": 0.0323, "rouge2_f1": 0.0099, "rougel_p": 0.0462, "rougel_r": 0.25, "rougel_f1": 0.078, "bleurt": 0.2508, "bert_score_p": 0.8431, "bert_score_r": 0.7971, "bert_score_f1": 0.8195, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5202, "rouge1_r": 0.2368, "rouge1_f1": 0.3255, "rouge2_p": 0.1105, "rouge2_r": 0.0501, "rouge2_f1": 0.069, "rougel_p": 0.185, "rougel_r": 0.0842, "rougel_f1": 0.1157, "bleurt": 0.3211, "bert_score_p": 0.8113, "bert_score_r": 0.8429, "bert_score_f1": 0.8268, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4277, "rouge1_r": 0.1827, "rouge1_f1": 0.2561, "rouge2_p": 0.064, "rouge2_r": 0.0272, "rouge2_f1": 0.0382, "rougel_p": 0.1734, "rougel_r": 0.0741, "rougel_f1": 0.1038, "bleurt": 0.2409, "bert_score_p": 0.7986, "bert_score_r": 0.8205, "bert_score_f1": 0.8094, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3931, "rouge1_r": 0.157, "rouge1_f1": 0.2244, "rouge2_p": 0.0465, "rouge2_r": 0.0185, "rouge2_f1": 0.0265, "rougel_p": 0.1734, "rougel_r": 0.0693, "rougel_f1": 0.099, "bleurt": 0.2628, "bert_score_p": 0.7938, "bert_score_r": 0.8107, "bert_score_f1": 0.8022, "hallucination": 75.0, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5087, "rouge1_r": 0.2189, "rouge1_f1": 0.3061, "rouge2_p": 0.1047, "rouge2_r": 0.0449, "rouge2_f1": 0.0628, "rougel_p": 0.2139, "rougel_r": 0.092, "rougel_f1": 0.1287, "bleurt": 0.2916, "bert_score_p": 0.8144, "bert_score_r": 0.8342, "bert_score_f1": 0.8241, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3179, "rouge1_r": 0.3073, "rouge1_f1": 0.3125, "rouge2_p": 0.0698, "rouge2_r": 0.0674, "rouge2_f1": 0.0686, "rougel_p": 0.1387, "rougel_r": 0.1341, "rougel_f1": 0.1364, "bleurt": 0.2829, "bert_score_p": 0.8376, "bert_score_r": 0.827, "bert_score_f1": 0.8322, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

This can take some detective work. Once the cause is identified, you have a much better chance at healing. So, start with a diet that excludes caffeine, alcohol, dairy, wheat, processed sugary snacks, sodas, and white flour from refined products. Drink lots of purified water to flush the digestive tract. Eat healthy foods such as organic fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, fish, grains, poultry, eggs, meat, goat cheese, yogurt, kefir, coconut milk, milk thistle seeds and oil. Cut out all sugar in any form. Do not eat too much fruit at a time. Try to eat a half cup of fruit every two hours. These will all help to heal the intestinal lining. If you do continue to have symptoms, take a high-quality probiotic such a Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifudum, as symptoms may indicate that your intestinal flora need to be more balanced. And make sure you get outside and into nature\u2014this will help you to relax, which will aid the healing process. Other good things to add to the diet are organic raw almond butter, avocado, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, miso, sauerkraut, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar, blackstrap molasses, chia or flax seeds. Also, if you are a man, consume an average of 1 teaspoon of sea vegetables each day. In addition, try to make the majority of your food from raw organic foods. You could also consider taking probiotics. One to try is Primal Defense at http://www.iherb.com/Enzymatic-Therapy-Primal-Defense-15-Tablets-180-Day-Source-Energy-Food-2-Oz/192?at=0&gclid=CLPDyfC6_MkCFYZv4AodEg4AIg\nIf you need additional help, do some research on food allergies. Eliminate the foods you suspect may cause you problems until the symptoms are gone. Then slowly reintroduce them back into your diet.

Symptoms vary from none to mild to severe irritation and itching with or without blood. Sometimes there is an external fissu re (outside) and then one or more internal fiss ures (inside).\nThe external site of the fiss ure that is seen (the outside skin) often turns white or gray and may have no drainage until the wound is cleaned with saline (salt) solution. Icing (not hot packs or heat) the area can help with the healing. The use of analgesics ( anti-pain medications) (Advil, ibuprofen, Tylenol, etc) may be helpful to reduce pain. Topical anesthetics such tetracaine or xylocaine applied to the site helps reduce discomfort. If there are no complications, these fiss ur es tend to heal within two to four weeks after surgery. However internal ones may last longer. Analgesic creams, antibiotics, and stool softeners may help reduce the discomfort of these lesions.\nAspirin Can Decrease Inflammation.

I am assuming that the area of concern is on a thin fold of skin that when fully stretch is approximately 3mm in thickness (just the right thickness to be a good sphincter muscle). It is a condition in which the skin under the sphingtic muscle, being under constant, albeit very little pressure, causes it to stretch to a certain amount. In a lot of cases the fissuring is caused by chronic constipation or diarrhea. The problem with this particular skin fold is when the muscles around it contract it has no where to go so it just stretches to that thickness. When this constant state of stretching occurs, the blood vessels feeding the anal cushions to keep them plush disappear and the muscle cannot properly contract. This happens when an individual with anal flexure is unable to empty themselves of their bodily wastes effectively. It can happen to anybody at any time as long as pressure around the flexor is enough to cause this to happen. There are many over the counter remedies that will attempt to resolve this condition; however they are seldom successful in doing so and tend to make the problem worse. Some of the things that help is proper diet, exercise, daily fiber intake and drinking as many as a half of body weight (in pounds) of water each day. Please understand, constipated individuals should be placed on special diets when they first start to have this problem or they will never find a resolution to their discomfort. As constipitation and anal flexibility continues the person starts to develop incontinence issues along with other embarrassing problems. For most people, once it gets to this extent, it is usually well beyond their comfort level and surgery should have been done a long time ago. Just because you are still having bowel movements doesn\u2019t mean that you have fully evacuated from your colon. Once a fissuria (as it occurs), it can stay like that until the condition is permanently resolved or until pressure is relieved. A full colon hydrotherapy session should take care of this situation. If that isn\u2019t an option, then you should seriously consider consulting a professional to assess the fullness, or complete emptiness, of your rectal cavity. No amount of food, water, laxatives and fiber will change this fact. Surgery will have to come into play and it should start with a full colonic irrigation session followed by 30 days of treatment under colon therapy to see"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5124, "rouge1_r": 0.1598, "rouge1_f1": 0.2436, "rouge2_p": 0.075, "rouge2_r": 0.0233, "rouge2_f1": 0.0355, "rougel_p": 0.2066, "rougel_r": 0.0644, "rougel_f1": 0.0982, "bleurt": 0.3002, "bert_score_p": 0.8099, "bert_score_r": 0.8383, "bert_score_f1": 0.8239, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.157, "rouge1_r": 0.3167, "rouge1_f1": 0.2099, "rouge2_p": 0.0167, "rouge2_r": 0.0339, "rouge2_f1": 0.0223, "rougel_p": 0.1074, "rougel_r": 0.2167, "rougel_f1": 0.1436, "bleurt": 0.2947, "bert_score_p": 0.8582, "bert_score_r": 0.8124, "bert_score_f1": 0.8347, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.281, "rouge1_r": 0.0958, "rouge1_f1": 0.1429, "rouge2_p": 0.0167, "rouge2_r": 0.0056, "rouge2_f1": 0.0084, "rougel_p": 0.1736, "rougel_r": 0.0592, "rougel_f1": 0.0882, "bleurt": 0.2816, "bert_score_p": 0.779, "bert_score_r": 0.8131, "bert_score_f1": 0.7957, "hallucination": 42.857142857142854, "comprehensive": 57.14285714285714}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4545, "rouge1_r": 0.1567, "rouge1_f1": 0.2331, "rouge2_p": 0.025, "rouge2_r": 0.0086, "rouge2_f1": 0.0128, "rougel_p": 0.1983, "rougel_r": 0.0684, "rougel_f1": 0.1017, "bleurt": 0.2713, "bert_score_p": 0.8019, "bert_score_r": 0.8276, "bert_score_f1": 0.8146, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2727, "rouge1_r": 0.275, "rouge1_f1": 0.2739, "rouge2_p": 0.0333, "rouge2_r": 0.0336, "rouge2_f1": 0.0335, "rougel_p": 0.1322, "rougel_r": 0.1333, "rougel_f1": 0.1328, "bleurt": 0.2773, "bert_score_p": 0.8404, "bert_score_r": 0.8368, "bert_score_f1": 0.8386, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.405, "rouge1_r": 0.1129, "rouge1_f1": 0.1766, "rouge2_p": 0.025, "rouge2_r": 0.0069, "rouge2_f1": 0.0108, "rougel_p": 0.1901, "rougel_r": 0.053, "rougel_f1": 0.0829, "bleurt": 0.2864, "bert_score_p": 0.801, "bert_score_r": 0.8255, "bert_score_f1": 0.8131, "hallucination": 57.14285714285714, "comprehensive": 42.857142857142854}]}

There are even pain relieving medications that specifically help with a soar throat. If all else fails I\u2019d recommend a visit to your doctor. They can help prescribe medication to make you more comfortable.\nOne of the best things to do is gargle. When your at risk of getting sick, gargles of warm salt (non-iodized) are a really good idea.

If they're worried about side effects and interactions, then they might not give it to you. Not to say your GP couldn't make a better decision, (after all, they do this all the time) but what your local pharmacist might be able to do is help.\nAt the pharmacy, ask if there's something you can get for this sort of pain.

I think it\u2019s more like a mix of ambient, relaxing music,", "If I'm doing it right and getting enough sleep, what's happening? Is it something related to the fact that I get a lot of my sleep late at night?\nThe other half of the equation is how to deal with the insomnia. Sometimes this is not a problem, or at least the problem doesn't feel insurmountable. But there are times I need more sleep so I can be at my best, whether that's for a presentation, a stressful event, to feel like my life is on the correct track, and that kind of thing. Any thoughts out there?\nI can't say I understand chronic sleeplessness, but I'd point out that it's possible that the amount of sleep you get has very little to do with how \"rested\" (or well-rested) you feel in the morning - certainly that has not been my experience. I've worked 5 and 6 day workweeks under very poor sleep conditions and actually felt worse as a result. What you may be experiencing is that without enough time to get deep sleep cycles you're simply too exhausted to rest. It takes a long time for your body to reset itself into sleep mode and it really has nothing to offer you until it reaches that point.\nThe key to getting a decent night of rest is to make sure that your bedtime is earlier and earlier each night. Make sure you know your natural sleep rhythm and don't push it. Don't try to stay up until very late, then get up in time the next morning to go about your affairs. Rather, just push yourself to bed earlier, so that when the time eventually comes when your deep-cycle wake-up is delayed past a reasonable hour you'll at minimum already be getting sleep and not just lying there in your bed wide-awake.\nOne thing I wonder is why you put so much pressure on yourself.\nFor the life of me why wouldn't you just cut into your sleep time when required (for a few days) and feel free to increase the sleep duration when you think the pressure decreases.\nI'm saying this on a personal note, I know plenty of people who do stuff the other way round - they tend to be very very busy with their careers and never really manage to find time - you have already more than enough, if it feels ok to you then I don;t understand pressure.\nAlso, keep using that medication. If that was a one-off dose then", "Is it beneficial to put on ambient only? I'm not sure about that, but if there was a way to make it be relaxing without falling asleep, I'd really like that.\nIn order to get some answers, first we need some clarification on what you're actually talking about.\nIf you mean some songs that are \"relaxing\" and they make you \"sleep\", the answer is yes; there are literally thousands of songs like these. You can find them in every genre, and even in classical music (there are entire symphonies dedicated to relaxing someone).\nBut let's talk about \"the benefits of ambient music for relaxation\".\nFirst of all you have to understand that ambient is one of the most relaxing genre you can listen to.\nSome ambient artists make songs and tracks that don't have any tempo or bass, in this case if you play those tracks for a few time you even start feeling you lack the bass (sounds crazy, right?). The point is: ambient tracks are made to be played in loops, so you should expect them to last a lot (or indefinitely) and feel the same all the way long.\nBut what is the benefit of this?\nRelaxation. Being relax doesn't mean necessarily being asleep. One of my favourite ambient musicians is Brian Eno, when he released \"Ambient 1: Music for Airports\" he actually wanted to create ambient soundscapes that were relaxing (and non-intrusive) enough to not distract/irritate travelers as they go through airports. Obviously if people start listening to ambient in their homes, ambient would help them relax too.\nSo if he wants to release an album that is relaxing, EMI didn't release it in the first place (which would have been ridiculous in my opinion, because you would spend a huge amount of money on something that cannot be sold), instead he sold it as \"a tool for airports\" to various airports and train stations, basically he asked those places to invest in relaxation.\nIt's all about selling a tool that's great and help people relaxing - not creating music that could make people falling to infinite sleep.\nThere are plenty of tracks of his that have already been used by companies (including airlines like United Airlines, Lufthansa, Virgin America...), all of them are relaxing and can be used to help sleeping, that said this doesn\u2019t really mean they were created for sleeping/rel", "I'd probably get the sleep, but not the same quality as I got the night before. I wonder if a good sleep could be replaced by ambient. So the question is:\nDoes ambient help?\nI also know some people who take some pills before sleeping. But I don't want to do so, since I'm scared that I'll be addicted on them. This is the main reason why I came up with this question.\nambient music insomnia sleeping sleeping-music\n@wodzu: That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! \u2013 user2284570 Feb 19 '18 at 14:02\nSo, it really depends on the individual and the ambient music. Some things have calming effects and others not. \u2013 woduzim Feb. 20 '19 at Music\nI don\u2019t think it would really be \u201creplaced\u201d by any method, regardless what it is, as there are still many variables that make sleeping happen, especially when it\u2019s a deep sleep.\nI have personally noticed that \u201clight\u201d ambient, such as \u201cBrian Eno\u2019s Apollo\u201d, which is very, VERY calming, almost as it gives off a kind of gentle \u201chum\u201d or \u201cbuzz\u201d that doesn\u2019t seem to have an end or a beginning, or even \u201cThe Shores of Valinor\u201d from the series by Enya, will definitely calm you down to a certain degree, and then I listen to music that has more rhythmic structure, along with a somewhat \u201chigher pulse\u201d, in a sense of frequency, which seems to bring more \u201cenergy\u201d to my body and mind, hence causing either a full \u201csleep\u201d (as mentioned, still on a \u201ccalm\u201d manner) or at least \u201cdose off\u201d, or maybe a short, 15-20 min nap. The latter I personally notice if I want or need a nap (due to being a workday, etc), and have recently \u201cdiscovered\u201d Ennio Morricone\u2019s soundtrack for The Thing as a perfect album to be used during this circumstance. And as an added factor, in my experience, the \u201ctiming\u201d of the process is also somewhat related, of course.\nAs for quality of sleep when using ambient/music, I usually use two different methods: One, when I just try to drift into sleep and don\u00b4t fully expect it to happen (especially if used in the middle of a non", "I am a pretty big person and not very light. My fiancee snores when we sleep together, so the ambient noise is not good. And, there are also times when I get startled from loud neighbors or even worse, strangers banging on my door. I could just turn the monitor off at night, but my fiance will wake up and think I\u2019m dead.\nThe ambient is only good for sleeping in public or if I don\u2019t want to disturb anyone else.\nI have tried it but I can\u2019t get a good understanding of how to use it. Does it make a huge difference to the sounds or just makes them quieter if it does.\nYeah I suppose you\u2019re right. It\u2019s more to let you fall asleep though, not sleep.\nIt may just be a matter of preference, and the difference may not be huge, however, it really does make quite a bit of difference in that regard. What you have to do is turn off all the noise generators (the birds, the ocean, etc.) and just have either the room or the background noises going (or both). I recommend the latter, because I believe that it helps my sleep better. When you do this, you will sleep quite well, I think!\nThank you for this wonderful post, as well as the other posts about ambient. These have been very helpful to me. Thank you so much!\nI use ambient at home with a noise generator for the hum and some natural background to mask other sounds. This is great but if your partner hears it then it becomes distracting.

Whilst most types are not contagious, T.

However the good news is that the fungus that causes T.Capitas is not transferable between humans (like for example HIV is), and in most cases can not be transferred from pets to humans either (a notable exception being cats).

Shah\nAnswered by Dr Vikas Goel\nTinea Capitis is a fungal infection on the scalp, which typically affects children. Tinea is an infection in which fungus (microscopic plant-like creature) affects the hair and scalp. Typically, children are affected either due to a genetic predisposition or because young children, due lack of handwashing are more susceptible compared to their older counterparts.\nTichy test is used by doctors to diagnose tinae capiti. It shows up as a halo around the affected hair. Other ways in diagnosing include microscopy or culture of the infected hair.\nA topical and oral antifungal can treat an existing tich. Doctors typically recommend Griseofulvin, though Flucansone, Terbinfine are preferred in recent times.

What would you advise?\nTinea Capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp and hair caused by micro -sponges (derma). Tinea is transmitted from infected areas, objects and infected pets. Therefore, it is advisable to take care of hygiene. If the hair is shorter than 5cm should be shaved. Use of antifungals (Ketaconazole or Trizonide) in combination with corticosteroids (prednisolone) for 6-8 weeks is recommended.", "And how to treat this condition effectively? Let us find out the answer in this article!\nTinea Capitis is an infection caused by fungus, which is mostly seen in children who are between the age of 3-17 years old. The infection is common and occurs in the scalp and beard. In most of the cases, the infection occurs due to the contact with the fungus. But, sometimes it can also occur on your skin via pets that harbor the fungi species. To know more about the Tinea infection disease and how it spreads, continue reading this post.\nWhat does tiena hair loss look like?\nTinae capis infection will cause itching and scaly patches on the infected hair. If the scarring alopecia is severe, then it does not grow back after the treatment. You will see the patches of hair falling out in a circular pattern around the hairline. Sometimes, there are red bumps that cause hair shafts to break. This happens usually when a child touches the skin in their nose and mouth.\nHow is Tienia Capis treated?\nAccording to research tinae hair fall treatment in infants will use different methods to keep the growth. Therefore, most parents might not know how this fungus spreads. And it becomes more dangerous when children, especially young boys, are at school and interacted with their peers.\nIf your child has tine capitais, it is time to get an oral fungal treatment from the doctor. Your child will be prescribed with anti-fungal medication, but it may take time for the medication to cure the fungal disease.

Is this an allergic reaction?", "Or a sinus thing?\nCan a viral infection like phargngtis be caused by allergies and/or a deviated septum?\nIf so, is there a medicine and can I still suffer from it if i start taking it.\nIt could be. The sinuses and the pharangeal spaces all drain into the back the throat so there is no reason that an irritant in the sinus cavity wouldn't cause a sore throat. An allergist could tell you what you are allergic to and you could avoid it. Sinus sprays and decongestants are useful as well. Also, if you really have post-nasal drip from the infection, it can be alleviated by nasal steroids. Please talk to your doctor and follow what they recommend.\nCould you be allergic?\nI would have to be able to see you to know if this is your main issue. I would start by getting allergy testing. There are two types of allergies the first is IgE mediated where you need the allergic antibody which is very specific to a particular allergen. However, there are many, many allergies such as lactose and gluten which are caused not by Ig E's but by a cellular response. If it is an IgG allergy I can usually see on your skin. It isn't just one person in twenty five who is allergic. It is one in every six; about a third of the population. And many times the main problem a person has is not their allergies at all.\nMy daughter has allergies but they are different from my wife's and mine. So what is normal allergy\nWell, normal is whatever your family is. Just because there aren't a lot of allergens in my family doesn't mean I shouldn't know them. But what your daughter is truly allergic can only be determined by testing her.\nWhat kind of doctor is best to treat an adult with severe hay fever type allergies?\nThe ideal doctor to diagnose and treat allergies is a board Certified allergists. You need him to identify exactly what the allergies are with special blood and skin testing done by an experienced allergst. They may then prescribe medication to control the symptoms.\nIs it possible for allergies to cause frequent coughs, congestion, and sinus problems and ear infections?\nYes, these symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of sinusitis, and allergies often cause sinus and breathing problems, so allergies may be a factor. Since you already have a history of cough, you should be checked for a chronic cough rather than an acute infection", "Is it connected to allergies or asthma? How do you have it diagnosed?\nThere's no known connection between viral sore throat and allergies and/or asthma. The soreness is most likely caused by streptococcal A bacteria; the strep bacteria. If your sore throats were being caused instead by other strains of streptoococcus (s. pneumonia and s. pyrogenes to name a couple) the diagnosis would be called \"nonspecific pharingtis.\"\nThe medical profession has not clearly defined the terms \"allergy\" and \"asthma\" for many years. It's much more useful for physicians to think of these symptoms as a group, called the \"atopic triad.\" For a patient to be diagnosed as having atopic asthma, he or she would need to have episodes of difficulty breathing with a sense of wheezing or whistling coupled with bouts of allergy (hay fever). The latter would normally mean a runny nose, itchy ears and eyes and sneezes. These symptoms would also often trigger a sore (scratchy) throat.", "If it is a virus, what caused the virus?\nI don't have a particular question, I'm just wondering if the phrase is useful or if I should just say allergic reaction instead. (I hope that's not too vague)\nYou hear it all the time: \"I think it's a viral infection.\" Or \"A viral upper respiratory infection.\"\nI believe that those \"viral\" infections are caused by antibodies. I think that if you could have an infection that causes you to come down with a cold, but not be able to pass those germs on to anyone else (you can be a carrier, say, by getting someone's used tissue in your hand and then rubbing your eye, etc.), then that would be an allergic response.\nI'm no microbiologist, so, if anyone knows, correct me, and I'll happily change my opinion.\nvirus viral allergy\nIn case you are still reading this question after all these years, yes, viral infections can occur without your having the chance of infecting someone else; but that happens only if your immune system destroys the viral particles before they have any time or opportunity to replicate. \u2013 o0'. Apr 23 at 13:54\nIs \"the cold\" a thing?\nWhat is \u201cvaping\u201d?", "That's one of the questions that I'm going to explore. I'll first look at the basics of viral and allergic phargngtis before I put the two together. Is it possible that allergies can turn a viral infection into a more severe or prolonged illness? Could allergy medicine help the viral illness last longer? How about the other way around? Can taking an antiviral medicine make allergies worse? Finally, I review some of my favorite studies of allergic rhinitis and the influenza viruses, which cause the common cold and flu.\nViruses are tiny, almost microscopic organisms. Viruses can even be seen only in a microscope called an electron microscope. An electron, that is.\nAntivirals such as Amantadine, Foscarnet, and Ganciclovir are useful in the treatment of other types of viruses. They work by either stopping viruses from reproducing or helping the body's immune system to combat the virus. These drugs can't always attack the viruses that cause diseases such coughs and sore throats. Antihistamines are not the same as antimalarial drugs, although both can make people have allergies in different ways. Many antihistoamines can increase the risk of HIV by 10-fold.\nAllergies develop gradually. Over time, it becomes more difficult to breathe because the airways, throat, sinuses and other parts of your body swell up with water, making breathing harder. Allergic rhinopharytistis (a type of inflammation and rash of a similar kind as rosacea) develops when the skin and nerves react to allergens, including dust, mites, molds, pollen or other contaminants.\nDiseases caused by viruses such viruses are called viruses because they can easily enter the nervous system and travel along nerves into your sinusses, causing disease and damage. There are many types each kind of rhinositis (such as allergic rash, rhinoconjunctivitis, roscea, herpes, or the \"common cold\"). Most rhiniotis infections are caused viruses or fungi such fungal infections or rosaceas. It can be a cold, but sometimes it can also be an allergic reaction. Rhinopleus (or \"dry eyes\") happens when allergen trigger symptoms that don't require treatment. For example, many people are allergic to cats when they enter a room that contains cats. This isn't necessary. Other problems might need help from your allergist that you can read about", "Why it needs to be diagnosed and treated correctly\nInfectious mononucleosis is a serious form of viral infection, but people can\u2019t always distinguish it from viral stomatitis.

However, the degree of severity varies and may even require medical treatment. Skin problems are usually not serious, but can pose a social problem or sometimes even be potentially life-threatening. In most cases, self-treatment is ineffective, and a physician must be consulted. There are a number of conditions that affect the skin. The most common skin problems include acne, scars from old acne lesions, eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, vitiligo and keratoacanthoma. It is also normal to have skin infections at times. Keratotic acanthomas are caused by a proliferation of epidermal cells. This type of tumor is considered to be a benign growth. At first, most people find the presence of this condition to appear as an ordinary raised growth in the subcutaneous tissue. Since it does not cause pain or discomfort, unless you know if is causing any complications or is not responding well to medical treatments, you do not need to concern yourself about the situation or undergo any skin procedures. Usually, keratoses are treated to ease any symptoms of disfigurement, pain, or skin sensitivity. Sometimes, your physician will want you to undergo the procedure to prevent complications, such as cancer. If you want to find a good dermatologist in Hyderabad, visit Lybrate today and get expert advice on skin related issues.\nThe skin, which is the largest organ of our body, is extremely important. For this, it is essential to maintain its health. Otherwise, we might come down with a lot of diseases in our lives. Dermatologists can be considered saviours when we are facing any such problem. But, one should take care of skin properly to avoid getting skin diseases. To be precise, our skin is directly linked to our internal well-being. Therefore, there are some skin conditions such that they develop due to poor health habits. Some of those conditions are discussed below. Psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by red, scaly patches and thick skin lesions which occur when our immune system produces abnormal cells that form thick patches on the surface of your skin and on your nails. Another skin infection is Eczema. Caused due of environmental factors, this can cause intense itching and blistering and the inflammation in which the rash appears is made worse by rubbing or excessive scratching", "If yes whats the success rate?\nLets say its just for show. I just want to have some smooth skin.", "If yes,why isnt it used by dermatologists in place of the conventional kerastat lotion?\nDear Anmol,\nKP (keratotic pila)is a common condition occurring in around 40% of population.\nIt\u2019s an area of rough dry scaling skin (papules) due to excess keratin (hair protein)and sometimes follicular plugging, which is caused by an inherited abnormality of kerinisation and is due mainly to a lack of lipophilic enzymes in dermal cells.\nWhile it may have a genetic association (familial history), there is no cure but many methods to temporarily improve its appearance. The most popular and known one is the Vaniqa cream (Eflornithin) which unfortunately can cause unwanted androgenic side effects like facial hirsuitism, acne, breast tenderness, headache etc. In my case a 5% retinoid cream helps me to reduce the number of papules and also give a nice moisturizing glow to my skin.

She said that the hormones in my body were not working right and that is why I miscarried. So I guess it could be the cause of your miscarages.\nYou should talk to your doctor about it. Good luck.\nYes, there is a strong genetic link to PCOD. If you have it, your daughter will have an 80% chance of having it as well.\nPCOD is caused by a hormonal imbalance. Your body produces too much testosterone and not enough estrogen. This causes the ovaries to not release an egg each month. Instead, the egg stays in your ovarie and grows into a cyst. You can have one or many cysts. These cyst can be as small as a pea or as big as an orange. They can also be painful.\nThe only way to know if you really have this condition is to have your blood tested. There are several tests that can determine if your body is producing too many male hormones. One of them is called the DHEA test. Another is the testosterone test.\nIf you do have the condition, you can take medication to help regulate your hormones and make it easier for you to get pregnant.", "my other 2 siblings are also going to start a family and I would hate to say we had a problem conceivng because of the genetic factor.\nAlso my sister's daughter is pre-diabetic.

I always wondered if there was a possibility I could get it too. What about other reproductive issues? Is anything hereditary?\nA. Yes, heredity does play a part in PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease)\nThe exact cause of PCO and other ovarian defects is unclear. However, recent studies have provided strong evidence that ovarian diseases are genetic in nature and possibly linked to the same gene (the FSHB gene) that causes some cases of Male Hypogonadism (testicular dysgenesis). Studies have found that family members of men with male hypogonation (Low levels of Testosterone in the blood) show signs of increased ovarian dysfunction in women.\nPCOS is seen in many related families, but the trait is not inherited in a simple Mendelian way, which is the classical way of transmitting single genes. Instead, a particular combination of factors from both parents are needed to produce PCOM in daughters.\nHow does PCOP manifest in family member?:\n  1. An increasing number of related family will have increased weight gain and weight problems.\n \u00a02. Increasing number will be obese.\n\u00a03. Related families may show increased resistance to insulin\n\u00a04.\u00a0Many have enlarged ovaries.\n\u00a0Frequently, there is only one family of sisters.\nOther female\u00a0 Reproductive Problems that might be inherited.\nI would love to share more about this subject, however, this is limited to 200 words.\nPCOD Treatment \u2013 How Can I Improve My Chances Of Having A Baby?

In fact, most don't develop it. Those who are the most susceptible have certain genetic factors that make them more susceptible. These are different for everyone. Some families do tend to have high rates of PCO, but there is not just one genetic factor that is responsible.", "And if so does that mean that if my sister cannot be treated for pco's it could be passed down to me as well? Thanks\nThere is not a strong history of this as a family condition. It is a disorder of hormone regulation but this may have a hereditary component.

I also have facial hair and acne but don't get a period until 2-3 weeks later. Am I at risk? What can I do to prevent or treat pco's?\nMost people with PCOS are genetically predisposed to it, but it\u2019s not inherited. PCO or PCOD (Polycystic ovary disease) is usually noticed around puberty or at the turn of adult age, when females start missing their periods or it becomes irregular. This disorder mainly affects females in their fertile years.\nWomen with the disorder have increased levels of androgen, a male hormone that interferes with ovulation. Androgens are produced by both in men and women. These androgences or androgestrone can interfere with normal ovarian activity.\nPCOS appears to run in families, and it is thought that it may have a complex genetic basis. Many women with close family members who have PCOs have the condition themselves. Most women who are diagnosed with diabetes at a young age are also found to have polycastic ovaries. It is estimated that about 20 % of young female diabectics with symptoms and features of pcss have family history.\nThe main risk factor for PCos is being overweight. Weight loss can help with weight gain, acne, facial and body hair, abnormal periods and fertility problems. A combination of regular exercise and well- balanced, low-fat diet might help some of the conditions linked with it. But exercise alone or diet alone may not be sufficient to cure it completely.\nSome researches have suggested that there is a link between low intake of vitamin D and PCoS. Low vitamin-D has been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Though the results are controversial, it does seem vitamin and sunlight could help in management of PC0 but needs to be proven.\nIf you are overweight then consult a nutritionist and exercise regularly. If you have diabetes or diabetes in your family, then regularly monitor your blood sugar levels."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5909, "rouge1_r": 0.0762, "rouge1_f1": 0.1351, "rouge2_p": 0.1628, "rouge2_r": 0.0206, "rouge2_f1": 0.0366, "rougel_p": 0.3864, "rougel_r": 0.0499, "rougel_f1": 0.0883, "bleurt": 0.3061, "bert_score_p": 0.794, "bert_score_r": 0.8533, "bert_score_f1": 0.8226, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.1618, "rouge1_f1": 0.2444, "rouge2_p": 0.0233, "rouge2_r": 0.0074, "rouge2_f1": 0.0112, "rougel_p": 0.2045, "rougel_r": 0.0662, "rougel_f1": 0.1, "bleurt": 0.2889, "bert_score_p": 0.8123, "bert_score_r": 0.8451, "bert_score_f1": 0.8284, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5909, "rouge1_r": 0.0925, "rouge1_f1": 0.16, "rouge2_p": 0.0465, "rouge2_r": 0.0071, "rouge2_f1": 0.0124, "rougel_p": 0.3409, "rougel_r": 0.0534, "rougel_f1": 0.0923, "bleurt": 0.276, "bert_score_p": 0.7923, "bert_score_r": 0.8677, "bert_score_f1": 0.8283, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3636, "rouge1_r": 0.2353, "rouge1_f1": 0.2857, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1591, "rougel_r": 0.1029, "rougel_f1": 0.125, "bleurt": 0.2956, "bert_score_p": 0.8624, "bert_score_r": 0.8842, "bert_score_f1": 0.8732, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5909, "rouge1_r": 0.0855, "rouge1_f1": 0.1494, "rouge2_p": 0.093, "rouge2_r": 0.0132, "rouge2_f1": 0.0231, "rougel_p": 0.3409, "rougel_r": 0.0493, "rougel_f1": 0.0862, "bleurt": 0.2549, "bert_score_p": 0.787, "bert_score_r": 0.8591, "bert_score_f1": 0.8215, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.7273, "rouge1_r": 0.0914, "rouge1_f1": 0.1624, "rouge2_p": 0.2093, "rouge2_r": 0.0258, "rouge2_f1": 0.0459, "rougel_p": 0.4773, "rougel_r": 0.06, "rougel_f1": 0.1066, "bleurt": 0.313, "bert_score_p": 0.7974, "bert_score_r": 0.8692, "bert_score_f1": 0.8318, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}]}

Any ideas?\nHere at the Podiatry Center of New Jersey, we frequently encounter cases of toenail and skin infections due to fungus. They can cause thickening and dark discoloration of your toenails, cracking and peeling of skin, and sometimes even pain and discomfort. If you have such a condition, you should seek treatment as soon as possible.\nHere are three facts about toenailer fungus that you may or may not already know:\n1. It can affect your overall health. Certain types of fungal infections, like onychomycosis, can also spread to your heart and lungs. That\u2019s right, the fungus can enter your bloodstream and travel throughout your body.\n2. Medications are the best thing to use for toenaler fungus, not natural cures. We recommend oral medicine prescribed by your doctor for fungal conditions. However, if you choose to treat your condition at home yourself, it actually won\u2019t work. In an article by WebMD, Dr. Michael J. Breisch, a dermatologist at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, states, \u201cAny of these popular treatments [laser therapy, vinegar, tea tree oil] are not going to get rid of onycomyosis.\u201d\n3. Fungus can be transmitted from person to person. Many people with this condition may think that they can pass it along to another person, accidentally spread the spores to others while walking around a locker room floor or while sharing personal items like socks and towels, but there\u2019s a good chance that\u2019s not true. A study published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal proved, through a group experiment on 20 individuals, that the transmission of fungus is unlikely. But this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. Another study suggested that fungus in locker rooms may actually be resistant to topical treatments, so you can easily pick it up. The best way to avoid transmission is actually to keep yourself clean and use proper medication for the infection, avoiding self-treatment methods\nToenail fungus doesn't just affect one individual: according to a survey from the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA), more than 10 million American adults have toenial fungus right now. You can fight it, though, with a prescription from our doctors.

Here are some natural remedies to help prevent this.\nNSAIAs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They are used to treat pain and inflammation. Some examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin. These drugs are commonly used for headaches, menstrual cramps, arthritis, muscle aches, back pain, and other types of pain.\nWhile NSAID drugs can be effective for treating pain in some cases, they also have some serious side effects. One of the most common side effect of these drugs is stomach upset. This can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain or cramping, gas, bloating, or indigestion.\nIf you are taking NSAIDS and are experiencing stomach problems, there are several natural ways to reduce the irritation and discomfort. In this article, I\u2019ll share some of my favorite natural solutions for preventing stomach issues from NSAIA drugs.\nWhat Are NSAIs?\nNSIAIDs are drugs that are often used as pain relievers. The most commonly known NSAI is aspirins. Other NSAIS include naprosyn, ibuprin, indomethacin, ketoprofen and diclofenac. NSAAs work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause inflammation and pain. Prostaglandin production is increased in response to injury or infection. By blocking prostglanding production, NSAAS reduce inflammation, swelling and fever.\nThe most serious risk of taking an NSAAD is that it can increase the risk for heart attack and stroke. If you have a history of heart disease or stroke, you should not take an NSAA. Also, if you take blood thinners, such as warfarin, aspiran, clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, do not use an NAA.\nOther side affects of NSAs include stomach ulcers, bleeding in the stomach or intestines, kidney problems and liver damage. People who are allergic to aspira should avoid taking any NSA. Pregnant women should also avoid NSA.\nHow Do NSAids Cause Stomach Problems?\nThe stomach is a very sensitive organ. It is lined with a mucous membrane that protects it from the harsh acids that digest food. When this mucosal lining is damaged, it", "There are several over the counter medications available for those who have difficulty with NSAID ulcer risk and are unwilling (or unable to) make the change to a COX-2 inhibitor. In order for medication to be a helpful prophylactic or prevent an NSAIDs risk of stomach ulcer formation, it has to work differently than an ordinary pain reliever or anti-inflammatory by neutralizing stomach acid. This function can come in a few varieties, both over-the-counter and prescription, but the most frequently suggested is a histamine blocker or H2 blocker like ranitidine or cimetidine (trade names Zantac and Tagamet). These two medications work by blocking the release of histamines in the stomach and therefore reducing gastric acid secretion. Histamines are chemicals that when released stimulate the secretion of fluids in which stomach cells digest their own dead protein which forms gastric ulcers. So H- blockers can be very helpful in reducing the gastric irritation associated with taking NSAIDS. It is not likely however, that these medications will resolve acid related ulcer symptoms. If you find that your ulcer symptoms are not improving on these kinds of medications, you should look into a proton-pump inhibitor or PPI like Nexium or Prevacid. Prolonged use of PPsI\u2019s may be associated in some people with an increase bone fracture risk.

My Dr prescribed Ibuprofin 800mg, 3 times a day and Cipro. Is that OK, and is it safe to take them long-term? If I cannot take NSAIDs for my back injury pain what other pain medication could my Dr prescribe?\nYes NSAIS does bother the stomach and I have something that you could take as well. An NSAIA would be aspirin. Aspirin has a anti-inflammatory action as NSAIBS do. However sometimes aspirins can irritate the GI (gastrointestinal tract) as do NSAIs. So there is a particular medication I would rather like you to try. That is Methyl-Bismuth. These are available at all pharmacies and there are many generic products for the same drug. MBE works by reducing the secretion of gastric juices that are secreted by the cells in the upper digestive tract. The medication is used for all kinds of upper GIT (or gastrointestinal) conditions. For example gastric and duodenal ulcers, GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux disorder), dyspepsia, or heartburn, pain. Other medications that may be of interest would include cimetidine, famotidine and ranitidine. Cimetadine is probably the oldest but it can cause adverse reactions to liver function. Ranitadimne is more tolerable by many patients and famatidine is perhaps less so\nThere are four medications for inflammation with NSAI (non steroidal anti inflammatory medications) characteristics in them. Three are listed in your text and it is not necessary to describe here. In your example where you asked whether aspirina does not irritates the GIT you are referring to aspirinas that have acetyl salicylic in it. Those are usually low in salicily content and therefore they are better tolerated but not as good in reducing inflammation as other medications. Thus the three alternatives would involve ibubronophin (brand Ibprofin), indometacin (Indocid) and naphroxeen (Naproxic).\nI", "\u2013 UMMC\nIs there any medicine to help my son deal with nausea when he is in the hospital?

HG is related to hyperemesis gravidarum and is a severe illness that causes inaccessibility to foods and drinks with extreme queasy episodes. While hypermesis gravidrum can go without any problems, it can likewise cause dehydration for the mother-to be.\nDuring pregnancy the stomach acid produced when you spit up can cause heart burns; this can be brought on by the weight of your expanding uterus pushing on your stomach and moving it up.

They never really give you the right information, and they are only used for profit.\nAs a teenager, I am very susceptible to the media. I would probably read every website and every article about Covid. And as a curious 17-year-old with no real knowledge, of course, the website looked like it had the actual answer to end the pandemic. However, they just lead you down a rabbit hole of more information that will only raise more questions. As a parent, my fear is you will not be able to distinguish between real information and incorrect information. The same thing as when I got my first phone and I had to start going through my social sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok to know these apps were not the real way to solve Covid-19.\nIn conclusion, we all know that some sites, TV programs, social posts, articles or videos have more misinformation than actual information because the creators of such platforms only want clicks to make money.\u00a0 But I think that the government and the people should understand that no one is a hero and only try to help without a profit. Because if the creator of those information pages is trying to find attention by publishing articles on the news for the COVID pandemic, then no wonder you end up not having enough information on Covid and not knowing what to do in that situation.\nBy: Gabriella J.", "According to the CDC, some COVID-19 symptoms are cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include:\nDiarrhea & Nausea\nPeculiar taste or smell loss\nThis information is correct as per the US Center for Disease Control.\nWhy Does The Virus Cause Naus...\nVomiting is a potential symptom of COVID. When vomit occurs, it can lead to fluid loss and dehydration. As the virus spreads in an infectious way, the stomach and intestines can become inflamed and upset. That can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, & abdominal pain. If you are dealing with symptoms that last longer than a few days, try contacting a doctor in your area. There are some things that you can do to alleviate the discomfort. Here are six things to remember.\n  1. It is essential to stay hydrated. COVID related vomiting can result in diarrhea. Dehydration is an issue if you have a problem with the flu. This doesn\u2019t just refer to staying hydrated to replace water lost from vomiting. For any infection it is important to drink plenty of fluids. Keep a bottle of water close to your bed and drink it continuously throughout the day.\n2. Stay away from the cause of your illness in case you suspect that an illness brought on by COVID was caused by food. Try to keep away of that kind of food, including dairy products. They can be difficult to digest because you could be vomiting and diarrhea when dealing. Also do not take laxatives to treat vomiting or diarrhea as they can make your condition worse. You should also refrain from consuming alcohol during this time to remain hydrated.\n3. Eat food gradually in small amounts. Avoid eating junk food since it contains sugar and salt that can trigger the need for more liquid in the body. Instead, opt for fresh fruits and fruits. Do not be too concerned if your appetite is low. However, you should eat something. A high caloric intake will provide your body with essential energy and nutrients to heal.\n4. Utilize an anti-emetic drug. Antihistamine drugs are the most effective to combat nausea. In the event that your medication doesn't work to help stop the nausea it might be time for you to consult with your physician on the best method to control nausea caused due to COVID.\n5. Don't take too long. Take breaks from being active however, don\u2019t be idle. An active body is more likely to have nausea problems. Make sure you try an activity like", "\u2013 Health\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update its data on COVID symptoms every week. Right now the CDC states that nausea or vomiting is not a symptom of coronavirus. Instead of listing the symptom, it says, \u201cThe only symptoms currently listed are fever, chills, repeated shaking with chattering teeth, muscle pain, sore throat, fatigue, or new loss of taste or smell, while the rest of the symptoms listed as potential COVID-19 symptoms were \u201cnot reported in the scientific literature\u201d. \u201c.\nIt\u2019s unclear what scientific studies the agency used to remove nausea and vomiting from its list of symptoms, since no studies of thousands of people with COVID have been published.\nThe CDC has been criticized for its slow rollout of data about potential long-term symptoms. In August, the Mayo Clinic published a large study of 3,000 Americans suffering from COVID infection. They found that gastrointestinal symptoms affected about 50% of COVID patients. These include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About 20% suffered from heartburn, according to the report.\nMayo Clinic doctors said their results indicate that GI and other symptoms are the result of a complex immune response from the virus. \u201cWe found a high rate of gastrointestinal, respiratory and even cardiac symptoms in a cohort of [COVID] patients, which suggests that the infection may not be limited to a single organ or system,\u201d they said in August.\nThere are now several studies that indicate a connection between coronavirus and the digestive system. An American Institute of Medicine study found the coronavirus in intestinal tissue from four deceased COVID victims. Researchers at the University of Arizona took samples from 22 patients infected with the new coronavirus, including nine deceased. The study results were reported on October 27. Seven out of ten of those who died had coronavirus material in their intestines, along with their lungs.\nDoctors agree that if you have COVID, you are likely to have digestive problems in other ways. People with this virus can have severe and chronic diarrhea. For the most part, those symptoms subside quickly.\nIf you\u2019re experiencing nausea that goes beyond just food poisoning or general \u201cfood is spoiled\u201d, you probably have a more serious problem. Seek a medical professional to determine the cause.\nIn the meantime, don\u2019t waste time trying to figure out what\u2019s causing your discomfort. If your food is bad, just go a day without eating. Throw whatever you can away and wash whatever cooking utensils you used. Wait a full day for the nausea to subdue", "No I just have a sore throat? Can you give me a test to make sure it\u2019s not Covid? Do Covid tests check if you have Covid 19?\nThese are just some of the questions people on the frontline of NHS call handling are faced with when dealing with people calling in concerned about whether they have coronavirus, or indeed if a family member has been tested or have it.\nThe Covid-19 crisis is an extraordinary times, and with the lockdown that has just been announced by Boris Johnson as well as new restrictions to come in place, call centres across the country will be inundated with a raft of calls from those worried about coronavirus. It remains difficult to pinpoint where a cold can turn into a cough, to see the signs of an underlying health problem, with many people not even knowing they might possess a health condition that could make them especially exposed to the virus.\u00a0 Therefore the people dealing day in day out with anxious members of local communities deserve the most up to date information possible, even without being equipped medical professionals.\nOn top of this, dealing in a call centre environment can bring another set of issues. There is the increased risk of getting an infection from members coming and going from local call centers. Those that are not being kept away have to deal with large numbers of members that will no doubt be coughing and may have even been in close proximity of someone with Covid. At the same time you may even have people taking advice that hasn\u2019t really been taken on board.\nSome people won\u2019t want to go outside because they are anxious about who they may come into contact with, whereas others may not want anyone in their homes because of exposure fears. On top this call handlers are also under increased pressure with higher call volumes, increased levels of anxiety, high staff turnover because you cannot allow anyone to get too sick, this has caused call center staff to have their mental health put under pressure, something that is not only detrimental in itself but could also decrease their ability to help others.\nWhat is needed is more training, access to a more robust flow of information for call-handling staff and the ability for them to know whether this information has actually got through to callers."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5667, "rouge1_r": 0.0929, "rouge1_f1": 0.1596, "rouge2_p": 0.1379, "rouge2_r": 0.022, "rouge2_f1": 0.0379, "rougel_p": 0.3, "rougel_r": 0.0492, "rougel_f1": 0.0845, "bleurt": 0.3414, "bert_score_p": 0.8038, "bert_score_r": 0.8614, "bert_score_f1": 0.8316, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.6667, "rouge1_r": 0.0457, "rouge1_f1": 0.0855, "rouge2_p": 0.1724, "rouge2_r": 0.0114, "rouge2_f1": 0.0215, "rougel_p": 0.4, "rougel_r": 0.0274, "rougel_f1": 0.0513, "bleurt": 0.3383, "bert_score_p": 0.785, "bert_score_r": 0.8607, "bert_score_f1": 0.8211, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4667, "rouge1_r": 0.0449, "rouge1_f1": 0.0819, "rouge2_p": 0.1034, "rouge2_r": 0.0096, "rouge2_f1": 0.0176, "rougel_p": 0.3667, "rougel_r": 0.0353, "rougel_f1": 0.0643, "bleurt": 0.3165, "bert_score_p": 0.7933, "bert_score_r": 0.8304, "bert_score_f1": 0.8114, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.6333, "rouge1_r": 0.0451, "rouge1_f1": 0.0843, "rouge2_p": 0.1724, "rouge2_r": 0.0119, "rouge2_f1": 0.0223, "rougel_p": 0.4667, "rougel_r": 0.0333, "rougel_f1": 0.0621, "bleurt": 0.3182, "bert_score_p": 0.7907, "bert_score_r": 0.8552, "bert_score_f1": 0.8217, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6667, "rouge1_r": 0.0471, "rouge1_f1": 0.0879, "rouge2_p": 0.2069, "rouge2_r": 0.0142, "rouge2_f1": 0.0265, "rougel_p": 0.4333, "rougel_r": 0.0306, "rougel_f1": 0.0571, "bleurt": 0.3307, "bert_score_p": 0.8011, "bert_score_r": 0.8623, "bert_score_f1": 0.8306, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4667, "rouge1_r": 0.0347, "rouge1_f1": 0.0647, "rouge2_p": 0.069, "rouge2_r": 0.005, "rouge2_f1": 0.0093, "rougel_p": 0.4, "rougel_r": 0.0298, "rougel_f1": 0.0554, "bleurt": 0.3126, "bert_score_p": 0.7877, "bert_score_r": 0.8332, "bert_score_f1": 0.8098, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

This is related to the inner ear.\nThanks so much for your comment. The information has been replaced. We hope this resolves your confusion!", "I tried searching on the internet but couldn't find an answer.\nThe cause of Vestibular Neuritis is currently unknown. There are two possible explanations that are currently being researched. The inner ear is connected to the brainstem. Studies suggest that it is possible for the viruses (such as herpes viruses) that can affect the inner, middle, and outer ear, to migrate to this nerve and infect it. Vestibuular neuritis can occur as a result of a virus or bacteria infection in the ear. Some scientists believe that any form of infection (bacterial or viral) may lead to Vestibalur Neuiritis.\nIn Vestibilaur Neuitis, there is an inflammation of the vestibulae nerve, which runs from the semi-circular canals of each ear to control the motion and balance of your body. This results in dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance. It is usually treated with motion therapy and medications and can be prevented by being sure to get your vaccinations, especially your routine tetanus shots.\nWhat is acute vestibularr neurinits?", "The vestibule area is in your inner ear\nIt has three little cilia and when it is irritated, it sends false messages to your body regarding balancing your center of gravity. As you can imagine, this is really irritating to the body. Your ears, head, neck, jaw, shoulders, even your eyes and brain all feel the effects. The symptoms can be severe dizziness and vertigo, ear ringing, unbalance, pressure in the ears and head and you may feel like you have the flu.\nThe first thing I would do is get a hearing test so we could eliminate a real ear infection. It seems to be a trend when people suffer from a prolonged illness and are on the weaker side of the illness. We seem to feel better in no time, as the brain needs more energy and we begin to eat and get more healthy. What happens to some though, they suffer the after effects of poor circulation and weakened immune system when they get re-infected over and over again.\nThese are the type of cases I see, so I encourage my clients to rest when tired and to make sure they take care of their bodies by getting more sleep, resting and eating well. I personally like to buy my own supplements over the counter, just for a couple of months. Some I suggest are, Fish oil, a good vitamin c, and calcium and magnesium. But as always, you should consult a doctor to ensure these supplements are appropriate for your needs.\nMy goal is to show you how to gently manipulate your neck back in alignment to help reduce the pressure on your ears. That is one of nature's best secrets to helping the organs in our bodies when we get congested. They are very wise this way. When we sleep we lie backwards on gravity and in that position our body does the work for us, getting oxygen to every cell in its pathway in just one night. So do that, sleep or rest in a position on all fours to work the congestion free. There are several positions I teach them to try so that you could find the one that works best for you.\nAnother thing you might try is a sinus or Eustascian tube treatment (ear candling). The Ears are attached to sinuses. You just have to find a gentle and safe practitioner and ask questions before allowing them access to one the most precious parts of our anatomy.", "?\nVestibular nerve pathology is the most common cause of spontaneous, recurrent vertigo. The symptoms are generally similar to those of vestibulopathy, but are not associated with head trauma or otologic disease. Spontaneous attacks of vertiginous, with other vestibulo-ocular symptoms such as imbalance and oscillopsia, may occur as either an isolated symptom or alternatively in association with auditory symptoms and signs. Common clinical associations of the latter are with chronic relapsing demyelinating disease and autoimmune conditions. Although the cause in many cases is poorly understood, an autoimmune basis is suspected in a number of patients.\nThe diagnosis of chronic idiopathic vestibulpopathy or Meniere's disease is made on the basis of a cluster of symptoms, signs, and test results. In chronic vestibullor neuritis, the clinical presentation is characterized by persistent symptoms of imbalance, often with coexisting visual and oculomototll defects. This syndrome is associated most closely with multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Cerebral lesions, however, are increasingly considered to be an important cause for many patients with the syndrome. It is suggested that, in the absence of other objective neuro-otological signs that indicate a central cause, a more favorable prognosis can be expected in those with an idiopathile picture.\nVermulek C, Klockhoff I, Bergstrom B.

Anyways, my thoughts are that if I can stay off medication, I'll be much better off. But we will have to weigh the risks with the benefits. Either way, if medication is necessary, than I say so be it as long as it's taken care of!!\nYes, we are all in a similar position in life, looking for answers, sometimes we think we have the answer but then the answers change, it\u2019s a struggle, a puzzle, but if it was easy then we wouldn\u2019t have discovered ourselves to be the incredible individuals we truly are. And yes \u201cevery person has their own story to tell\u201d. Thank you so very much. You have been really kind to offer your support, you truly have a generous heart. Yes, that is one reason why I like this forum is being able to express yourself, even if some are more understanding than others. In most cases people offer their support and opinions in love and kindness. That's awesome! And I really like our \u201cspecial powers\u201d.\nOh, don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not giving up", "I feel like I'm starting to get some and I don't want to suffer on some painful, scratchy, bleeding thing over time. I've got work to do, man!\nI don\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable so I would definitely go down to the pharmacy, talk to your pharmacist, maybe ask for a referral to see who the physicians or nurse practitioners are at the clinic. And I definitely would go and have that examined as I said it is something that is very very common for pregnant individuals, also for people in general, and it can always be treated. It would be better to know that you have it, understand how it\u2019s going to affect you throughout your pregnancy and know how you\u2019re going get help through the best treatment possible.\nHi there, we have two more questions for you today. Oh, yeah, I actually do have a question. Just another unrelated question regarding hair care and hair dye. As far as the safety of hair colors on dark hair, they say they use different ingredients, as opposed to light colored hair. So, for the last fifteen years, my natural dark colored (black), has been light, ash brown on the left side and light ash blond on top and on right side where my part begins, due to a chemical damage at age of 26. My questions are is it better and safer to keep those colors (I\u2019ve only been doing this since I found out I was pregnant) or should I just go all the way back to my darker color due the current state of my scalp and all, not knowing what has happened. Thank you!\nHi, so really it's a very personal choice in the type of dye that are you using. Because if you are looking for like ash colors you want, well, very specific types of color. But there are so many different brands and some of them are better than others. Of course there is always a risk, but it will minimize. If you use permanent dyes, a lot of times some people use things like the henna, like for temporary color and a great way to kind of lighten your color if that's what you're looking to achieve. Again it comes down with what's the right choice for your personal hair type, what type you used to have already, the risk you feel comfortable with, or do you prefer not to color your hair at all and your natural hair color is fine. That's up to you, it really comes to those"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.2447, "rouge1_r": 0.2447, "rouge1_f1": 0.2447, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.117, "rougel_r": 0.117, "rougel_f1": 0.117, "bleurt": 0.2729, "bert_score_p": 0.8464, "bert_score_r": 0.8185, "bert_score_f1": 0.8322, "hallucination": 10.0, "comprehensive": 88.88888888888889}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.0638, "rouge1_r": 0.2069, "rouge1_f1": 0.0976, "rouge2_p": 0.0108, "rouge2_r": 0.0357, "rouge2_f1": 0.0165, "rougel_p": 0.0426, "rougel_r": 0.1379, "rougel_f1": 0.065, "bleurt": 0.1802, "bert_score_p": 0.8642, "bert_score_r": 0.8124, "bert_score_f1": 0.8375, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 44.44444444444444}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.117, "rouge1_r": 0.1294, "rouge1_f1": 0.1229, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0745, "rougel_r": 0.0824, "rougel_f1": 0.0782, "bleurt": 0.2208, "bert_score_p": 0.83, "bert_score_r": 0.8075, "bert_score_f1": 0.8186, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 22.22222222222222}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.234, "rouge1_r": 0.2366, "rouge1_f1": 0.2353, "rouge2_p": 0.0215, "rouge2_r": 0.0217, "rouge2_f1": 0.0216, "rougel_p": 0.0957, "rougel_r": 0.0968, "rougel_f1": 0.0963, "bleurt": 0.2373, "bert_score_p": 0.8099, "bert_score_r": 0.8167, "bert_score_f1": 0.8133, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 22.22222222222222}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3723, "rouge1_r": 0.0803, "rouge1_f1": 0.1321, "rouge2_p": 0.043, "rouge2_r": 0.0092, "rouge2_f1": 0.0152, "rougel_p": 0.2128, "rougel_r": 0.0459, "rougel_f1": 0.0755, "bleurt": 0.289, "bert_score_p": 0.7883, "bert_score_r": 0.8171, "bert_score_f1": 0.8024, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 11.11111111111111}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3723, "rouge1_r": 0.0794, "rouge1_f1": 0.1308, "rouge2_p": 0.0108, "rouge2_r": 0.0023, "rouge2_f1": 0.0038, "rougel_p": 0.2128, "rougel_r": 0.0454, "rougel_f1": 0.0748, "bleurt": 0.2542, "bert_score_p": 0.7831, "bert_score_r": 0.8096, "bert_score_f1": 0.7961, "hallucination": 70.0, "comprehensive": 22.22222222222222}]}

It has to become really high before I call my doctor. If it stays lower than a certain level that is OK by me.\nHi, good to hear from you! I understand what you are saying, I've had high bloodpressure almost my whole life. I had an angiogram done, and found out just one of my arteries was almost completely blocked. Now on the low BP medication.\nYou can't ask yourself to stay at home when the feeling comes on or that you aren't a good person when you have it. Because it isn't within your control. Like I said before it looks better on you when others know. You can tell your doc about the medication and let them know it's not working, they can put you on other meds or something else that will work. The only other option is a hospital stay, when your body is in such a state it will be hard for you to not see the other options open to you.\nIt's normal for the BP to be different day to day, just have someone check it and find average with each check. Make sure to ask for a written log for yourself too. When you feel good write it down, make sure you get your BP down each day so you can continue working.\nThe doctor is your friend.\nThanks for responding, yes I think I know how you work I'm sure there are many others with our conditions in your district.\nI had been on a different drug for several years it worked for me and the only side effect was some swelling and my fingers and face being puffy.

I just dont know any other way, to do this.\nThe blood clinics is a good idea.\nBut as with everything, blood isn't an exact science. There are lots of factors that affect your bloodpressure.\nFirstly it should be taken at the same time, best is to set an alarm then no excuses for you or anyone else.\nSecondly, you should take it while sitting. If you're working it's not practical, so best to take the measurements while you are on a break.\nIf you take these measurements every 2 weeks (in between them you can take your BP at home) you will get good comparision values. However a few days here and there makes no sense.\nIt should stay less than 120 / 80 - this is the normal bp.\nAt a bp of 140 /90 the risk of a stroke is increased by a factor > 1 (10%), so if you have a long way to go, it is better to measure bloodglucose, this gives the chance to change some habits.\nWhen i was on the 800 Calorie Soup Diet, my BP dropped from 165 over 125 (I am a type 4 diabetic also) to 116 over about 70. The diet was 1000 calories a day, with plenty of lean meat, low fat dairy, legumes and veggies. As a matter of fact, when I was finally ready and able to start exercising again, during the last 15 or 20 pounds, the doctor didn't even take a BP test, and when he tried, he couldn't feel my pulse. It was just gone. So I haven't had to have one since.\nMy mother never had blood-pressure problems her whole life. 3 years ago when she was diagnosed with COPD, we were told she would need to lose 30lbs and her blood-pessure went from normal to elevated in a very short period of time. When we started the soup she lost that 28lbs, her lungs cleared up, all the drugs and supplements she took disappeared, she dropped back down to normal.\nSince that year she never has had a problem with blood pesssure.\nI can tell when my bloodpessuer is elevated it makes it harder for me to breathe, but when it goes back to the right level, breathing is much easier and I can get the most out", "And for how long?\nAnd, of course, I should look at the kids blood sugars also. How often and for long???\nThese are the tests we want you to do at home if your child has recently had a kidney biopsy at UCLA. They are also helpful for children when they are in the hospital or clinic when the doctor is trying to get a picture of how things are doing.\nDo the Blood Pressure Tests 2 times every day at random intervals. It is very important that you do it at least 5 times a day, more is better. After a while you will become quite good at getting reasonably accurate readings. Do these tests at Home before meals, after meals and maybe at bedtime.\nPut the cuff on correctly. Measure the upper part of the arm at a location where there is no fatty layer or boney lump. This will avoid errors.\nTo measure blood pressue use the BP machines that are automatic. The ones with a stethoscope are not as dependable.\nUse your machines for a few practice readings before you start collecting data.\nWrite the time, the pressure and the number of tries that it took to make a good reading.\nWe will look specifically at 4 numbers, 3 of them in your childs arm (systolic, diastolic and Pulse), and one called Mean Arterial Pressure in their legs. Let's do a quick lesson on these terms.\nLet's start in 1 arm and then we will move down to the legs.\nSo let me give you some numbers that we can use to explain. We do not say anything about what they mean, but this is good practice. Once we talk about your children's BP the numbers below may be very helpful.\nTake the data below and work it out for these BP numbers.\nThese answers look strange until we do some calculations.\nYour kids systolic pressure will be the highest number.\nDiastoles, or the lower number, is more important in these children, so these numbers will determine the treatment.\nThe pulse, in both upper arms, must be looked at carefully.\nWhy do we look in all 8 legs, and not just one set?\nSometimes the kidney pressure is uneven in each side, we need to take an average from both arms. When it is done correctly the mean values from the arms agree. If they do agree, one number will suffice.\nHow do you read the pressures in a lower leg, where arteries are compressed by the femoral triangle during standing"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.0909, "rouge1_r": 0.2222, "rouge1_f1": 0.129, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.0606, "rougel_r": 0.1481, "rougel_f1": 0.086, "bleurt": 0.2798, "bert_score_p": 0.8471, "bert_score_r": 0.8221, "bert_score_f1": 0.8344, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3788, "rouge1_r": 0.1134, "rouge1_f1": 0.1745, "rouge2_p": 0.0382, "rouge2_r": 0.0114, "rouge2_f1": 0.0175, "rougel_p": 0.2045, "rougel_r": 0.0612, "rougel_f1": 0.0942, "bleurt": 0.2289, "bert_score_p": 0.7834, "bert_score_r": 0.8062, "bert_score_f1": 0.7946, "hallucination": 85.71428571428571, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3333, "rouge1_r": 0.1302, "rouge1_f1": 0.1872, "rouge2_p": 0.0153, "rouge2_r": 0.0059, "rouge2_f1": 0.0085, "rougel_p": 0.1667, "rougel_r": 0.0651, "rougel_f1": 0.0936, "bleurt": 0.2429, "bert_score_p": 0.7895, "bert_score_r": 0.7974, "bert_score_f1": 0.7935, "hallucination": 85.71428571428571, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3939, "rouge1_r": 0.1161, "rouge1_f1": 0.1793, "rouge2_p": 0.0305, "rouge2_r": 0.0089, "rouge2_f1": 0.0138, "rougel_p": 0.2197, "rougel_r": 0.0647, "rougel_f1": 0.1, "bleurt": 0.2822, "bert_score_p": 0.7959, "bert_score_r": 0.8212, "bert_score_f1": 0.8083, "hallucination": 71.42857142857143, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4318, "rouge1_r": 0.1397, "rouge1_f1": 0.2111, "rouge2_p": 0.0687, "rouge2_r": 0.0221, "rouge2_f1": 0.0335, "rougel_p": 0.2197, "rougel_r": 0.0711, "rougel_f1": 0.1074, "bleurt": 0.2376, "bert_score_p": 0.8017, "bert_score_r": 0.8412, "bert_score_f1": 0.821, "hallucination": 57.14285714285714, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5076, "rouge1_r": 0.1565, "rouge1_f1": 0.2393, "rouge2_p": 0.0611, "rouge2_r": 0.0187, "rouge2_f1": 0.0287, "rougel_p": 0.2424, "rougel_r": 0.0748, "rougel_f1": 0.1143, "bleurt": 0.2784, "bert_score_p": 0.8061, "bert_score_r": 0.8434, "bert_score_f1": 0.8243, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

They usually can't treat infections with antibiotics until they know what it is.\nWhat sort of doctor? GP? Specialist?\nIt might be nothing, it might not be, I'd keep an eye on it; but the symptoms described, they don't really sound to scary. Like I said, if it was painful and constant, that'd be different, but even then an ear infection is treatable with strong painkillers.\nBut again, what sort are you? An otologist, an ENT or an GP?\nBut you can have pain from any other infection behind the ear drum - mastoiditis for example.\nI had an episode where I had a few days of pain like that. Pain in the outer ear, and down the jaw and in my teeth - to the extent I took some ibuprofen just so I could sleep through the pain. But my ENT said I didn't have an infection, just a bit of an 'inflammation' from a virus, or allergy or something. He said it could be anything; it wouldn't be an issue.\nIf it had been an actual ear problem, he would've prescribed antibiotics, since he could see that it wasn't a typical ear aching. So if you're going to a GP - ask about antibiotic if that's what you think.\nEar infection - they can appear and disappear as they get better. Also you may well have had the wrong kind of antibiotics before the strep, so it may have been a case of you just needed to finish the course.\nA sore jaw is another symptom of sinusitis (or even a deviated septum, which wouldn\u2019t usually give sinus - but can). The jaw/ teeth ache is a reference point for some viral infections, like glandular fever. My brother had it for 6 weeks at least and was pretty unwell- no infections. Usually symptoms are quite prolonged.\nAnyway it's nothing like serious, unless there's abscess. I've had several episodes where it seemed likely - had some dental issues and got antibiotics from an antibiotic - only to find it nothing to do with the tooth and I was fine, having had streptococcus at a time (probably from my kids) and again more recently.\nAs for GP v specialist- if your GP is able to explain things to you in a way that", "That makes me wonder if I actually did have strep? My doctor said streps are hard to diagnose, because it's not like it shows up immediately in a lab test. I could have still had streptococcus and taken an antibiotic for something else. The antibiotics worked in 2 days! But I still wonder. Haha! It could be a cold, or allergies...I have no idea!\nIt's a throat bacteria! If it went away in two days then what the hell, you were probably just getting better. Don't worry about it!\nI'd say strepthroat is more likely than a bladder infection. Also, the only reason to get tested for streptype is if you want to rule out rheumatic fever, which is VERY serious in kids, but in no way serious unless you are a kid in children's hospital.\nA \"normal\" strepto infection is a quicky as a headcold, and just as treatable with an abx. All other colds need a few days of rest and Tylenol.\nIf you have any further questions you can google streph and kids."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1429, "rouge1_r": 0.2059, "rouge1_f1": 0.1687, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.102, "rougel_r": 0.1471, "rougel_f1": 0.1205, "bleurt": 0.1978, "bert_score_p": 0.8558, "bert_score_r": 0.8338, "bert_score_f1": 0.8446, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3265, "rouge1_r": 0.0696, "rouge1_f1": 0.1147, "rouge2_p": 0.0417, "rouge2_r": 0.0087, "rouge2_f1": 0.0144, "rougel_p": 0.2449, "rougel_r": 0.0522, "rougel_f1": 0.086, "bleurt": 0.2728, "bert_score_p": 0.8033, "bert_score_r": 0.825, "bert_score_f1": 0.814, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.2653, "rouge1_r": 0.1884, "rouge1_f1": 0.2203, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1633, "rougel_r": 0.1159, "rougel_f1": 0.1356, "bleurt": 0.2196, "bert_score_p": 0.8405, "bert_score_r": 0.8464, "bert_score_f1": 0.8434, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4082, "rouge1_r": 0.057, "rouge1_f1": 0.1, "rouge2_p": 0.0625, "rouge2_r": 0.0086, "rouge2_f1": 0.0151, "rougel_p": 0.2857, "rougel_r": 0.0399, "rougel_f1": 0.07, "bleurt": 0.2854, "bert_score_p": 0.785, "bert_score_r": 0.8299, "bert_score_f1": 0.8068, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5102, "rouge1_r": 0.0616, "rouge1_f1": 0.1099, "rouge2_p": 0.0625, "rouge2_r": 0.0074, "rouge2_f1": 0.0132, "rougel_p": 0.3878, "rougel_r": 0.0468, "rougel_f1": 0.0835, "bleurt": 0.2851, "bert_score_p": 0.7839, "bert_score_r": 0.8359, "bert_score_f1": 0.8091, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4082, "rouge1_r": 0.1099, "rouge1_f1": 0.1732, "rouge2_p": 0.0417, "rouge2_r": 0.011, "rouge2_f1": 0.0175, "rougel_p": 0.2653, "rougel_r": 0.0714, "rougel_f1": 0.1126, "bleurt": 0.2807, "bert_score_p": 0.8147, "bert_score_r": 0.8488, "bert_score_f1": 0.8314, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

This condition is usually caused by infections or allergies. The severity of the symptoms of acute conjunctivitis depend on the underlying cause. Bacterial conjunctivitis typically results in a red or pink eye with yellow, green or white discharge that can cause the eyelids to stick together in the morning. The eye is not usually itchy but the discharge is prominent. In viral infections, the eye is also red or pink with minor itching. There may be a burning or irritation sensation, and systemic symptoms like fever, muscle ache, throat ache or cough may be present. Vision is usually not affected in any of the cases. Allergic conjunctivitis is characterized by a pink itchy eye with watery discharge and may also be accompanied by a runny or congested nose.", "Must_have": ["Viral conjunctivitis presents with minor itching.", " Viral conjunctivitis sometimes presents with a burning or irritation sensation.", " Viral conjunctivitis usually presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, muscle ache, throat ache or cough.", " The eye is usually not irritated in bacterial conjunctivitis.", " Bacterial conjunctivitis usually presents with purulent yellow, white or green discharge in the corners of the eyes.", " allergic conjunctivitis usually presents with pink itchy eye with watery discharge.", " Bacterial conjunctivitis could cause the lids to \u2018stuck shut\u2019 in the morning.", " Allergic conjunctivitis is sometimes accompanied by a runny or congested nose."], "Nice_to_have": ["Vision is usually not affected in cases of conjunctivitis."], "Sources": "https://www-uptodate-com.meir.idm.oclc.org/contents/conjunctivitis?search=conjunctivitis&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=1", "ICD_10_diag": null, "sample_predictions": ["I have a 2 year old who has been sick for a week now. He has a runny nose, cough, and a fever. I am wondering if he has pink eyes. What are the other symptoms of pinky eye?", "It isn\u2019t like a pink color on your eye that could be mistaken for a light bruise or acne on the skin that you see and mistake for an eye. So how the hell can the human eye tell the difference between an infection (which is probably painful) and its more benign counterparts?\nSo you have to consider other factors. One of the first signs that may come up, if there\u2019s something wrong with the eye, is a change in the appearance of a lens. Let\u2019s review the different types of eye lenses:\nThe different eye lens types are the cornea, the iris, and the sclera. For a healthy person, these three components should be completely clear. If something were wrong, something could cloud the lens \u2013 like in a severe bruising or chemical burn, for example. There could also be an appearance on a person\u2019s face that\u2019s out of character and you might have suspected they had a stroke in some cases, so you should look for this as well.\nThe final sign on this list? The corneal lens is very sensitive, almost like the part of your brain that helps you read. With this, you can notice if someone has an issue with one of their eyes, but you may not be able to tell for sure if they have an underlying problem or even a problem in another part. And while we\u2019re talking about the sensitive nature of this particular lens, a normal person would still be sensitive to it.\nYou can look at other people by examining the coloration and sensitivity of each eye to see if that person is suffering from any eye problem. Other than that, it is completely impossible to know for certain how sensitive a particular eye is without getting a specialist opinion on it. Even then, there are still many things a patient can hide during the course of physical therapy.\nIf you want to determine the exact nature or severity of an injury in your eyesight, getting yourself checked out is always best. It\u2019s also a good idea to regularly review all of these signs for anything out-of-the-ordinary that might come to light when you are able. This will help keep you from having to face any painful situation without having it confirmed if you notice something odd.\nWhen it comes to eyes and health, always talk to your primary care provider or ophthalmologist to make sure they\u2019re looking at your whole body. They should also discuss all your options with you so that any issues aren\u2019t missed. Your life shouldn\u2019t be taken", "It can also develop when you get something in the eye which is then spread around the other eye, or any other area of your face.\nEye discharge. This can include green, yellow or blood-tinged eye discharge.\nItching is a common symptom, and people can have that and then just think their eyes aren\u2019t clean.\nRedness of eyes. When the whites of the eyes start to develop redness, some form of eye disease could be the problem, although people naturally get worried at first when it comes to their vision. It\u2019s not only a sign of pink-eye, because glaucoma can cause red eyes.\nAs you can see, you won\u2019t have to go to a doctor to know whether you\u2019re experiencing pink eyes or not. That\u2019s just the reality of it. I know I\u2019ve gotten pink-eyes plenty of times before: so have you.", "I\u2019ve experienced pink-eye-like symptoms in the past, but it seemed the eyes would burn to the outside but never inside. I\u2019ll make sure to check the mirror and feel out my eye next time.\nI\u2019ve also experienced itchiness in my eyes from time to time. When this happens, my mind drifts back to a time years ago when I first got a job at a bakery in which I worked at the register and also helped with various tasks, one main one being to take the order for the day and get the product out for delivery, including the bread from the bakery which is the main bread supplier for our bakery. The baking was always done by the baker and the shop, not just mine, stank like all hell.\nNot only did the baking make us cough and sneeze, it also made our eyes water, especially mine. Maybe it was the flour dust, maybe it wasn\u2019t. All I was aware of was a constant stream of tear water running down my cheeks all day long and I didn\u2019t notice it all, I just assumed it had always been the case.\nThis is when allergy shots come into play. For the allergy, yes. But these, the same kind, can be given for just about anything, like pink eyes or something like that can you imagine, too. It takes some time, some shots, and some wait time but you get well and no longer suffer allergies. And this treatment, is it expensive? Some of the allergens are in high demand so yes and others are easier to get for people who don\u2019t have a lot of money and want to keep their eyes safe from these allergies, or pink-eyes-like symtoms. So what kind of shots do you need for your type of pink eyed like symptoms? It just matters if your eye allergies are caused by an allergen (which most are), or by being exposed to dirt and sand and dust that are actually allergins.\nMy last comment: I have to say, reading about allergies and all the different kinds just makes me feel like a total loser. This isn\u2019t just me saying something with my mouth, this is actually what my whole body is doing when dealing with an allergy. My skin is breaking out in hives, even though I don`t see it happen while I\u2019m sleeping, so it\u2019s not the reason I broke out of bed last night and had to see the doctor, after I stayed up all night to help a friend", "Is there a red rash with the swelling?\nRed eyes can be caused by a variety of things. You can get a bit more information from: http://eye.howstuffworks.com/pink-eye.htm", "I have some slight discomfort near my lashline of my eyelid, but not too bad. If I close my eye and kind of lean on my forearm, I can feel it get a little better, which makes me think it's not dry eye causing it. Also it doesn't feel like a stye, more like my contacts are causing a bit of irritation when I look at my eyes from far away I'm wondering if there's something going on that a simple cleansing routine won't help. I use Biotrue gel drops and have been cleaning my lenses every day with AQUA for Contacts. The other day though, my left eye was really irritated, it was burning pretty bad and I felt something weird going inside my lens. Now I've noticed that I think my preservative free DAILIES contacts may have expired as I bought them 4 months back, and they're made of hydrogel. So if that's the case, even though I may not be experiencing eye issues due to pinkeye, this really sucks for my vision. Is there a website I could look on to see if I would need to throw them out, or should I just be safe and toss them in the garbage?\nSorry about your preservatives that expired. You should see and feel a difference with a higher quality brand of preserver. Biodisposables are the best for many of us. Many of the big box stores will let you exchange your expired lenses if they did not have a high quality preservers. Even Walmart will take them back and it is less than 30 days with receipt.

A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables is considered to be a healthy diet. The body can use both water weight (water weight) and carbohydrates (carbohydrates) in order form to lose the weight needed to keep the human form. Some experts think that an increase in carb intake (like consuming lots of sugary drinks or carbs like pasta, pizza, etc.) may actually lead weight gain on your body, while others believe that eating only vegetables will actually give you weight loss. One thing is clear, eating less carbs will lower your glucose levels over time, which will lead to a reduction of your blood sugar levels and insulin levels, reducing the risk for diabetes or prediabetes. For the past decade, people have been aware of how obesity can affect someone's health, in part from the research of Dr William P. Fadell that in 1998 showed that people can reduce their body mass index (BMI) by 25 percent by changing their diets and exercising regularly. But it is becoming more clear that, for most of the population, there are two major factors that influence weight: genetics and environment. There is now a growing body evidence that the environment plays a critical role in weight-loss. Dr. Charles H. Hughes, chief scientific investigator at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, believes, \"A person's surroundings -- things like sunlight, temperature, diet, activity levels -- as well as the genetics of body weight do influence how a person gets overweight.\" That said, research also points to two factors for weight-gain.

For example, herpes simplex (HSV-1), the most frequent cause of eye herpes, is a common infection. In a primary infection, HSV- 1 can infect the eyes, causing blisters and then pukence in this area. The virus may stay dormant latent in eye tissues, and if some cause (e.g., another viral infection) activates the infection again, another herpetic episode will occur.\nIt's possible that, in fact, infection of any other nature (bacterial, fungal, viral, etc.) can predispose the formation of pung, either in another part of the body or in a previously infected site.", "Purulence was noted in all the cases but only one of the seven cases was diagnosed with herpes zoster.

It's quite common for people to make the wrong assumption about where the source of a hearing loss is located. Also, when you say \"loss of balance\", you are almost certainly wrong and there is not necessarily anything wrong with inner- or outer balance. There are 4 types: balance (or equilibrium) in space -- i.e. balance when your eyes are closed, like on an amusement park ride while not moving your body; the vestibulocular reflexes in which the eyes move back and forth involuntarily when the head moves (you notice this when a friend pokes you or you bump your head on a doorway); the visual-vestibular reflex -- these are coordinated eye movements that assist in balance; and hearing -- hearing helps us locate sounds.

I can't find my copy of Fior's pamphlet.. my insurance won't send it for 4 weeks now, which I thought was unusual.\nI am just looking to relieve my pain, in fact, all the ib will do is mask the symptoms, will it hurt me to take it, as far as the Fior, I know you don't mix alcohol with it! I drink coffee, so I am not drinking alcohol right now.\nYes you can take an NSAID. I was about to say you could not take Excedrin, but I just went to our doctor's site, the answer for them was that we should not mix Exceedrin with the drug. For all others I believe the only one to not combine is alcohol. So if it is for the pain it will be alright. It will not make the narcotics not work.\nBut now that I think of Exedrin it has another painkiller in it that you should probably not use combined with them drug it would be bad to use both at the same time.\nDoes the Ex- work any faster than the narcotic?\nI do want some help, just need a little help getting through this.\nNo - the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) are usually used to boost the effect of the Opiods.\nFioricets are only supposed to be taken for pain that is short term. If you are still taking the fiori after 2 months, you definitely should be seeing a doctor to discuss if you need to continue taking it or change medication. Also, it isn't a good idea for you to mix the acetamentophine in the pills you're taking, with other medications.\nWhen taking opioid medications for more than 7 or 8 days you begin to build up tolerance, meaning you will need more every few days to reach the affect you want. Most doctors I've talked to recommend using Tyelanol, Motrin or something like that in conjunction with opioids to help with pain. They shouldnt be used in place, only as an additive.

I had to ask a pharmacist about that a while back and they said it was okay as well.\nYea, its not going to do any harm....but you might get extra sedated by taking the two together. Good thing I guess if that's your goal :)\nThe thing to remember is that these pills have a different way of killing the pain. The effect of Acetaminophen in Fioracet is short term and its pain killing action stops very fast after it is broken down by the liver so ibprofen can take over and do a long-term and not short-term solution as far as pain management is considered. This is why you see the 2 taken together for headaches. When you get the headache, take Fiorcet and Ibprofon together and then you have less pain relief so you don't have to worry about the rebound effect by stopping it.\nA combination of Fiorcectic w/ Ibuprofin or Acetcobenamin is used for chronic migraines.\nHowever, for a common migraine Fioracetic usually does the trick or a Triptan like Imitrex and even Excedrine or Tylenol 4-325. Don't just think that your medication needs to always be different.\nThe way to stop common migrane is a pain killer w/out a decongestant. For example, Percocet vs. Sudafed. Percacet relieves the migraine pain and Sudofed does not help.

The medication works by decreasing the body's immune response to inflammation. This medication is usually taken by mouth. If you are taking prednisonol for asthma or allergies, you may be instructed to use a spacer device with the inhaler. A spacer is attached to the mouthpiece of the predniolol inhalation. You will breathe in the medication as you push it down from the spacer. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Do not take prednilol in larger amounts or for longer than recommended.

It is used to suppress the immune system and to prevent the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. Corticosterone are potent medications, so be sure to read the package insert that comes with the drug.\nWhile the use of cortico steroids has not been implicated in causing cysts, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a potential complication of long-term usage of this drug. Long-term use can suppress adrenocortical function causing a condition called hypocortisolism, where the levels of cortisol (a natural corticotsteroid produced by the adrenal glands) do not rise appropriately after stress. So the patient will have a harder time recovering from a stress like an illness. I haven't ever read of predisolone causing an actual cyst itself.\nNow this leads to a very important topic, the potential effect of stress in all forms (physical, psychological, emotional, toxic or chemical, etc) on the creation of cystic ovarian disease and the symptoms of endometriosis. In medicine, we have to be careful sometimes to not overuse the word stress, because it can mean so many things to so very many people, and what may be a stressful event for one individual may not even phase another. Stress comes in many forms, one of which may, indeed, be the chronic use and dependency on steriods.\nIn the medical literature, there's ample evidence of how stress negatively affects our bodies. One of its detrimental effects is on our immune function. Our bodies have natural defenses against infection, cancer, disease, inflammation, injury, as does the ovaries in terms of creating cyst and ovarian endocrine disease. When under repeated stress to some degree (meaning, for example, daily life stressors like a job, a relationship, finances, parenting, working out, studying, travel, school, pets, family, health issues), a person's immunity is lowered. This becomes a problem when a patient is susceptible to certain conditions including infections, autoimmune disease (like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis), and cyst formation. Immunity becomes even worse when the stress is due to illness and injury.\nOne of the greatest problems from having a reduced body immunity comes from the fact that a body with compromised defenses is more easily able to form the", "The dose of this medication will be individualized.

Should I be worried??\nMost skin diseases do not itch. This is why it's important for doctors to do a patch test (and look at it with the naked eye and/or with a magnifying lens) to see if the reaction is caused by allergy or not.\nAnother thing about dermatologic diagnosis is that a rash often follows a pattern in the skin which can help to make the diagnosis. For instance: the following are all possible patterns that are seen, but NOT necessarily seen together with one disease: linear/striped, ring-shaped, red/yellow flaky scaly patches, small red spots, large red patches (not necessarily raised), flat or low round bumps, raised bumps with red tops and inflamed \"shoulders\" (also known by the fancy name: keratoacanthoma), very raised \"moles\", large raised lumps, swollen lumpy livers, blisters, etc., just to name a few.\nIf you do get a diagnosis, don't assume that just because the doctor gave your rash a name, then the disease is cured. There are often a number of treatment methods, which will work in many cases, and the treatment method chosen depends on factors specific to YOU which include how severe the rash is, where it likes to pop up on your body, how many outbreaks you have in a year, what type of rash you've had before (if any), your age, any underlying medical conditions, if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, allergies to certain medications or treatments, lifestyle, medications, your financial ability to pay for treatment or medications (yes, some medicines cost a lot), etc. Don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion or just get another treatment if one doesn't work.

I wonder why he gave me an inhaler if he suspected an asthma/allergy connection?? I really want to believe he's right. Is it possible it is a bacterial issue? I am leaning towards a viral problem with the sinuses and that's why the sinus infections have been so persistent. But the lack of fever should say something.

And even if I did have", "Or just a corticosteriod?\nFluticasone (Flonaze) is actually a highly potent cortico-steroid which in addition to its known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant actions, it also blocks histamine receptors as well. Steroids, in general, work by attaching to the cytoplasmic receptors on an immune cell's DNA and blocking the transcription of the normal inflammatory messengers such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, chemokines etc. This can have both helpful and harmful effects.\nIn your case, and from what you described, this drug will likely help with your nose stuffiness as it will block the inflammatory mediators which cause the sinus and bronchial dilation leading to your mucus congestion. Unfortunately, as with all steroids used on a chronic basis, the drug can lead to some side effects, most likely the insomnia as your nerves become overstimulated by the effects of long term cortisone. Also, Flutcasone has been associated with loss of bone mass with long use, but this is most significant if taken in an inhaled dose as compared to a nasal dose. I can reassure you in that this will not cause increased blood sugar issues or weight gain, since its effect is on the immune system cells.\nSo it does not effect weight, bloodsugar, or sex drive???\nHow is it dosed, 1 spray in each nostril 2x per day?\nAnd at night before bed or after waking up?? What is your preference in timing?\nOne spray each twice a day. If taking with a decongestant I would opt to take this in the morning and the deccie later, (1 hour after). It usually takes 45 min - 3 hrs for it to get into you bloodstream if you take the time the same time. It takes only a few minutes for most de-congestants to kick in.\nThanks Dr. for getting back to me.

If he still gets them, give an allegric.\nNo one can predict an asthmatic attack but if Z is a tigger (not sure if it is or not), and he starts having bad symptoms, using Z with Singuliar", "I was put on singair as a child and it was an inalhated i am asthmatic and allergic to so may things. If I take singular should I just add an additional inaler to my daily routine?", "Are you taking it for asthma or allergies? If for allergies then it's actually to block your body from producing the chemicals that trigger the symptoms. I have seasonal allergies as well. Try the Singulir, it makes a huge difference.\nAlso, what type of pollen are your allergies to?\nMy dad had allergy problems as a kid and he's a little older than you. He actually still has the same one but it has a lot longer of an active ingredient: Zyrtec-D. It's the only one he tried and said they work pretty well.\nAs for the asthma medication, if inhalers doesn't help then I don't know what could.\nSo I take 10mg of singualir every morning. And 2 sprays of the Albuterol in the morning and 1 in at night. But that really isn't helping. The dr. Wants to put me on steroids which is the last thing I want to do. At night when my asthma really gets bad. My throat becomes congested. To the point where it feels like I'm swallowing gravel and when I try to breath it gets tighter and tighter. That is what the doctor called an asthma attack I guess.\nYou are actually taking WAY too much singuilar. You should be taking 5mg and with a steroid inhalment if you really aren't getting any relief for your asthma. 3 times the normal amount may not be strong enough to help. If it wasn't enough the dr should have prescribed a different one. Or you may just need to go to an allergist to see what you could try. Sometimes it is more expensive than getting it at your doctors office, but if this is serious they need someone who does it all the time to give you a diagnosis and not just guess. Good luck to you and let us know, we are all here for you!", "I'm just wondering if I can use the oral or if the inhalers have a different chemical compound, not that I know anything about that!\nI'm not a fan of the inhaled meds myself.\nThe pulmicort was an intractable steroid that made it very hard to breath and make me hyperventilate.\nSingulir has to be titrated up to full dose, my doc had me take it once a day for week then twice for a week, then three times, etc. until i was on 5 mg tablets twice daily. It doesn't really work that well for me personally, but some people see definite relief.\nI was recently diagnosed with mild asthma.\nSince I have bronchospasms, I guess I get a bit of airway obstruction, no problem with wheezing.\nMy doc prescibed the combination of Advair 250/50 once per day, and Singulart to make sure the asthma stays mild with no serious problems.\nSo far, the medications seem to do the trick, as breathing is somewhat better.\nAt the same time, it is still not as good as it should be.\nAlso, a dry cough seems to persist, which has become worse after I've started taking the meds.\nWhat I read from other people is that the cough is likely to diminish over time.\nThat said, anyone knows how long does it take for the medication to wear off?\nIf I forget to take the AdvAir, can I take extra the next day or will my lungs \"run out of room\"?\nThe other issue (and it's a big one) is, in order of importance:\n1. Do I need to have the prescribed medications on hand all the time?\n2. What about emergencies? (as I don't wanna be \"short handed\" when my breathing becomes difficult, i.e., on days when air pollution level is up, or after a vigorous work-out or strenuous exertion).\nI would like to hear your (meaning \"real people who have actually used these medications\" or any other helpful advice) viewpoints.\nIt is not easy to give sound advice on this stuff if you've never been there. I would just say do what your doc tells you and that your best bet is your doctor.

It was suggested that I get the full blood test done in UK.\nJust to clarify is IgGM testing of any use to get an accurate prognosis??\nUnfortunately the labs in the UK report anything with your name on it including your medical records.\nThe problem is that you tested negative by E.I.A only.

So what can I get from the lab for a report? For my last test the results showed that the antibody was detected, does my body now have it or did they make a mistake?\nRe: Antibody detected - now Non reactive.\nYour antibody result now showed a non-reactive result. The previous lab test result was an inaccurate result.\nNon-reactivity means that for that specific lab, the test used is unreliable and could not measure accurately, or it would result to a false positive reaction. Therefore, that test can't be used anymore for your case.\nYou may get your Hep A IgM antibody reported as detected (which could be inaccurate) or you may have a pending result for further testing. Your antibody can be determined through an alternative laboratory test to confirm or exclude your condition by the time the next sample is sent for testing.\nCan't find in lab. I'm afraid I dont have any advice as I don't know how the new laboratory would react to your previous result (the detected).\nGoodluck and please share the result!\nThanks alot for everyone, after asking and being on hold with other labs the other lab stated they wanted to know the igg results and wasnt sure which the nurse gave me the wrong info. Then I called the doctor and he explained everything. When I spoke with the actual lab at first I was told the same but after explaining what the hospital told me and the way they would read my results, they understood and then stated that I have Hepatitis A. So now I am just wondering what this means and what is it from. All my blood work turned out to be within normal ranges and all else except my liver enzymes being a little elevated. Any info would be appreciated because no one at the office has given any info but to say they have no idea and that they need to research.

This lacto bacilli is always present in the vagina and is a natural part of the healthy vaginal ecology.\u00a0 Lactobaccilus produce lactic acid as a waste product. The lacytic acid in-turn lowers the PH of vagina to 4.0. When this PH is maintained at 3.8-4, it is very difficult for any bacterial to invade the mucosal lining of vaginal wall and establish a infection. Candidial vaginitis develop when this lactobicilli number decreases. As Lbacto's population falls, there is rise in vaginal acidity. pH >4. The PH changes of this type increases the possibility of fungal infection as candida albicans.\nLactobicillius decrease, may for varous reasons eg. In use of oral contraceptive pills, diabetes, post menopause and also during pregnancy, when the estrogen levels drop.\nThe candidal infection, spreads along the vaginal walls when vagina becomes dry, in hot humid climate, during puberty and after first postnatal.

Yeast infection or candidal vaginitis can lead to painful and uncomfortable symptoms. There are several reasons for the vaginal fungal infections. Poor hygiene habits are one of the major factors. Other things that can cause yeast infections such as medication over the counter antifungal cream, hormonal imbalance in the body or due to some health problems. However, the majority of these fungal yeast does not spread through sexual contact. If you are wondering if you can get yourself infected with these yeast from others, let me tell you, it\u2019s absolutely not true. So now, we will discuss the yeast, or yeast candida can be contracted from people.\nIf you\u2019re infected by someone, there may be some kind associated with symptoms that I mentioned below. Most yeast yeast fungal infection does go away within a week. Also, you know that it is important for our health to maintain good hygiene. As mentioned above, poor hygiene is one reason can make you develop a yeast vaginal infection. Therefore, good personal hygiene play a major role here to avoid yeast disease.\nSymptoms of yeast\nThe symptoms of a fungal vaginal yeast include irritation of vagina, itchiness, vaginal discharge and pain in intimacy. Although most women are more at risk of contracting candidiasis infection between the ages of 20 and 40. It is caused by excessive production of bacteria in women. Usually, overuse of antibiotics to kill a certain bacteria, cause them to overproduce in quantity.\nTo understand, if the fungal disease is the problem of hygiene, I will give you a complete information. Candidal vaginal fungus, not sexually transmitted, and cannot be contagious. You cannot, therefore, catch these things from other people having these symptoms, for example, a boyfriend, girlfriend or friend? However some women may think that they are infected and contract from partners, in fact nothing is true.\nWhat you do not know is that Candida albicans is part of your body. For example: A yeast overgrowth, which may occur in people with a weak immune system. A common cause of fungal vaginosis. Some people say that oral herpes is transmitted. Oral herpes that causes sores or blisters on his or her mouth, tongue and lips, may appear in a sexually active person, however it does affect the entire mouth of an infected person and it can pass from a kiss with the infected. On the other hand, herpes virus does pass through a sexual partner.\nHow", "You can be sure of this statement?\nThe answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. \u201cNo\u201d because the yeast is a normal part of your natural flora in the vagina, but also \u201cYes\u201d for a reason because as long as a healthy body, it always remains a member of the flora. However, as soon as you have some kind of a health problem, the balance can change. When it is already so and the body needs a boost to restore balance, you already can treat something with Candida.\nIn addition, Candidal yeast and bacteria can live together, so that they together a kind bacteria is good to keep your body. As a result, even if you treat your disease, and you still do not feel well, then the situation will not change anything. In this case, what you may have to do is treat yourself with natural remedies for yeast.\nThis means that the only way to treat a yeast with a treatment of Candidiasis that is natural can effectively rid yourself of all infection, if it comes from the food you eat? Can food help in preventing the infection? A yeast treatment with the help of food is effective, or not? Read the statements made by the expert on this article, which you can get all the answers to their questions.\nWhy is my body vulnerable to yeast?\nA yeast can not be a problem for your health, until the environment that you keep in your vagina is very favourable. Once this is the case with you, your risk of getting an infection will be very high.\nWhen you are in a vaginal tract environment, that has a lower acidity, they can cause problems for both bacteria and yeast. But if your pH level is 2 to 5, this would be enough to kill the fungus. Because he can die in such an environment.\nThere are factors that can affect your vaginal pH. Each of these factors can have their positive or negative effects on the Candidin levels in our bodies.\nThe foods you consume can either help you to protect yourself against yeast, a factor that contributes to the maintenance of balance or they may affect the pH levels of our body if our pH decreases and our acidity increases we will cause the death of yeast cells and therefore, we also decrease the levels and we protect ourselves.", "\u2013 the case of the yeast infections caused by candida that usually occurs in men is almost 5%, and in women, almost a third. And about half of them have to deal with recurring infections and are referred to as recurrent yeast is a symptom, and not a disease.\nYeast, fungi and even bacteria will, in their natural habitat live in large amounts in the human body. It means that it can occur in and around the mouth, the genital area, even in your digestive tract.\nWhat determines the amount of yeast to be present in humans?\nA healthy immune system is able to regulate the number of Yeasts and fungi, with the help of microorganisms that compete with yeast and fungus. The immune response to keep the numbers of yeasts in check.\nThe normal population of Candida albicans is about 0.001% of all micro-organisms living inside the body.\nThis is the balance of flora that is present on your own skin, inside your mouth and nose, on the skin of your breasts, of both children and adults. These fungi can also live and thrive throughout your system without ever to cause you.\nIt is known that these can cause infection in some environments, as in newborn babies, people who use broad-spectrum antibiotics, or those with a compromised immune function.\nA yeast (the fungus) called Candidiasis is associated. In medical terms, it is called an \u201covergrowth\u201d a condition known as candidiasisia. Sometimes we say that the fungus or the bacteria is \u201cout of balance.\u201d The problem of this kind is that if a Candidasiasia can not be treated in a timely manner, will eventually lead to candidal infections.\nCandidiasiae is when the Candidal organism is growing in an area that does not have the flora needed to control their growth, this is why we see it as the common Candidasa infections. But candidasie and infections by Candid are two distinct things.

It is available in tablet form and is taken by mouth. Dflucancan is also available as a vaginal suppository. The medication works by killing the yeast that causes the infection. Yeast infections are caused by a fungus called Candida albicans. This fungus is normally found in the vagina in small numbers. However, when the balance of bacteria in your vagina is disrupted, Candid a albican s can grow out of control and cause an infection.\nDifflufcanc is a prescription medication and should only be taken as directed by your doctor. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should not take diffluncan without first talking to your docto r. Some side effects of diflucon are headache, nausea, and diarrhea. These side effect s are usually mild and go away on their own. More serious side effec ts include liver damage and allergic reactions. Liver damage is rare but can be life-threatening. Allergic reactions are also rare, but they can cause serious problems such as anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).\nIf you experience any of these side ef fects, stop taking difflucon and call your doc tor immediately. You may need to be hospitalized. Do not use difllucon if you have ever had an allergic reac tion to it or to any other ant ifungal medications. Before taking this medication, tell your d octor if: You are allergic to diflluc an or any othe r ant i fungal medications You have liver disease You ar e pregnant o r breastfeeding\nDflfluccan should be stored at room temperature away from light and moisture. Keep this and all other medications out o f the reach of children.", "You ask?\nMany women today are concerned about natural remedies, but there is still a lot who are looking for relief for their yeast infections, and therefore prefer something fast-acting and easily accessible. Some people, though, don't get to the doctor soon enough, especially when the yeast has really taken over. In that situation, an antifungal is the right solution.\nOver 80% of women will experience at least one yeast vaginal infection during their lifetime. Diflufican is one of the two medications that have been FDA - approved since 1990 (Fluconazole being the other one) to treat yeast-related infections. It is actually taken by mouth in a single large dose, which is different from other types of antihistamine used for vaginal yeast or urinary tract infections.\nAlthough it could be taken anywhere, DIFLUCHAN\u2122 100 mg film coated tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Make sure you have some in plain view for your next yeast attacks! Dose and frequency of dosage are based on the severity of your infection.\nDifflucad 200 mg tablets could work faster than the traditional dose of oral fluconanole with just 3 days of treatment, compared to 7 to ten days from the first use of vaginal cream.\nThe success rate is about over 70% for the single dose. The higher dosage used by some women who prefer 400 mg of single does will be over a 90% success rating. And it works for about 50% less time than vaginal creams used to do for mild cases.\nWhile diffluncan has been around for some 30 years, there are things to weigh when you try this medication, because not every antfungals react the same way, nor will they have the exact same side affects. While it can be successful, it is known to sometimes carry some severe side effects, like headache, abnormal heartbeat, nausea, skin rashes, changes in liver function, diarrhea, cramps, indigestion, loss of appetite, stomach pain, vomiting and even yellowing of skin, jaundice, or dark-colored urine, just to name some. If you suspect that you are allergic, you might have a skin rash, itching, swelling of mouth, lips and face, shortness of breath, tight chest, fast pulse.\nAll these are serious signs that can result in an allergic reaction. This reaction can often be deadly, so immediate medical attention is needed in", "Diflufuran? The active ingredient is fluconazole. It is a systemic antifungal prescription product for severe yeast infections, including some vaginal yeast inf. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any meds. DIFLUFURAN is usually sold over the counter. Some over-the-counter meds are used to treat yeast and other fungi.\nI have been suffering from painful vaginal itching, burning, and discharge. I took two diflufluran and the symptoms are worse. So I bought Dihlofuran to stop this but it did not cure the problem. My doctor prescribed it for me. What happened next? My symptoms came back after three days. He told me to discontinue taking Difulfloran after the first week and keep on taking the pills weekly. This means I\u2019m going to keep taking it forever, but I have no idea how long that will be.\nMost people do not experience this side effect and that\u2019s because they take the drug in the form of a pill so you swallow the pill. You are using a capsule (the same one you used for the Duhdufaran tablets).\nIs 1 diffluflurana tablet equal to one pill of the prescription medicine?\nA tablet is equal one to three pills of prescription medication.\nA difflufurane capsule is one half of one capsule of diflfuran.\nHow do I take diflucent?\nFor example, a difluent medication could be taken by an injection or by taking 4 capsules of Difuflurfan, 30 capsules per day for 7 pills a day or 20 capsules for ten pills per week. Or 10 capsules a week for twelve days a or so.\nCan diflant (a combination of diphtheria and hepatitis A vaccine) be used in pregnant women?\nNo, you should not take this drug during pregnancy or while you are pregnant because it may cause serious birth defects (including neural tube defects). If you experience the following symptoms during a period of pregnancy, contact your physician immediately: rash, fever, headache, fatigue, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, coughing, or any skin reaction occurring within two weeks of your first dose\nWhat are the side effects of taking diflon\nDiflun, the active substance in diflun tablets, has some minor effects (such as skin or eye irritation, itching) in some people.\nIs it possible to be allergic to difloren?\nYes, in", "How does it work to remove the yeast?\nMy gyno told me to use difflucane for at least 14 days. So one week in and I can actually see that the infection gets less and not more.\nIs that normal? Should I be worried? As I said in another post it seems that with the diffluence the symptoms just gets worst.\nA friend gave me this cream (over the counter) and after a week the swelling was less obvious. Today I just went to the gynecologist and she wants me now to take 4 pills a day instead. She said it could get worse but she doesn\u00b4t know what the problem is.\nI am worried and feel really uncomfortable...\nHow does diffluence work exactly? Do you know? Or should I stop to ask her how and wait for the 2 weeks to see the end?\nI took one pill a weeks ago and didn't really think about taking the others.\nThe first week I took it I saw my yeast levels drop with every dose, the next week (when I only took 3 doses in total), I noticed no change at all. \u00a0Now I have stopped taking it all together, (last day was about 5 days ago) but my infection hasnt cleared up at ALL. \u00a0\nI too am on Diflucene 200 MG for two weeks and find that it isnt helping at first I thought it wasnt doing anything but then today the burning started getting less severe. I hope after two complete weeks it is gone. My doctor said to make sure you take a second pill at the same time each day to have it as a constant dose and also to try taking 1000 MG of vitamin c twice a month. Also she said i should try using the pills in capsules.\nHi there! You're not alone. The way I was treated for this was very unprofessional as well, my PCP wanted me on oral antibiotics for only 1 week, after about a months worth of this not working, I decided to go to my OB/GYN. He, first suggested oral difluccan, which has worked for me in the past. However, he did not give me enough pills and suggested that I should only take one a night. After only about three nights of not getting better, but even worse, 10 days later I'm still on the second week of my 7 day long prescription, and the fungus has only migrated down to a different area", "What about taking an antibiotic for the infection?\nMany women wonder, when it comes to the treatments they can use for their yeast infections, \"what about if I use difflunisal for it?\" While that might have been a legitimate option a few years ago, there are new treatments that are both safer and more effective in the fight against a vaginal yeast attack. That can be a huge deal for women, particularly since there is no reason to put up with the pain, discomfort, and health damage from a chronic infection. Read on for more information about using diflucon for your yeast problems.\nIn order to understand what diflocan can do for yeast, you have to first know what it really is. It is an antifungal medication that has, unfortunately, been pushed and promoted in ways that have made it very well known and popular. The problem is that the drug comes with a number of side effects, most of which are particularly significant in those with chronic yeast attacks, but that doesn't mean that it's not good for infections that need attention. This drug is often used to treat infections in children, such as the very serious fluconazole infection.\nThe use of difocan is very similar to all the other treatments for Yeast infections on the market today - you simply use it once or twice a day. You don't want to use this treatment more often than the recommended dosage, otherwise you could have very negative effects. One way to prevent overuse or misuse of this medication is to take it at night while you sleep. However, if you're using this drug during the day, it is most effective when taken with food or on an empty stomach. When you are taking this medicine on a regular basis, make sure that you keep it well hydrated.\nWhat can this all mean for you? You can experience a wide variety of different symptoms from using Difflucor. To begin with, your vaginal region could feel sore, inflamed, or infected. In addition, as this infection becomes very severe, symptoms can become even more uncomfortable, including burning or itching. As a result, many women choose to simply deal with their symptoms in a non-aggressive manner, taking steps like taking a bath or showering every day to reduce the chance of recurring infections. A woman may need to seek treatment for this type of infection immediately, though, especially if she cannot control it any other way.\nThere are a variety factors that can make a woman more susceptible", "Many people have used it successfully with great results! As we stated, there are plenty of other remedies for yeast infections. However, this has also been widely popular as well.

So, before buying, be sure you have enough information and that the product has been approved by your state health department to give you the benefits you need.\nSome women also prefer to take homeopathic medicines because they are less expensive and less addictive. What about these diffluoride drugs? They work by flushing out the vaginal secretions, helping the yeast fungus die. This prevents recurrence. Also, they contain natural vitamins and minerals that may help prevent the growth of candida albicans. It contains essential minerals like zinc, selenium and manganese, as some women report increased energy and decreased appetite.\nIf you want to try homemade medicine for treating yeast and vaginal infections, you can use a mixture of apple cider vinegar and vinegar as a douche or lotion.

The following suggestions may be useful to you if you want relief from your pain \u2013 without having to spend a small fortune to do so.\n1.) \u00a0A warm compress on your neck or ears may reduce the pressure and give you some relief. Be careful of the type of cloth you use because many, especially cotton, are extremely absorbent, and can leave you with painful skin that becomes chafed.\u00a0 Always use caution when using a moist compress. You may even find some of these small electric warmers and you can attach it to other items you may have; such as a wash cloth, or an ice skating helmet.\n2.) Some people use vapor rubs to apply to the neck and ears; however, always test a tiny portion first. Never apply it near your eyes. If you find a brand of vaporub especially helpful, you know which one to use for future reference. Check out the ingredients to make sure it won\u2019t aggravate your current condition. It may help to reduce inflammation.\n3.)\u00a0 Using a humidifier in the room(s) in your home where you spend the majority of your time, may also help with nasal symptoms as well. This is especially useful if someone in our house uses a heating system. When a dry environment exists in a home, the mucus in nasal passages and throat dries out. As we know, dry mucs is easily to get stuck.\n4.) Over the Counter Medications\nIbuprofen is a\u00a0pain reliever that helps to lower fevers\u00a0and reduces swelling.

I suffer from severe panic/anxiety attacks. My mind tells me I am going to die. It causes my body's fight or flight instinct to respond. Sometimes if I don't recognize the attack, it starts to affect my breathing and heart rate. If I see what is occurring, I can relax myself. When I started experiencing attacks, when my heart was racing and I was breathing quickly, my husband helped me to recognize what was happening to me and how to control it. He would remind me that what I thought was a fast heart beat, wasn't. What I \"heard\" was not as fast as what my brain actually was \"reporting\". If and when I recognized it happening, that was sometimes enough to slow me down enough so my breath would begin to return to normal.

I have been working in this field for almost 20 years and I can tell you that there is always a reason why.\nWhen you were a child you probably heard a story about something that causes you to fear it now. Many people that I treat had a person or parent that was overly cautious to an exaggerated extent and used fear to control the child.

Now the brain thinks that it needs to tell the person that they are in danger. This is a way of protecting the individual from danger and keeping them safe! But at some point in time the mind will need protection.\nThe point is when you take a deep breath in and say to yourself I am safe. You will feel safe again and will get to the root of why the fears started in you.

If the pulse rate falls below 60 bpm, it is known as bradycardia (low pulse). Bradycardia can be a normal physiological response in healthy individuals during sleep, endurance athletes, and older patients. However, it can also be a symptom of an underlying disease such as obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, infectious diseases, central nervous system conditions, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, anorexia, and hypoxia. Certain drugs like calcium channel blockers, lithium, opioids, and beta blockers can also cause bradycardia. Once the underlying cause is treated or the causing drug is stopped, the bradycardia usually resolves.

It is also known as bradycardia. A normal heart beat is between 70 and 100 beats per minutes. The heart is the most important organ in the body. Its main function is to pump blood to the rest of the organs. When the pulse rate drops below 50 beats a minute, it is considered to be a slow heart rhythm. This is not a serious condition, but it can be dangerous if it persists for a long time. If you have a heart condition or are taking medication for your heart, you should consult your doctor before taking any action.\nWhat is pulse?\nThe pulse, also called the heartbeat, is an involuntary contraction of your muscles that occurs when you breathe. Your heart pumps blood through your body, and the blood flows through the arteries and veins. As the pressure in your arteries increases, the walls of these vessels expand and contract. These contractions are called pulses. They are caused by the contraction and relaxation of muscles in different parts of our bodies. For example, when we breathe, our lungs expand, causing the chest to expand. Our heart contracts, pushing blood into the lungs. Then, as the air leaves the lung, we exhale. During this process, there is no pulse. However, if we hold our breath, then the muscles of both the diaphragm and chest contract, creating a pulse.\nWhy is my pulse low?\u00a0\nA slow pulse can occur due to many reasons. Some of them are listed below:\n1. Low blood pressure\nLow blood pressures are usually caused due the lack of oxygen in our body tissues. Oxygen is needed for the proper functioning of all the cells in out body.\n2. High blood sugar levels\nHigh blood sugars are also a common cause of low blood flow. In this case, your blood vessels become narrower and less flexible. So, they cannot carry enough oxygen to your organs.\n3. Poor circulation\nPoor circulation is another common reason for low pulses.\n4. Lack of exercise\nLack of physical activity is one of those things that can cause low heartbeat. Exercise helps to increase the amount of blood flowing through our veins and arteries. And, this increases the number of red blood cells that are circulating in us.\n5. Stress and anxiety\nStress and Anxiety are two other factors that contribute to low beats. Both of which can lead", "| What should you know?\nThe heart is not the only body part that requires constant protection. The arteries are also vulnerable to damage and disease. One can also have a slow heart rate because of various reasons. This is termed as bradycardia. What is a normal pulse anyway?\nMany times the doctor tells us that our vital organs such as the heart that keeps our bodies moving is actually ticking away at about 60 beats a minute. When it is below this, then we can say that it has a slower pulse.\nHowever, a pulse rate of 50 BPM (beats a per minute) and below can easily be regarded as low. So we need to look out for that.\nThe low range of the pulse can either be as a result of congenital abnormalities of some type or some kinds or acquired conditions.\nThis is known to cause a slowing down in the normal rhythm of our pulse. Tachycardiabasics.com wrote that some medications that can cause it include: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, Digitalis preparations and anti-psychotics.\nThere can be the case of a condition like hypothyroidism which is an underactive thyroid. A slow and low blood flow may also be because one is suffering from low body temperature. That is, if your body is in a state of hypothermia.\nA condition known as myocardial infarction or a heart attack can do it also which may likely be fatal.\nWhen your pulse is slowing and your heart condition is failing, you might think it's too late but there are ways to find out how best to improve this.\nCardiolive.com suggested that in order for you to know that there is still hope, one can consult with a doctor after this diagnosis. There may be a need for a cardiac pacemaker in those suffering heart failure. You can check it out here.\nYou will have to take your hands in front of your chest just below your armpits and you may place a finger on the opposite thumb. After a while, notice whether it beats. If it doesn't then that means you have bradyarrhythmia which can lead to low heart palpitations.\nIf that is the outcome, your doctor may want to check to see whether there may have been any complications from cardiac surgery.\nFor a person to get the best pulse reading results, he or she should be lying still on their back after not having done any exercise or strenuous work.\nAnother way to getting your results is by holding", "What is the normal level that would be considered as low?\nA low resting pulse may just mean that you have a very fit heart. I don't think it's a cause for concern. Do keep in mind that exercise raises pulses dramatically. That's part of the reason it works.\nYour resting heart rate may be as slow as 40 beats per minute (BPM), and as fast as maybe 130 BPM. (I haven't looked it up but think I've seen this range. It could be different, but this gives the idea). Some people's resting BPM is faster or slower than others'. My resting rate is between 80-85 BPM, depending on time of day, etc. My boyfriend's is 55. Very healthy, fast, marathon runners may have resting rates as high as in the 30s or 60s.\nA heart that is low in BPM but works well may compensate by pumping a little harder to do the same work as a higher BPM heart, or by having stronger contractions. On the other hand, a larger heart may work at a faster rate than a smaller one doing the job.\nIt's good to know your heart's basic BPM to start with, if you intend on doing something like tracking your rate through exercise to see what it does to your resting state. But there's no danger with a heart working well to produce a slow, fit resting heartbeat.\nSource(s): Some study I heard about on NPR.\nI believe a pulse of 50-60 is just the low end of normal. However, it may vary according to age and also the person. For instance my heart beats at 64 and I'm 67 years old but a 25 year old would have an average of about 70-74. In other words, we get slower as we age.\nIs your pulse rate higher than usual?\nWhy would a person want to have heart disease?\nWhat to feel when having heart attack?\nWhy does having a high blood pressure affect your whole body?\nWhen taking a resting, should i measure the pulse in both arms?", "To obtain an objective answer, we will tell you the most common causes of tachycardia or bradycyst in men.\nAccording to some standards a male pulse of a person can range from 50 to 90 beats per minute. At 180 bpm or less it is low for the majority of men and, therefore, it can be an alarming sign.\nThis may happen as a result of cardiovascular diseases, when a patient's blood circulation slows down.\nIt should be a reason to consult the doctor, because this condition may be not too critical yet sometimes in case of bradykinesia heart failure, loss of consciousness may occur.\nThe most important thing for a man to know is the low level of blood pressure and a good way to keep this data is to visit a cardiologist regularly to monitor blood flow.\nIf a woman has tinnitus, she should talk to a doctor who can check the heart and blood vessels.\nFirst Aid for Arrhythmia at Home!\nIn case you feel unwell and are sure that it has an acute problem with the cardiovascular system, use 10 steps to rescue.\n2.

Therefore, they are prescribed only after a preliminary examination during which an electrophysiological study of heart activity and ultrasound of neck and abdominal vessels are conducted, as well as the blood test is analyzed. Medications from timitism can include: a beta-blocker of cardioselective action", "- Dr. Srinivas V\nWhat is the ideal pulse rate? Is a very low rate normal? What could be the possible reasons for low or high heart rates? These are some of the very common questions that people raise regarding their pulse rates. We talk to Dr.Srinivasa V. who is a Cardiologist working with the Care Hospital. Pulse rate is nothing but the beats, which we feel while putting our hand on the wrist and counting them for 60 seconds. An ideal heart rate for a grownup human with a resting state is about 70-80 beats per minute and a pulse of less than 80 is ideal. In a younger person with good physical fitness the heart does not work extra hard thus the pulse is faster. Generally pulse faster than the usual is due to various reasons. Some of them are due the increase in metabolism rate in one\u2019s body, when the body gets active. That means when we start doing sports or start exercising the metabolism or the rate at which food is processed gets increased. Then the circulation becomes faster to process the extra amount of energy due in form of food that is being supplied to the cells for digestion and metabolism. As soon as the work stops, the metabolic rate slows down, circulation of blood also comes slow; heart starts beating with normal rate i.e.70 beats a minute. If the higher heart beat is not due external physiological factor\u2019s like exercise etc it can be due some illness like stress, anxiety or due metabolic defects that can lead to increase of heart beats called tachycardia. When these situations persist for long duration and are persistent the increased heart beating may lead cardiac diseases.\nAlso Read: Know the different factors affecting heart health -Dr. Prakash Singh\nSometimes the causes for irregular pulse will not be physiological and it is difficult to predict. But the most common cause of irregularity in pulse, is called Atrial fibrillation. It is basically where the upper two chambers of heartbeat have an irregular beat. This happens due excessive strain in the chest like angina pain. High blood pressure can also lead it and there might be a high probability of that happening.\nWhat precautions do you need take when it reaches to 120 beats on daily basis? For what duration you have been experiencing a fast pulse? It\u2019s very important to know that a higher pulse can cause damage to your internal organs; especially to kidneys.\nA slow pulse and abnormal pulse must never be neglected. Slow pulse means less beats which can mean your", "Here are some possible explanations and what you can be aware of about how low heart rate may impact your health.\nYour heart is like a pump, which has two job: moving oxygen-rich blood through the body and pumping toxic or stagnant blood back to the lungs to be re-oxygenated. As you breathe in, your lungs expand, providing additional work to your heart. That is why when you are under emotional stress, like being anxious or feeling overwhelmed, you notice you heart racing, as your body is calling to push oxygen to all areas that may need it.\nIf you have a heart condition, or if you\u2019re exercising, heart rates can go above 120 beats per minute on a regular basis.\nWhat is the Normal Heart Rate?\nWhat Would Make Your Pulse Faster?\nIf your pulse regularly goes above an estimated 70 beats a minute, it is not normal. It is important to know what your average resting heart beat is.\nTo find your Resting Heart beat, check your wrist or finger pulse for a week, at the same time each day (e.g., 8 am, same day each week). Count 1 or 2 pulse cycles for each reading, taking an average of your total readings during the week. Be sure to check again at a different, less stressful time during your day to ensure you haven\u2019t been stressed at an unusual level during one of the normal reading times you chose.\nWhy Do I Keep Seeing Low Pulse?\nWhy would your resting pulse be 50 to 60 beats/min or lower?\nA low resting rate can indicate heart disease like atrial fibrillation, but a slow resting heartbeat isn\u2019t necessarily an indication of a health problem. Many young and fit endurance athletes have slow heartbeats by nature. So do some people who are very thin or underweight. Hypothyroidism and low blood sugar are possible reasons too. If you think your heartbeat is unusually slow, talk to a doctor.\nIn general, a pulse rate less than 100 indicates a healthy situation that is called bradycardia. Heart rates of between 40 and 80 are fairly common. Normal blood pressure is defined as 90 to less-than 140 over 55 to -90 or less.\nOne important reason is that your adrenal glands aren\u2019t working correctly. Adrenal fatigue can make your baseline heart-rate low; when fatigued, the heart needs more fuel to function correctly, so it speeds up, even when resting.

The term \"proton therapy\" refers to a type of radiation therapy that uses pro tons to kill cancer cells. Unlike other forms of radiotherapy, proton beam therapy is able to target tumors with high doses of energy while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. As a result, this type therapy has been shown to be more effective than traditional radiation treatments in treating certain types of cancer. What is a Pro ton? A Pro tone is an energy particle that is found within the atom. Its main function is to hold the electrons in place and keep them from flying off into space. Without pro tones, atoms would not be able be stable and would eventually collapse. How does Pro to n Therapy Work? Pro tons are tiny particles that are found inside atoms and molecules.

As soon as the hydrolysis of ATP supplies the necessary energy to create a proton gradient across a membrane, a prokaryote can use a different\u2026\nHow does a sodium proton exchanger work? A sodium/proton exchangers, or NHE, is a family of exogene proteins that exchange sodium ions for hydrogen ions. The exchange mechanism utilizes a transporter protein that, when coupled with metabolic energy, allows for the transport of a net charge to or from the cell. Sodium-proton antiporter is an\u2026\nCan you run an anode a second time? When it\u2019s time for a battery inspection, your technician may tell you your battery needs to be reconditioned.

A proton is a stable subatomic particle with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary particles that are not composed of other particles are generally known. Proton pump was discovered and isolated from the parietal cells in 1985 and given the name hog proton. [ 13 ] [ better source needed ] from that discovery to 1990, more than 50 different hog proton proteins were found. they were all different and did not have the same function. all the other proteins had been discarded.\nSo what are proton pumps in simple terms? an enzyme in your stomach uses hydrogen, chloride and water to create acid. you can think of a proton as a positively charged hydrogen ion (p+). when the enzyme is activated, hydrogen ions are given off and the gastric acidity increases. there are two different types of proton channels in stomach tissues.. The proton gradient is essential to the functioning of chloroplasts and is the major source of chemical energy for most plants. in plants, mitochondria use nnaadp to generate an inside-negative membrane potential and proton-gradient across their inner membrane..\nIn general, proton transporters function by either pumping pro -tons from an acidic intracellular compartment to a neutral external space, or moving pro-tons out of an intracel- lular compartment where they had to be transported out in order to remove excess cytosolic acid produced as an artifact of aerobic metabolism and to maintain a normal. The h +-atpases are plasma- membrane proteins usually located in areas of the plasma membrane that play a pivotal role in transport physiology, thus facilitating both water and ion movements. this is certainly true for several membrane-located epithelia, which are specialized for water resorption and secretion..\nThe h+-atfases or proton \u2013 atpase is an electrogenic at- plasmalemma hydrogen pump in fungal endosomes, vacuoles, plant tonoplast, insect hind-gut, and mammalian kidney, endo- somes, langerhans cells, sperm and certain other cells that regulate the intravacuolar or intravesicular h+ concentration. because it uses at p, the", "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs that suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric proton pumps in the parietal cells in a dose-dependent manner.\u00a0 PPI are used for the short- and long-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection and reduce its associated gastric ulcer, and for suppression of acid hypersecretion disorders, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.", "A proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) is a type of medication whose main function is to suppress the secretion of gastric acid by irreversible inhibition of the H+ + +H2O = H3O+ reaction catalyzed by H+/K+-exchanging ATPase.\nProton pump inhibitors (such as lansoprazole) are used to treat conditions caused by too much stomach acid such as ulcers, heartburn, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.\nPantopradole, lomerprizol, and omepradole are examples of proton inhibitors that belong to the proton inhibitor subcategory.

This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in your arms and hands. The most common cause of cervical nerve root compression is degenerative disc disease. Other causes include herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or trauma to the spine. If you are experiencing symptoms of this condition, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible. Treatment options include physical therapy, medications, injections, surgery, etc. In this article, we will discuss the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, prognosis, complications, risk factors, types, exercises, diet, lifestyle, home remedies, FAQs, tips, myths, facts, research, statistics, history, anatomy, physiology, pathology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, genetics, immunology and more.\nCervicogenic headache is caused by a problem in or around the cervical spine (neck). It is often associated with neck pain and stiffness. Cerebral radiculo pain can be caused due to a variety of reasons. Some of these include:\nDegenerative Disc Disease: This occurs due when there is wear and tear of the intervertebral discs. As we age, the discs lose their ability to absorb shock and become thinner. When this happens, they can bulge or herniate, putting pressure on the nerves.\nHerniated Disc: A herniation occurs if the disc material protrudes through the outer layer of cartilage. It can compress the spinal cord or nerve routes.\nSpinal Stenosi: Spinal stenosisis a narrowing of spaces within the vertebrae. Spine stenoisis can occur due in several ways. One way is when bone spurs develop on either side of a vertebre. These spines can press against the nearby nerves. Another way that spine steni can happen is if a disc herniates and presses against a nerve. Finally, spine can also occur if there are tumors or cysts in a person\u2019s spine.\nTrauma: Trauma to your neck can result in cervical spinal injury. For example, a car accident could cause whiplash, which is an injury to soft tissues in and around your spine and neck. Whiplashes can lead to cervical stensosis.\nInfection: Infections such as meningitis or encephalitis can affect the brain and spinal column. They can damage the protective covering around these structures, leading to inflammation and swelling", "Is it any different from \"cervical dysfunction\"?\nIt\u2019s more of an in depth clinical diagnosis of what\u2019s actually going on with your neck.\nIn a sense, cervical dysfunction is a catch all term that\u2019s not fully backed up by scientific evidence.\nI mean what does your \u2018upstream cervical region dysfunction\u2019 mean\u2026you are saying that there is something wrong at the level of your first cervical vertebrae, the atlas vertabra, you mean.\nWell, yes, but how do you get there?\nThe key word is dysfunction.\nIf you don\u2019t know what it means, it\u2019s a pretty broad term.\nTo be honest, when I was working as a chiropractor, whenever I would make this diagnosis, I never knew exactly what I had just diagnosed.\nIt really is just the term for \u201csomething\u2019s wrong, here\u2019s the neck, and now I need to do this treatment to make it better\u201d.\nAnd I really was thinking of it that way.\nAnd that was why I felt like it was so vague.\nWhat is actually happening in the spine?\nThat\u2019s when they do the spinal MRI or the myelogram, which looks at your nerve roots, so they look at if your discs are degenerated.\nDoes your spine look healthy or not?\nDo you have a herniation that could be pressing on a nerve root?\nBecause really, there are only four, or five at most, specific diagnoses when it comes to neck problems.\nCervicogenic headache is one of those diagnoses. That is if there actually is \u2018tension\u2019 coming off your upper neck muscles that is pulling on your nerves that goes into your head.\nYour head can be a very sore area, from your lower neck all the way to the back of the head, just behind your eyes.\nThis is where you might have \u2018myofascial pain syndrome\u2019 or something not so serious as \u2018cortical dural compression\u2019, which can involve pressure on the venous and/or lymphatic drainage in this region, producing nerve irritation symptoms.\nA vascular condition of \u2018extradural vascular compression syndrome\u2019, can lead to a neurological syndrome from a tight vascular loop, in which the artery or vein are actually pressing up on these nerve fibres, such that the nerve becomes trapped inside of this compression loop.\nSo you\u2019re not just getting, as the chiropractors put it, \u2018upper cervical trauma and biomechanics dysfunction\u2019, or \u2018lower cervical myofacial dysfunction causing a subluxation of some sort", "Cervical radicular pain, or neck radicolopathy, is pain that is created when the nerves leaving the spinal cord to the arms and hands are affected. Cauda equina syndrome is a form of radculopathy that occurs when pressure is placed on the roots exiting the spine and results in a collection of symptoms throughout the limbs.\nA person suffering from cervical raicolpathy typically suffers from neck pain and stiffness as well as radition pain extending into the neck and upper extremities. Other symptoms can include weakness, tingling, pins and needles, inability to grip, and numbness as you progress down the arm.\nWhat are the causes of CERVICAL radICULOPATHY? Causes of cervical myeloradiculitis (sudden onset pain) include trauma that injures the intervertebral disk and herniates, traumatic fractures of the vertebrae or spondylolisthesis, inflammatory joint involvement and infections that cause destruction of adjacent tissues, cervical spinal tumors, and arachnoiditis.\nOther causes are non- traumatic, such as cervical sponylis, which is an abnormality that exists at birth, but this abnormal formation can cause instability, pinched nerves and chronic irritation over time. Also, osteochondtosis of posterior longitudinal ligament, a condition that forms with age that causes narrowing of central canal at the C3-4, C4-5, & C5-6 levels, as it affects the cervical disc space, can result in cervical nerve root swelling and irritation.\nSymptoms of spinal stenosis are similar to those of herniated cervical interveebral disc.\nAre certain individuals most likely to develop cervical radiaculpath? Males are at greater risk for developing cervical vertebral osteoarthritic changes. In addition, smokers have a two fold risk to non-smokers for degenerative changes in the lower vertebar.

With cervical issues at play, some of the symptoms of nerve pain may include tingling, numbness, or weakness in the shoulders, arms, and hands.\nCervical strain is another potential cause of cervical damage, as it is very common for the neck to become strained during manual labor or during lifting. If you recently injured your muscles or tendons of C4 through T1 during any of these activities, you may be experiencing cervical strain.\nIf you suffer from any underlying spinal conditions, it may also put you at a high risk of suffering nerve damage to your vertabrae.\nHow is Cervica Radicuopathy Diagnosed?\nAlthough cervical disc radcicopathy can often be mistaken for other issues that cause pain in your shoulders and upper back, a proper diagnosis is paramount to obtaining the proper medication or treatment for your individual case. While a doctor\u2019s physical exam is useful in diagnosis, there are a few other methods that may help you pinpoint the exact cause and location of any pain or injury.\nNerve root blocks are particularly useful for pain management purposes, although most doctors prefer to use these as a last resort.\nWhat is a CERVICAL DISC HERNIATION?", "We can define it as \u2018pinched nerve\u2019 in our cervical spine, which is the seven-bone column in the neck that supports our head and shoulders. It\u2019s important to note that pain is never experienced directly by a nerve, but the pressure on it from the damaged disc or bone structure causes irritation of the nerve or nerves and the resulting pain occurs just outside the region where the pinched nerves are. Symptoms can be either sharp, dull or burning in nature and can also be accompanied by numbness and weakness. The most common symptoms are pain in hands, forearms and fingers.\nCauses and Diagnosis\nInjury, overuse and aging causes degeneration or inflammation in one or more discs (cervical discs). In these cases, the patient will usually find that he or she lacks the ability to fully rotate the head over the shoulders on one side. There may also have been injury resulting from an auto motor accident or a severe fall directly on the back or neck.\nThe nerves in your neck (brachial plexus nerves) are often affected by cervical disc syndrome. These nerve fibres run from your shoulder blades right down to your fingers and this syndrome can trigger pain signals from these damaged nerves.

This results in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm. A cervical herniated disk, cervical spinal stenosis or a bulging spinal disc can cause nerve pressure.\nCommon causes of cervical spine conditions may include injury to the cervical vertebrae from sports injuries, car crashes, falls and similar activities. These injuries can lead to bone degeneration, such as cervical osteoarthritis, compression fractures (cervicothoracic fractures), foraminal stenosisis and cervical spondylosis (incomplete spinal cord damage), and even fractures in this region. Caring For Nerve Damage In The Neck | Pain Doctor\nCompression of nerve tissue leads to a condition called, \"cortical compression syndrome.\" This condition is generally caused due to degenerative arthritis (osteoarhritis) in patients over the age of sixty. The spinal discs and adjacent bones in these patients can also become painful due their degenerating bone structure. Herniated disc in most of these seniors would be the result of progressive degeningration, rather than injury.\nCompression in your spine may arise from diseases in addition to aging. In particular, a slipped disc is a common cause of compression inside backbone of people in their own 20s and 30s. Patients with degenerated bones have to be more careful due with their spinal structure, especially if that bone is fractured.\nYour own spine is designed to absorb shocks during movement and sudden movements. If the bones of your own backbone are not intact, then they're likely to become compressed. Fractures would cause pain because of pressure, swelling or bruising of tissues. Pain could last anywhere from 3 weeks to six weeks.\nFracture in spine can occur in people of all ages. However, the condition usually affects individuals who have a lot of problems. People who suffer from degenedated (osteoporosis) bones can experience fractures and other health problems as a result. Some fractures tend to happen in young children and they are most likely caused from an automobile accident or fall."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6441, "rouge1_r": 0.2071, "rouge1_f1": 0.3134, "rouge2_p": 0.1538, "rouge2_r": 0.0492, "rouge2_f1": 0.0745, "rougel_p": 0.3475, "rougel_r": 0.1117, "rougel_f1": 0.1691, "bleurt": 0.3452, "bert_score_p": 0.8237, "bert_score_r": 0.8603, "bert_score_f1": 0.8416, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5593, "rouge1_r": 0.1618, "rouge1_f1": 0.251, "rouge2_p": 0.1111, "rouge2_r": 0.0319, "rouge2_f1": 0.0496, "rougel_p": 0.2542, "rougel_r": 0.0735, "rougel_f1": 0.1141, "bleurt": 0.2653, "bert_score_p": 0.8051, "bert_score_r": 0.835, "bert_score_f1": 0.8198, "hallucination": 23.076923076923077, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.6186, "rouge1_r": 0.2051, "rouge1_f1": 0.308, "rouge2_p": 0.1453, "rouge2_r": 0.0479, "rouge2_f1": 0.072, "rougel_p": 0.322, "rougel_r": 0.1067, "rougel_f1": 0.1603, "bleurt": 0.3006, "bert_score_p": 0.8168, "bert_score_r": 0.866, "bert_score_f1": 0.8407, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5593, "rouge1_r": 0.2357, "rouge1_f1": 0.3317, "rouge2_p": 0.1453, "rouge2_r": 0.0609, "rouge2_f1": 0.0859, "rougel_p": 0.2627, "rougel_r": 0.1107, "rougel_f1": 0.1558, "bleurt": 0.3018, "bert_score_p": 0.828, "bert_score_r": 0.8511, "bert_score_f1": 0.8394, "hallucination": 7.6923076923076925, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5678, "rouge1_r": 0.1872, "rouge1_f1": 0.2815, "rouge2_p": 0.094, "rouge2_r": 0.0308, "rouge2_f1": 0.0464, "rougel_p": 0.2797, "rougel_r": 0.0922, "rougel_f1": 0.1387, "bleurt": 0.3067, "bert_score_p": 0.8278, "bert_score_r": 0.8595, "bert_score_f1": 0.8434, "hallucination": 23.076923076923077, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.6271, "rouge1_r": 0.2202, "rouge1_f1": 0.326, "rouge2_p": 0.1709, "rouge2_r": 0.0597, "rouge2_f1": 0.0885, "rougel_p": 0.339, "rougel_r": 0.119, "rougel_f1": 0.1762, "bleurt": 0.3006, "bert_score_p": 0.8303, "bert_score_r": 0.8639, "bert_score_f1": 0.8467, "hallucination": 15.384615384615385, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

It is an antibiotic which can only suppress the infection and help contain it till your immunity picks up some strength. Therefore, if you do not have the required dose of augment at the needed time, the bacteria will again come back to haunt you. You are better of using the right antibiotics when you are ill and have an infection to complete your course of antibiotic therapy to ward of this infection. If you have already finished the course, then chances of recurrent infection are low.\nWhen the dosage is high, it affects the gut flora badly, making it highly vulnerable to infections, particularly those caused by the Clostridium difficile.\nSide-effects are common, such as diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, colics and drug-resistant bacterial infections. Side-effects can also result from long-term use.\nIf the usage is heavy, then it could cause liver & kidney damage.\nLong term usage could damage the tendons in people aged above 60.\nChildren who are exposed to ampicillin for more than 2 weeks face a higher risk of developing allergies.\nTherefore, using augment without proper prescription is a strict no, no!. This is because if your doctor cannot diagnose you properly, he cannot prescribe you the correct course. A mild ear or eye discharge can have severe underlying causes. For example, an orbital fracture can cause severe eye infection if not treated properly. Do not self-prescribe anything without consulting your physician.\nAlways follow the protocol mentioned in prescription and complete the entire dose.", "Generic name: Ampicillin (am PIE cil in) Brand names: Unasyn\nWhat Is Augmentin Used For? Augmentation therapy is a drug or therapy that alters the patient\u2019s central nervous system, thereby making him or her receptive to psychotherapeutic intervention. In other words, augmentation therapy can help make patients who are not good candidates for talk therapy open to it by changing their brain chemistry. There is some evidence that it can be especially helpful in treating depression that has been resistant to both medication and talk treatments. It can sometimes help people with anxiety disorders be more receptive when in talk-therapy.\nDoes augmenting therapy work for some disorders? It might. Augmention has the potential to help treat patients suffering from mental illness, particularly those who have been diagnosed as psychotic, including those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and those suffering a range of personality disorders. Patients who engage in alcohol abuse, are addicted to drugs, or have other substance abuse problems may also benefit from augmentation therapies. However, there is also debate as to whether they work. Some studies suggest, for example, that those treated with augmentation were more likely to see the benefits of psychiatric care at least as long \u2013 if not longer \u2013 than those in the control group. At the other end of the spectrum, others have found no evidence of effectiveness at all.\nCan someone go into remission while on augment therapy? The jury is still out on that one, but most agree that a person on augmentation usually experiences some significant relief in his or psychological distress. What\u2019s more, most experts maintain that any remits experienced while in treatment cannot be attributed to medical intervention alone; that is to say, the fact that someone appears to be experiencing relief (and in fact is in remit) does not mean that the treatment was not beneficial in its own right. Many experts believe that psychological and emotional difficulties stemming from early childhood trauma or other forms of abuse can lead to many symptoms of mental disorders, such as psychosis, mood swings, anxiety, and so on. These symptoms can also contribute to some of what we commonly think of as \u2018normal\u2019 psychological characteristics, like low self-esteem and poor relationships with others.

It can affect one or both eyes. Blepheritis is not contagious. The condition is often chronic, meaning it can last for a long time. However, blepheris can be managed with proper treatment.\nWhat are the symptoms of blepahritis?\nThe symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have mild symptoms, while others may experience more severe symptoms. Common symptoms include:\nWhat causes blephaeritis?\nThere are several different types of bacteria that can cause blepheitis. These include staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae. In addition, certain viruses can also cause the condition. For example, the herpes simplex virus can lead to blephereitis.\nHow is the diagnosis of Blephaeitis made?\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They will also perform a physical examination. During the exam, your doctor may look for signs of inflammation in your eyelid. Your doctor might also order tests to confirm the blepeharitis diagnosis. This may include a culture of your eye discharge or a biopsy of a small sample of tissue from your lid.\nBlephaphritis treatment\nThere is no cure for blepaeris. But there are treatments that help manage the disease. Treatment options include antibiotics, antivirals, or anti-inflammatory medications.

It is a chronic inflammatory disease of eye-lid. Blephrititis is mostly non serious and will last for months.\nTypes of Blepheritis : The two types of blepherites are as follows:\n1. Bacteriel Blefaritis: In this type of disease the bacteria acts as a causative factor. The common bacteria involved in causing the disease are\u00a0 Staphylococcus pyogens, Stphylococcous aureus. The infection may be acute or chronic or both.\n2. Seborrhic Bleparitis / Sebouritic Bleparaits: It may also be due to dandruff present on scalp.

Inflammatory changes present in the lining of mebilomom glands results into secretion of inflammatory mediators. These enzymes cause break down of membranes of these glands secretory tissues or epithelial barrier of gland. As a result the pathogen enters intercellular or cellular space.\nAs a part of non immune reactions in inflammatory processes, there are release of lysosomal enzymes which are responsible for tissue destruction.\nAcute blefparosis is characterized by intense itching of lids and irritation while in chronic cases it lasts for life time, only condition is that symptoms varies from mild to moderate. Some cases are severe and may produce corneal damage leading to ulceration and perforations.\nSymptoms and signs: One can come across with blepahritis with following symptoms:\n  1.Less or increased tears.

Bleps can sometimes be triggered by hormonal or immune system changes, such allergies, blephy is more commonly seen in women than men, and there are often cycles of remissions and flare ups of symptoms. Often associated with bleps are conditions like bleary and blocked tear ducts (obstruction of tear canal), conjunctivitis (red bloodshot eyes), dry eyes, styes (infection in eyelid\u2019s oil glands) and contact and allergic conjuctivtis.\nAs with many conditions the exact cause is not clear, however bleh is often caused an imbalance in your tear film, which lubricates the outer surface of your eyes.

It causes itching of eyelid margins that leads to poor closure of eyes resulting in irritation and excessive tearing. This in return causes recurrent conjunctivitis or chalazia. Chalasia are often seen and experienced during childhood. Blephirits may be recurrent or chronic and is not considered a serious problem. At times it is seen along with dry eye syndrome or rosacea, an inflammatory disorder of face.\nIt can be caused due to many factors like inflammation of glands near hair follicle, allergies, bacteria, dandruff, mites, chemicals, makeup, meibomian gland dysfunction or inflammation. Bacteria is considered to be the predominant reason associated. Staphylococcus epidermis is the most common bacterium responsible for causing Blehritis.\nAs mentioned the bacteria is responsible but how it leads the inflammation is unclear. According to researches, the bacterian affects the mebioman gland to produce thick grease that in turn clogs the gland leading to its dysfunction.\nWho is prone to Blepherobias?\nAs discussed above children are prone. Anybody who does not have good hygienic habits are more prone.\nAnybody with skin conditions like eczema or psoriases may also develop this condition along.\nSymptoms for Blepherdobitis\nSymptom associated to the disease vary based on the source of infection and the extent of inflammation.\nCommon symptoms may include the following:\nIf diagnosed with blehperodiasis, visit your specialist for the right treatment.

What conditions cause chlorohexidine to break down?\nIn 1957 a scientist named N. G. Boardman and his colleagues found that chlorinated diguanides acted as biocides. This was the beginning of chlorhhexidene-based sanitization and disinfection. Chlorchlexidine was introduced as a major disinfectant in the mid-1950's. It has remained one of the most commonly used disinfections. The chemical was developed to have low toxicity, good stability in aqueous solution, and antimicrobial activity in a wide range of pH values.\nHow Chlorhexdine Kills Microbes\nChlorhexadine kills gram positive and gram negative bacteria, spores, viruses, fungi, protozoa, yeasts, yeast-like fungi and slime molds through the disruption of cell membranes. There are two main components to chlorchexidne, it has four biguanidine rings and each ring has two chlorophenyl groups. Both the chlorine atom and nitrogen atom are able to react with the membrane lipoprotein in bacteria. Because of its unique structure, chlorhenidine is able not only to kill bacteria on the exposed surface, but also prevent future spread within the host.\nDisinectants should be used in areas where microorganisms accumulate such as medical instruments, laboratories, toilets, hospitals, clinics, kitchens and laundry. In hospitals the use of disinective products reduce nosocomial infection rates, especially when used on hands (hand washing), surfaces and high touch objects.

{"Question": "What is sciatica", "Free_form_answer": "Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the sciatic nerve path due to sciatic nerve injury or irritation. The most common cause of sciatica is compression of the sciatic nerve root by a herniated disc in the spine. Classically, the pain affects one side of the body and radiates from the buttock down the back of the leg to below the knee. The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks.

These include: -A hernia in a nearby muscle or joint -An injury to one of these muscles or joints -Inflammation of one or more of them -Compression of nerves in these areas -Spinal stenosisis -Piriformus syndrome -Sciatical nerve compression -Tumors in nearby tissues -Trauma to these tissues\nHow is Sciatiatic Pain Treated?", "Sciatica is an extremely painful condition that can be difficult for sufferers to explain to others. Often the pain is so intense that it limits the patient\u2019s ability to move, relax or even sit still as the intense pain runs down one or both legs, and many sufferers choose to give up driving because the discomfort gets worse during the journey.\nPain along the nerve pathway is what causes a sufferer to experience the extremely nerve pain, which can make it hard for them to rest, work, sleep or exercise. A suffer of sciatic pain will most likely feel a shooting sensation like an electric current, with muscle weakness, cramps, numbness and tingling of the extremities.\nWhile there are many people that suffer from sciactic pain and feel tremendous discomfort from it, fortunately the cause is easy to diagnose in many instances. Sciatic nerve dysfunction is most often a result of a herniated disc in the lower back, a narrowing of spinal canal in a condition called spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, or bone spurs caused by arthritis in your spine.\nTreatment Options For Sciati ca Relief\nMost patients get very effective sciati relief from over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen of acetaminophen or stronger medications with a prescription. Most patients are surprised to learn that there is a very quick and effective treatment by applying ice to the affected area for 15 to 20 minutes at a time for one week while not taking anything. The swelling will go down and most patients will have almost immediate relief.\nA combination of over the counter pain relievers and ice is usually enough to manage the condition for a lot of patients but there comes a point in time where the person wants relief that is quick. In these cases, many opt for sciatia shots where a health professional inserts a needle into the buttocks area that gives the feeling of pressure but nothing more. From there they inject a solution that has a combination \u00a0of medications to relieve the painful symptoms including steroids and a numbing agent.\nFor sciatics that won\u2019t go away, an MRI will show if there may be a disc herniation in order to get a full diagnosis.\nThere are other options that your doctor can give you including physical therapy and medication.

Maybe it\u2019s sciatics \u2026 maybe not.\nWhat Is The Root of this Confusion?\nThe main problem is that in chiropractic there are two terms that are confused regularly, the first one is:\nThis is simply a nerve issue. Sciatosis is a combination of both the above conditions. The name is derived from the term \u2018sciatic\u2019 (referring to the large sciactic nerve) and the Greek term osis (disease). Sciatis has a Latin origin coming from \u2018Sciatica\u2019. Both names refer to inflammation of the nerves at the lower buttocks or sciattic nerves.\nSciatic Pain can occur along the entire nerve length. It could be felt anywhere along your sciact, in your leg or even in the butt. This condition may be acute or chronic depending on its cause and treatment used for its resolution.\nIf you are asking whether it could also be the muscles, there is an excellent chance it may not be. Your muscular structure is quite capable of managing this problem on their own if properly taken care of.\nI once had a chiropractor, who was the father of a good mutual friend of mine, say to me \u2026 \u201cThere is rarely sciatitis, because it comes from a muscular problem\u201d. This is very true. If you have muscles that do not work properly, they will cause a lot of trouble down the road.\nMost often the pain is just the tip of an underlying issue, such as poor posture, muscle imbalance and improper movement patterns which lead to muscular problems. So, it makes sense then that the problem of sciatican would be solved from these things.\nHowever, once these are identified and worked on, you may find it hard if not impossible to change some of these behaviors. Thus, I personally believe that getting these other problems solved will have an extremely positive impact on your health and lifestyle. I can say that my sciactive has been resolved 98 percent of what it used to be.\nTherefore, after all these years of doing chiropractice and getting the muscel balance worked out again, even with many years passed by, my pain, tension, nerve problems are resolved.\nNow I just have to stay on top of my workouts and do what I need to do to keep my muscles and other structures limber."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4777, "rouge1_r": 0.304, "rouge1_f1": 0.3715, "rouge2_p": 0.1256, "rouge2_r": 0.0798, "rouge2_f1": 0.0976, "rougel_p": 0.2098, "rougel_r": 0.1335, "rougel_f1": 0.1632, "bleurt": 0.3432, "bert_score_p": 0.8314, "bert_score_r": 0.8507, "bert_score_f1": 0.8409, "hallucination": 10.526315789473683, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4777, "rouge1_r": 0.2426, "rouge1_f1": 0.3218, "rouge2_p": 0.0762, "rouge2_r": 0.0386, "rouge2_f1": 0.0513, "rougel_p": 0.2054, "rougel_r": 0.1043, "rougel_f1": 0.1383, "bleurt": 0.3372, "bert_score_p": 0.8277, "bert_score_r": 0.8539, "bert_score_f1": 0.8406, "hallucination": 21.052631578947366, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5134, "rouge1_r": 0.2758, "rouge1_f1": 0.3588, "rouge2_p": 0.1525, "rouge2_r": 0.0817, "rouge2_f1": 0.1064, "rougel_p": 0.2188, "rougel_r": 0.1175, "rougel_f1": 0.1529, "bleurt": 0.3258, "bert_score_p": 0.8315, "bert_score_r": 0.8533, "bert_score_f1": 0.8422, "hallucination": 10.526315789473683, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4821, "rouge1_r": 0.288, "rouge1_f1": 0.3606, "rouge2_p": 0.0987, "rouge2_r": 0.0588, "rouge2_f1": 0.0737, "rougel_p": 0.1875, "rougel_r": 0.112, "rougel_f1": 0.1402, "bleurt": 0.3194, "bert_score_p": 0.8171, "bert_score_r": 0.8408, "bert_score_f1": 0.8287, "hallucination": 15.789473684210526, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.433, "rouge1_r": 0.3322, "rouge1_f1": 0.376, "rouge2_p": 0.0987, "rouge2_r": 0.0756, "rouge2_f1": 0.0856, "rougel_p": 0.1786, "rougel_r": 0.137, "rougel_f1": 0.155, "bleurt": 0.3061, "bert_score_p": 0.8314, "bert_score_r": 0.8519, "bert_score_f1": 0.8415, "hallucination": 21.052631578947366, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4286, "rouge1_r": 0.2341, "rouge1_f1": 0.3028, "rouge2_p": 0.0628, "rouge2_r": 0.0342, "rouge2_f1": 0.0443, "rougel_p": 0.2143, "rougel_r": 0.1171, "rougel_f1": 0.1514, "bleurt": 0.2963, "bert_score_p": 0.8091, "bert_score_r": 0.8255, "bert_score_f1": 0.8172, "hallucination": 21.052631578947366, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}]}
{"Question": "What is the best hypertension treatment for patients who are also diabetic?", "Free_form_answer": "There are various ways to treat hypertension, and some of them have shown to be beneficial for people with diabetes. These treatments include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is crucial to know that lifestyle changes, like weight loss, increased physical activity, reduced sodium intake, and limiting alcohol consumption, are often recommended as a first step when diagnosed with hypertension. If these lifestyle changes do not help lower blood pressure, medication may be necessary. Your doctor may recommend treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in combination with other drugs like calcium channel blockers and thiazides.", "Must_have": ["Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, increased physical activity, reducing sodium intake, limiting alcohol consumption are sometimes recommended as first line treatment for hypertension in people with diabetes", " Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are a possible treatment for hypertension in people with diabetes", " Either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be suggested for treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes", " Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a possible treatment for hypertension in people with diabetes"], "Nice_to_have": ["Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be combined with other drugs such as CCBs and thiazides for treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes", " If lifestyle modifications alone are not effective in reducing blood pressure in people with diabetes, medications may be necessary"], "Sources": "https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-016-0485-3#:~:text=Angiotensin%20converting%20enzyme%20inhibitors%20(ACEI,hypertensive%20treatment%20in%20diabetic%20patients.", "ICD_10_diag": null, "sample_predictions": ["The answer is not as simple as it may seem. The best treatment is one that is tailored to the individual patient. There are many factors to consider when choosing the right hypertension medication for a diabetic patient, including the type of diabetes, the severity of the hypertension, and the patient\u2019s overall health.\nThe first step in choosing a hypertension drug for diabetic patients is to determine the cause of their hypertension. If the blood pressure is high because of a problem with the kidneys, then a diuretic may be the most effective treatment. Diuretics work by increasing the amount of urine produced, which helps to lower blood volume and blood flow. This can help to reduce the workload on the heart and improve blood circulation.\nIf the high blood is caused by a hormonal imbalance, such as too much aldosterone, a beta-blocker may help. Beta-blockers work to block the effects of adrenaline, reducing the body\u2019s response to stress. They can also help lower heart rate and reduce blood vessel constriction.\nFor patients with diabetes and hypertension who have not responded to other treatments, an ACE inhibitor may work. ACE inhibitors work on a different part of blood vessels than beta blockers, so they can be used in combination with other medications. These drugs can lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.\nFinally, for those with severe hypertension and diabetes who do not respond to any of these treatments alone, combination therapy may provide the greatest benefit. Combination therapy involves taking two or more medications at once to achieve the desired effect. For example, one medication may lower systole while another lowers diatole. By combining different types of medications, doctors can often find a combination that works best for each individual case.\nNo matter what type or severity level of hypertension a patient has, there is a treatment option available that can provide relief from symptoms and help prevent further complications from occurring. It is important to work closely with a doctor to find the correct combination of drugs that will work best in each case. With proper treatment, patients can live long and healthy lives despite having both diabetes mellitus and high BP.\nWhat are the side effects associated with hypertension medications?\nHypertension medications can cause a variety of side-effects, depending on which type is prescribed. Common side-effect include dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, insomnia, anxiety, depression, muscle cramps, joint pain, skin rash, hair loss, weight gain or loss", "According to recent research, the most effective hypertension drugs do not raise blood glucose or HbA1c levels.\u00a0Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy is a popular choice among diabetes patients, but it is not a very effective treatment. The drug was first recommended in 1998, and it has since been the subject of several studies. According \u2026\nWhat Is a Low-Carb Diet, Exactly?\u00a0Carbohydrates and their metabolism are the primary focus of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. When our bodies lack carbohydrates as their primary energy source, they must consume more lipids and protein for energy. This leads to increased amounts of ketones, which are chemical molecules that can be converted into fats and stored in the body for later use. How Low Carb Diets Work\u00a0Most \u2026\nAn Overview of Low Oxalate Diabetic Diet: Oxalic acids are found in a variety of foods, including vegetables, beans, nuts, chocolate, tea, coffee, berries, and dairy products. These acids can cause the formation of kidney stones. Oxaloate levels are highest in some green leafy vegetables. Most people consume enough oxalates in their diet to lower urine levels to a safe level, according to studies.\nWhat Causes Oxalytic?\nA diabetic who has high blood sugar can reduce the risk of developing oxylate by maintaining good nutrition for diabetes. A high oxaloacetic acid level is measured in your urine. If the test results are positive, you may have a problem with your kidneys. You can take a drug that lowers oxalyic acid levels or ask your doctor about a kidney transplant if the problem is severe enough to require surgery.\nThere are other conditions that might cause oxalogic levels in urine to be high. Toxemia and liver disease can also cause high urine oxalic acid. High urine can happen if you take too many medications, such as phenytoin. Women who use birth control medications have higher urine acidic oxide levels than men do. For most people, no special treatment is needed to deal with this problem. However, a doctor should be notified if a person has a history of seizures or kidney problems.\nIf you feel that your diet is affecting your kidney function, ask a health care provider to monitor your oxallyte levels on a regular basis. It is better to prevent kidney failure than to have it treated once it occurs. Many people with mild kidney disease need a daily dose", "This is one of several questions the Hypertension Canada Evidence-Based Guidelines Committee addressed in the development of a new hypertension practice guideline. The results of the 2014 guidelines were published in 15 papers that were disseminated online, in print and a special issue of Canadian Family Physician. \u201cHypertensive disorders are complex and management varies widely among patients,\u201d says Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, chair of Hypothesis Canada and the guidelines committee.

In this issue, we present articles on screening strategies, lifestyle changes and treatment guidelines, as well as an overview of 10 key changes to the hypertension guidelines that are of particular importance in primary care.", "What is diabetes? Diabetes (high blood sugar) can happen either when the body does not make insulin or when your body is unable to use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that your pancreas makes to help your cells use or \"take up\" the sugar (glucose) in your blood. Diabetes is divided into 2 groups: There are 3 types of diabetes: Here are some causes of type 1 diabetes:\nDiet, heredity, and lifestyle may play a role.\nIn type I, the pancreases stop to produce insulin, because the immune system of the patient attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in his pancrease. The cause of this auto-immune attack is unknown. In type II, insulin resistance and insulin deficiency play major roles. Although type Is mainly affects young people, sometimes it can affect adults. It does affect children.\nIf diabetes is inherited or develops in childhood, it is called Type I Diabetes. While diabetes, especially Type II Diabetes, can occur anytime. Type 21 diabetes mellitus can develop over time. People with Type21 most often have extra weight, particularly in their belly area. As you may already know, type of hypertension affects more men than women. For this reason, male patients have a risk of developing the disease that women do not have. However, all factors affecting the progression of high blood pressure (hypertension) may contribute to the development of obesity.\nWhile obesity is not a direct or certain cause, but an important risk factor for both type! diabetes. These factors affect the functioning of insulin. This causes diabetes and obesity. There is an increased risk for high glucose levels in diabetic patients. Obesity has been shown to be linked to high-risk factors such as heart disease and stroke. High blood glucose is one of these factors. A recent study showed that high sugar levels can increase your risk to three times the heart attack of those with normal sugar level.\nWhy is it important to decrease hypertension?\nHypertensive patients are often obese. That is because obesity can lead to hypertension. Being healthy means taking care of your weight! There have been studies that prove this. When you are obese, even minor elevation in blood presure can be harmful. Uncontrolled blood suga levels, which are very common in hypertensive diabetics. Can cause many problems. If you also have hypertension, you need to pay special attention to your diet. Diabet", "The answer may depend as much on the patient as it does on their hypertension medication. An analysis of 17 large-scale studies suggests people who take certain blood pressure drugs may be more or less likely to develop kidney damage, or worse, diabetes. So, what do these studies mean for your patients with both conditions?\u00a0\u00a0\nKidney damage in patients receiving medication\nThe studies included more than 200,000 patients. Some received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an AT-receptor blocker, which are common prescriptions for blood-pressuring lowering. Others received a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker instead. Researchers found that patients taking ACE inhibitors or AT blockers were 26 percent less and 14 percent more likely, respectively, to be hospitalized for diabetic or end-stage kidney failure.\u00a0\nDiabetes in Patients receiving medications\nResearchers also found patients on beta- blockers or ACE inhibitor/AT-R blocker combinations were more (31 and\u00a027 percent,\u00a0respectively) likely\u00a0to develop Type 2 diabetes, compared to those on calcium blockers/ACE inhibitors, ACE\u00a0inhibitor/alpha blockers, and calcium blocker/ alpha blockers. \u00a0\nWhat are ACE Inhibitors?\nACE Inibitors help relax and widen blood vessels, thereby lowering blood volume and pressure.\nThey are prescribed to patients not responding to other treatments, people with angina, kidney disease, heart failure, high blood-pressure, stroke, cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat to do with this information?\nTalk with your patient about their medications in detail. Make sure they understand these risk factors and symptoms of adverse reactions. If they show signs of\u00a0hyperkalemia, low blood sodium, chest pains, swelling, shortness of breath, sudden weight gain, weakness, a cough, difficulty breathing, palpitations, dizziness, rash, itching, sweating, trouble breathing or swelling of the face, lips, throat, tongue, hands and/or feet, you will want to adjust their prescription. You should also talk about\u00a0other\u00a0medications that may put them at special risk. These might include antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, itraconazole, ketoconazol), antifungals (fluconizol and clotrimazle) and other drugs (proguanil, spironolactone, sucralfate, trimethoprim).", "The answer: one that treats blood pressure and diabetes. Two drug classes for hypertension can also treat high blood glucose: the renin receptor blockers or RAS (angiotensin system) blockers and the sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.\nAccording to findings from a study, those who had their blood sugar under control also had better heart health even if their pressure hadn\u2019t been lowered to the recommended level for their age and risk factors. As a result, these drug families are two of the three drugs recommended by several cardiology societies for people with diabetes and hypertension.\nAren\u2019t there more?\nIndeed! But those are reserved for heart failure or for the very small percent of blood-pressure-elevated people who also have a very enlarged heart. They also require close blood-chemistry-checking for liver and kidney function \u2013 though if patients have been prescribed them on an outpatient basis, they should have already been checked. If not \u2014 well, there are at least a couple of reasons to make sure they\u2019ve had those checks. The drug companies want to protect themselves against lawsuits. And if something does go wrong, it is definitely in your best interest to have your physician know what medications you are taking and not take any unnecessary risks with your health.\nWhat about blood thinners?\nWarfarin is not safe to give with metformin, sulfonylureas, and glitazones, so it\u2019s usually avoided in diabetics.\nHeparin and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are safe.\nDirect-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs like apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxban) also safe. So are direct thrombin inhibitors (tenectaparag and fondapapragril).\nWhat if the patient is pregnant?\nIf a patient has hypertension and another heart condition that requires antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy \u2014 or if there is another indication for treatment such as diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia and eclamps \u2014 drug therapy may include any of those listed above.\nIf we treat them with antiseizure drugs (like lamotrigine), can we use the same dosing in the presence of these agents?\nIn general, drugs that are metabolized by hepatic enzymes like liver cells should be adjusted, depending upon which pathway they inhibit.

It is used to detect and manage a wide variety of disorders, such as urinary tract infections, kidney disease, and diabetes. A urine sample is collected in a clean container. The sample can be tested in several ways. One way is to use a dip stick. This is simply a piece of plastic with a series of chemical pads on it. Each pad reacts to a different substance in the sample. For example, one pad will turn blue if there is blood in your urine, another will change color if you have sugar in it, etc. Another way to test the specimen is by using a microscope. In this case, the technician will look for bacteria, white blood cells, red blood cell, crystals, or other substances that may be present. Urine cultures are used when a person has a urinary infection. They are done to determine which bacteria is causing the infection and which antibiotic will be most effective in treating it.\nWhat are the symptoms of a UTI?\nWhat causes a bladder infection?\nHow do you treat a kidney infection?", "what to expect about a urine test?\nA urine specimen can be examined in two ways\u2014 by physical observation or testing with chemicals on a special paper ( urinanalysis ) and bacterial culture. The latter technique can determine whether there is a bacterial infection, identify the specific bacteria and what antibiotics will treat it.", "is there any urine test more specific\nWhat test is most helpful to differentiate between UTI, kidney disease, or infection with other organisms like yeast. Any other tests you are aware of?\nAnswer: In general, a urine analysis is a test where the urine is taken to the clinic where a trained technician can see the results via the uranalyzer microscope with a drop of dye. This is where cells are seen under the microscope and a picture can be had of how cellular the individual is; also, the technician may be able to see crystals which may tell where there are problems on an individual basis. A urine cultures (cultuering) are where samples of urine are \"planted\" on specific media dishes and different types of bacteria will \"grow\" depending on the type of dish. Also, specific fungi can show up on this test... The tests are not always 100% accurate so sometimes one may want to repeat the tests if needed.\nAre there more tests available by a medical professional for diagnosing Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)?\nYes, although this is not as popular as a routine urinanalysis done at your clinic... If a physician, however, wants to do a more thorough urine testing or to monitor medication, one might do something called Bacteriurua as well as urine Cultures and urinelogical tests. There many tests which can include a urinalsy, complete urianalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy (looking at the bladder), and urethroscopy, and so forth. One question to have is as to why do all the diagnostic tests because it can become overly costly sometimes; this needs to be looked at from a perspective if the cost could be better used doing a therapy that is more effective and quicker... What are your thoughts about your urine being a window of your body health?\nWhy do you have a lot of protein in your stool and you don't have any parasites or bacteria, is it bad?\nThere can always be reasons for excessive protein that you may not be aware. If this bothers you, I would seek medical or professional help and do some tests to verify where this protein may coming out. My guess would be digestion issues; however... if you want a second to third opinion, please post this question on our website for professionals to hear your questions and answer them for you.\nI had a uti and it turned out i was negitve for e.coli, but i still had", "?\nAsked by \u00a0sumitasharma | 6th Jul, 2009,\u00a005:33: PM\nThe first thing which must be done is a microscopic examination of the urine. The urine is centrifuged to concentrate the cells and pus, and the cellular debris from the specimen, examined under a microscope to look at the WBC (polymorphs), RBCs, renal tubular epithelial cells, epitheloid cells of bladder, squamous cells (cercariae), bacteria, fungi and yeast.The urine sample is passed on to the laboratory for cultures.The urines sample should be brought into the clinical laboratory as fast as possible by an individual who can give a full urine history before the analysis and culture is started.It is essential that the physician tells the nurse or medical technician the following things. If the patient is receiving any medication. the type and amount of antiseptic or soap used to clean the perineal area before voiding. In what position the voided sample was collected, because a urine specimen with a predominance of Wbc (the most mobile leukocytes), is likely to be from a female who had difficulty with urination. Finally, the clinician should state the condition for which he or she asked for a urinanalysis. 5-10 millilitres (mL) of urine must go through a series of tests that can identify if blood, proteins,glucose, nitrite,urobilinogen and urochrome is present.", "what are the two most common symptoms of UTI and bacterial vaginosis? and why is that symptom usually a sign of vaginal yeast instead of urinary tract infection?\nUrinalyses and culture are completely different procedures used in lab diagnosis to detect UTIs. The former is for screening tests while both are used to establish accurate diagnoses.\nUrinea analysis is a screening test used initially to find out if a patient is suffering from a UT infection; on the other hand, a urine test is done to test the microbes present in a particular urine sample and is used for accurate diagnosis of a specific infection. Urinalysts only look at the colour, transparency and cloudiness of the urine, while a culture entails testing the actual fluid itself.\nThe common symptom of both UTs and BV is urination in which your urine burns during urinating, in fact many people assume that they have UT when they actually have vaginitie. BV can occur in individuals who are pregnant, which include all the symptoms and other complications.\nIt is important to note that a large percentage of women suffer from yeast infections during their pregnancies. In fact, 75% of all women will be infected by this disease during this period.\nThank you so much for sharing... That clears any doubt i had\nUrilineal analysis can lead to wrong and vague diagnosis (it happens not only in pregnancy but also in many other conditions that may trigger false positives)\nAnd culture also gives u wrong results. My friend had a negative blood test,culture,urinal analysis but when she used a home test. It revealed positive pregnancy", "What is its process?\nWhat are the most common errors in a urine test? How do we avoid them?\n- What are urine sediments also known as urinanalysis?\nAre urine tests also commonly used to diagnose or detect diseases? Which?\n1. The most significant difference between microscopic uric analysis and a 72 hour urine collection is that, with microscopic analysis, the volume of urine being evaluated is almost always small (e.g., 20-100 mL).\nWith regard to collecting the urine samples, some techniques may pose more risks than others. For example, a clean catch urination procedure poses lower risks compared to catheterization or suprapubic bladder aspiration.\nWhat errors can one encounter in urine testing, and how does one avoid these errors?\nThere are certainly many potential errors that can occur in performing a urioscopy and urianalysis. If not done correctly, false positive and false negatives are possible. One can avoid most of these problems by following some basic precepts. First, always compare the sample to be examined by microscopy with a \"positive\" urine control sample that contains significant numbers of leukocytes (often seen in the buffy coat). Second, only use urine specimens that are fresh and properly processed. Third, be alert for urinary tract infections and other potential clinical problems.\n3. Urianalysis (urinomics) is a microscopic examination of a small sample of human urine, about 1/3 to 2 oz.\nThe microscopic evaluation of the physical properties of an individual's urine is useful as a nonspecific diagnostic aid. It may detect urinary system abnormalities, including kidney disorders, bladder cancer, kidney stones, urinary infections, cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostate enlargement and inflammation. Other problems that could be indicated include hypertension, diabetes mellitus and diabetic kidney disease.\nA urine sample is collected while voiding in what is usually termed a 'clean-catch' collection. After wiping front to back, urine should be caught in sterile container (a small, plastic cup lined with preservative). Then the container is passed to the laboratory for analysis.\nCatheterisation may be used when obtaining a sample from an infant, or a patient who is not able to catch urine in this way, for example patients with problems walking, paralysis, brain and spinal injuries and, in some cases, when cathaerisation is necessary for urological disorders.\nUrine samples must be held at room temperature and transported to a laboratory as quickly as"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5106, "rouge1_r": 0.2462, "rouge1_f1": 0.3322, "rouge2_p": 0.172, "rouge2_r": 0.0825, "rouge2_f1": 0.1115, "rougel_p": 0.2553, "rougel_r": 0.1231, "rougel_f1": 0.1661, "bleurt": 0.3447, "bert_score_p": 0.8529, "bert_score_r": 0.8786, "bert_score_f1": 0.8656, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.2234, "rouge1_r": 0.4038, "rouge1_f1": 0.2877, "rouge2_p": 0.0538, "rouge2_r": 0.098, "rouge2_f1": 0.0694, "rougel_p": 0.117, "rougel_r": 0.2115, "rougel_f1": 0.1507, "bleurt": 0.3234, "bert_score_p": 0.8652, "bert_score_r": 0.8539, "bert_score_f1": 0.8595, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5106, "rouge1_r": 0.1159, "rouge1_f1": 0.189, "rouge2_p": 0.086, "rouge2_r": 0.0194, "rouge2_f1": 0.0316, "rougel_p": 0.2872, "rougel_r": 0.0652, "rougel_f1": 0.1063, "bleurt": 0.3066, "bert_score_p": 0.8035, "bert_score_r": 0.8565, "bert_score_f1": 0.8292, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5213, "rouge1_r": 0.2217, "rouge1_f1": 0.3111, "rouge2_p": 0.0968, "rouge2_r": 0.0409, "rouge2_f1": 0.0575, "rougel_p": 0.2447, "rougel_r": 0.1041, "rougel_f1": 0.146, "bleurt": 0.2987, "bert_score_p": 0.8077, "bert_score_r": 0.8567, "bert_score_f1": 0.8315, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4787, "rouge1_r": 0.1654, "rouge1_f1": 0.2459, "rouge2_p": 0.0968, "rouge2_r": 0.0332, "rouge2_f1": 0.0495, "rougel_p": 0.2872, "rougel_r": 0.0993, "rougel_f1": 0.1475, "bleurt": 0.2908, "bert_score_p": 0.8149, "bert_score_r": 0.8566, "bert_score_f1": 0.8352, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5319, "rouge1_r": 0.1279, "rouge1_f1": 0.2062, "rouge2_p": 0.1183, "rouge2_r": 0.0282, "rouge2_f1": 0.0455, "rougel_p": 0.3404, "rougel_r": 0.0818, "rougel_f1": 0.132, "bleurt": 0.3159, "bert_score_p": 0.8011, "bert_score_r": 0.8466, "bert_score_f1": 0.8232, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334}]}

In a sexual health service 10% to 11% were found to have HSV infection diagnosed during the previous 5 years.\nHSV-2 has a longer incubation period than HSV-I, which is 4 to as long as 9 days from initial exposure to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. In an active outbreak of genital, anal or oral HSV disease, both HSV types can be isolated from lesions. However, in asymptomatic patients, viral cultures are more likely (75%) to be positive for HSV2 than for type I (50%).\nThe likelihood of HSV transmission is greater if the recipient is exposed to someone with active genital lesions than to one with latent infection but the likelihood that someone will transmit infection during a period of latency is unknown.\nAsymptomatic viral shedding can occur frequently, and the time span can vary from no evidence of shedding to >90% positivity within a 6-month observation period.

While some types of Folicutilis are more serious than others, the best treatment for all types is a proper diet and good hygiene.\nSo, what can you do to help your dog with Follictitis?\nFolicultilis is infection of a hair follicle. There are several types but most occur in areas with high amounts of skin cells.\nFor example, people with thick skin on their face are prone to Folicotilis of the eyelids. However, even though Folicitilis can look serious \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be. Let\u2019s dive into the treatment options and what you can do at home.\nHow Does Folilculitis Feel For Dogs?\nDepending on how serious the case is, Folilitilis may be an itchy and uncomfortable condition. Dogs with Folatecula may lick the affected area or may lose their hair.\u00a0\nHowever, if Follicitilis spreads to multiple areas of your pet\u2019s body, they may become very depressed, anxious, or lose a lot of appetite.\u00a0\nAs always, a quick vet visit will help you and your veterinarian pinpoint whether or not this painful condition has progressed to the point where more severe treatment methods are necessary.\nWhat Causes Foliculities In Dogs?\u00a0\nOne important component to treat Foliciitis is to know how or why the disease began in the first place. Here are some common causes of Foliulcus:\nThe skin is usually moist and a little warm.\nAfter using shampoo or other chemicals that might irritate the hair or skin.\nAs Folilocus develops, it spreads out across the top of dogs\u2019 bodies, heads, ears, chest, shoulders, back, legs, tails, rear end, belly, etc. It can cover large areas such as face, neck, behind ears or the chest.\nThe condition may also spread down their back and tailbone regions.\nCan You Prevent A Fluctilitis Outbreak In Your Dog?\nDogs with a propensity for Folikus are likely at greater risk of contracting Folinosis from exposure to certain chemicals or environments. In addition, Follinic infections can easily spread among dogs in a household.\nFollinotic infections should be treated quickly with proper care.

DISCUSSION: This patient was 48 years old with metastases to her peritoneum, but not her liver or lung. Even though chemotherapy appeared to be prolonging her life, the risks of treatment and the uncertainty of its effectiveness was causing her to stop treatment. She requested no further medical interventions and preferred to spend the rest of her time at home with her family and husband rather than in the hospital.\nThe patient, who was married, had children who were grown and out of the house. Her husband, a truck driver with work-related disability, was caring for her at the time. While the patient had good health insurance, no legal documents had been prepared prior to admission. The discussion centers on the impact of stopping chemotherapy as well as the choice not to pursue further treatment.\nThis patient should have received information about hospice when she was initially admitted to the health care system. Although she had an advance directive, it was not known at that time and it should not be assumed that she did not want life prolonged. However, in order to allow the cancer to progress, she felt that chemotherapy would be too costly and would affect the quality of time she still had left with family.\nTo make the decision, information is needed regarding quality-of life considerations: Does the chemotherapy buy the survivor enough time? Is she prepared for the physical sequelae of chemotherapy? How long might the treatment buy? This information needs to incorporate the goals of care for this particular patient. It should include what the future holds, and whether the potential benefit outweighs the possible harms.

How can immunosuppression be treated? Is there a cure for immunodeficency? Can immunotherapy be used to treat immunological disorders? Are there any immunomodulators that can be taken to improve the immune system? Which immunotherapies are available? Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses the body\u2019s immune response to fight cancer. Immunotherapeutic drugs are used in the treatment of cancer, and they are also used as a treatment for other diseases. The immune cells are activated by the drugs, which then attack the cancer cells. This is called immunostimulation. There are two types of immune cell activation: T-cell activation and B-cell stimulation. T-cells are responsible for the production of antibodies, while B-cell stimulation is responsible to produce cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that are produced by immune systems to help fight infections. They are important for fighting cancer because they can kill cancerous cells and prevent them from growing. When the T cells become activated, they produce antibodies that attack cancer cell. These antibodies are called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs are able to kill tumor cells by releasing cytotoxins. In addition to CTL, there are other types immune responses that occur in response of the tumor. One of these responses is the release of cytokine called interleukin-2 (IL- 2). IL- is produced in large amounts by T cell and is important in fighting infections and cancer.\nImmunotherapy for cancer is an emerging field of medicine that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It is based on the idea that the human immune can recognize and destroy cancer tumors. Cancer cells have been shown to be able, in some cases, to evade the normal immune defenses. However, it is possible to use the power of our own immune to attack and kill these cancer tumor.\nThe immune is made up of many different types cells, each with its own function. Some of them are white blood cells that fight infection, others are red blood cell that carry oxygen, still others help to repair damaged tissue. All of this is done by a complex system of signals and responses. If something goes wrong with this system, then the result can often be a disease. For example, if the white cells do not respond properly to an infection then it can lead to a condition called sepsis. Sepsis is when the infection spreads throughout the whole body and can cause death", "The following are some of the most common:\n\u2022 Autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis\n\u2022 Infections such at human immunodeficiency virus\nIf my dog has immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, can he get a second infection or is his immune system shot?\nWhile immune systems are always trying to adapt and improve function, dogs and cats that are immunosuppressed do not have as much protection from diseases as immunecompetent individuals. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a dog or cat that is immuncompromised will absolutely get another disease, but it does mean exposure to disease could occur and it should be considered when they are out in the world.\nDo you know if other dogs are being exposed to the same disease(s)?\nWhen immunecompromises occur, the body loses some protection against disease agents, such animals may be more susceptible to infections not only in their own pet world but in nature. Dogs are exposed on a daily basis to bugs and other pathogens, some harmless, while others may cause illness if the host (the dog!) is vulnerable.\nHow did they get immunotherapy?\nDogs and puppies receive antibodies against many different bacteria via colostrum from their mother\u2019s milk. If a puppy or dog is taken away from the mother before they have finished weaning or if they were not fed adequate colstrums, their immune defenses are lower and they may contract different infections and disorders. Sometimes even mother dogs may not make enough antibodies in colostrom or they can pass along diseases to their offspring.\nIf your loved ones are having trouble, try these four simple steps: \u2022 Eat a balanced diet \u2022 Get enough protein \u2022 Stay away \u2026\nImmune System Boosters?\nEveryone needs an immune boost, either during or after a hard workout or just for general good health. These immune boosting supplements can help you \u2026\nWhat can I do for autoimmune thyroid? | Immune system | Canine", "A person\u2019s immunity to disease may be inadequate for a range of reasons. For example, HIV infections may attack the immune system, preventing B-cells from acting. HIV patients also have lower levels of CD8+ T-cytotoxic T cells, which are crucial for immune defense against virally infected host cells. As a result, these viruses spread unchecked, with the disease known as immunodeficiency.\nHIV Infections May Damage The Immune System\nThe T-regulatory cells protect against autoimmunity and also fight against HIV virus infection. These HIV-infected cells produce the anti-T-cell antibody that destroys T-helper and B cells and destroys CD4 receptors, a key part of the T-cell response to the HIV infection. HIV attacks and uses the CD + 4 (T-helper) cells to replicate itself to produce billions of copies that destroy the body\u2019s system. AIDS is a very serious medical condition for HIV-positive persons. It destroys the protective defenses of a person in any case with HIV and weakens their immune systems. If a CD count (white blood cells that fight infections) drops below 200, an AIDS patient may get sick. Patients with AIDS should not be exposed to anyone with a contagious infection, such as the flu. A flu vaccine or a pneumonia vaccine may also be beneficial to persons who have experienced any type of immune damage. They may require a BCG vaccine (to combat tuberculosis) if they have undergone a bone marrow transplant. The immunosuppressive treatment may help someone survive a serious illness but does not usually treat the cause of their low immunity.\nImmunosurveillance refers to regular immunological monitoring. Tumor immunity is regulated by adaptive and innate immune cells through a continuous dialogue that has long influenced tumor growth. According to recent research, immune evasion is the main cause for tumor outgrowth. Immunosurverillance refers both to constant checking mechanisms and mechanisms that help individuals to recover from disease. Immunodeficiendecy and immunotherapy are used to target such systems in cancer. Cancer therapy, for instance, depends on the modulation of immunogenicity.\nThere may have also been a genetic mutation or exposure to carcinogens. While many immunologically relevant malignancies include tumors, immunologists can learn more about the role of cytokines, growth factors, and other molecules in tumor cell proliferation by using these diseases. Many tumors can be removed from the patient\u2019s body. But immunologist may need to understand why the cells proliferate uncontrollably. In order to", "What are potential symptoms of pneumonia and signs of sepsis? Answer these and more with this guide to clinical signs in pediatric immunology.\nAs with any specialty, immunologists must be aware of the clinical clues of immunological disease and other relevant illnesses. Knowing how to correctly evaluate what could be going on in a case is key for both the student and practitioner. To that end, we\u2019ll go over what clinical features immunodeficiency causes, as well as cover other signs that point to immunologic deficiency. In addition to that, if someone is presenting with symptoms associated with pneumonia, understanding the pathophysiology of infection and septic shock can enhance diagnostic skills and patient care.\nAt the end of this blog, you\u2019ll be more familiar with what immunosuppression is and how it can manifest, and you will know what features to look for that tip one\u2019s hand to certain conditions related to compromised immunity. Whether as a student pursuing your board exams or a doctor studying for recertification, read on to learn more about clinical presentations of compromised immunofunction.\nImmunocompromised state\nWhat is immunopathy?\nImunopathy refers to any condition that alters a person\u2019s immune function. The type of alteration may be of quantity or efficiency, leading to the individual\u2019s susceptibility to infections or other adverse events.\nWhat causes immunopathies?\nA person can have an immunopathty either by not being born with the immune components to battle against foreign invaders, which is what is known as congenital immunodeficencies, or acquire an immune impairment from outside events such as illness, infection, or pharmaceuticals, such which you commonly see in acquired immunoincompetences.\nIn the case of congenitally caused immunedeficiencies, the cause could arise from any of what we know as complement, antibody, cell-mediated immunity, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, humoral immunity or T-cell immunity in the process of maturation or function.\nLet\u2019s go through some of these examples:\nCongenitcal antibody deficiency\nOne type is agammaglobulinemia caused by a nonfunctional B cell, making it impossible for the body to make its own immunoglobulins. It affects both humeral and secondary cell-medicated immunity.\nThis may also be seen in transient hypogammoglobulinaemias, in which children are born without B-cells due to mother\u2019s antibodies being passed on from their mother during fetal development and delivery.\nIn this case", "Is it a lack of lymphocytes, lack in phagoccus? Or maybe some other cause?\nwhat would one expect to see during an active immune response?\nWhat is the process at play during the active or secondary immune responses? What happens in both humoral and cellular responses?\nIf an antibody doesn't bind, how does B cell recognize it, and what happens next?\nThere are 37 alleles at HLA and about 600 types total. How many types do people with one of those alleles, like (human leukocyte antigen A3) have?\nDuring antigen presentation, when are MHC I/II used?\nHow does a lymphocyte get activated? How does the activation work through cytokine signaling?\nIn what ways do antibody- dependent and opsonization complement work?\nDo any of the complement receptors have a transmembrane domain?\nWhere would you expect these complement systems to be used? When would they be activated?\nWhen antigen presents to T cells, what is being presented?\nWhy do T-cells have an antigen receptor that's specific for antigen present by MCH I or MHL II, but it doesn\u2019t have to do with antigen directly interacting with the T-cell receptor. What\u2019s another way of thinking about it?\nDoes antigen presenting cell produce cytokines? And if so, which ones?\nAre there any similarities between the way helper T helper cells work to B cells?\nFor MLC 1, we need the peptide to present and for TCR to recognize for each antigen.\nWhere are each of these found (B cells or T cell)?\nC3a, C4a etc. all activate mast cells to release histamine. And histamines will bind to the C5 a receptor to activate the mast cell, right?\nAnd that causes cytokin release? Are is it different from histamide?\nMHC II is a tetramer consisting of a class II alpha and beta heterodimer, it binds antigen fragment and transports it to cell surface to bind it.\nHow do B-cel receptors work? They look like a molecule that looks similar to an Fc receptor.\nAre they similar in terms of their structure?\nSo is CD8 is part of T CR, part MCh I, or part II?", "Why would this be more common in older adults? What health beliefs can affect immunization? Give examples of 3 immunizations? How do immunizing agents act to cause serofluid? In what ways can a patient be exposed to HIV?\nWhat you need to understand is the concept of immuno-compromise. As adults get older they are at more risk for immunological compromise. What would be examples for that, well we have elderly people because perhaps they were in a place where they had the disease and it was suppressed with certain immune therapy, and the time came when the immunesurpression was lifted and they succumbed.\nThere have been occasions where people have undergone chemotherapy for cancer and that can lead to immunosuppression. So for example there are a lot of diseases that we know can have an effect on immunity. Like, HIV, where the person\u2019s own immune system begins to deteriorate until it\u2019s destroyed. But you have to have some basic principles, that the immune response can be modulated in either direction.\nSo if you don\u2019t have the immunity you\u2019re prone to disease, but if your immune isn\u2019t active enough, say for autoimmune reasons, you may have hypersensitivity reactions to things which in the normal course you wouldn\u2019t.\nAs people age their immune systems deteriorates slightly, so they\u2019re slightly more vulnerable to some types of infections, to viruses or to bacteria. If you get an autoimmune response you will have inflammation you\u2019ll have swelling. Inflammation can sometimes be beneficial. It can also sometimes lead you to a situation where you might have a hypersensitive reaction which you could end up with a shock and die or have organ failure."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3469, "rouge1_r": 0.1241, "rouge1_f1": 0.1828, "rouge2_p": 0.0479, "rouge2_r": 0.0171, "rouge2_f1": 0.0252, "rougel_p": 0.1837, "rougel_r": 0.0657, "rougel_f1": 0.0968, "bleurt": 0.3503, "bert_score_p": 0.8072, "bert_score_r": 0.8087, "bert_score_f1": 0.808, "hallucination": 42.10526315789473, "comprehensive": 68.75}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3469, "rouge1_r": 0.1599, "rouge1_f1": 0.2189, "rouge2_p": 0.0411, "rouge2_r": 0.0189, "rouge2_f1": 0.0259, "rougel_p": 0.1633, "rougel_r": 0.0752, "rougel_f1": 0.103, "bleurt": 0.2735, "bert_score_p": 0.8102, "bert_score_r": 0.816, "bert_score_f1": 0.8131, "hallucination": 84.21052631578947, "comprehensive": 18.75}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3878, "rouge1_r": 0.14, "rouge1_f1": 0.2058, "rouge2_p": 0.0753, "rouge2_r": 0.0271, "rouge2_f1": 0.0399, "rougel_p": 0.1769, "rougel_r": 0.0639, "rougel_f1": 0.0939, "bleurt": 0.3011, "bert_score_p": 0.8126, "bert_score_r": 0.8089, "bert_score_f1": 0.8108, "hallucination": 31.57894736842105, "comprehensive": 68.75}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3401, "rouge1_r": 0.1285, "rouge1_f1": 0.1866, "rouge2_p": 0.0411, "rouge2_r": 0.0155, "rouge2_f1": 0.0225, "rougel_p": 0.1429, "rougel_r": 0.054, "rougel_f1": 0.0784, "bleurt": 0.3074, "bert_score_p": 0.8053, "bert_score_r": 0.813, "bert_score_f1": 0.8091, "hallucination": 15.789473684210526, "comprehensive": 81.25}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.2449, "rouge1_r": 0.1006, "rouge1_f1": 0.1426, "rouge2_p": 0.0137, "rouge2_r": 0.0056, "rouge2_f1": 0.008, "rougel_p": 0.1293, "rougel_r": 0.0531, "rougel_f1": 0.0752, "bleurt": 0.2835, "bert_score_p": 0.78, "bert_score_r": 0.7798, "bert_score_f1": 0.7799, "hallucination": 84.21052631578947, "comprehensive": 12.5}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3333, "rouge1_r": 0.1713, "rouge1_f1": 0.2263, "rouge2_p": 0.0479, "rouge2_r": 0.0246, "rouge2_f1": 0.0325, "rougel_p": 0.1565, "rougel_r": 0.0804, "rougel_f1": 0.1062, "bleurt": 0.319, "bert_score_p": 0.8173, "bert_score_r": 0.7986, "bert_score_f1": 0.8079, "hallucination": 15.789473684210526, "comprehensive": 81.25}]}

It is often seen in association with other skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis vulgaris. This condition is painless, but the skin around it might be itchy, dry, rough or discolored, and it may make you feel self-conscious or insecure about your appearance. Keratosis pilaris typically doesn\u2019t require treatment, and usually fades by age 30. Possible treatments are aimed at preventing excessive skin dryness, including using mild soaps or soap-free cleansers and avoiding hot baths or showers. Treatments include applying on the affected areas an over the counter moisturizer, preferably with ammonium lactate (AmLactin) or with alpha hydroxyl acids (CeraVe), or using topical retinoids such as Tretinoin (Retin-A, Altreno), Adapalene (Differin) and Tazarotene (Arazlo,Tazorac).

This condition is characterized by thick, scaly patches of skin that can be itchy and painful. Keratoses are often found on the hands and feet, but they can also occur on other parts of the body. There are many different types of Keratoacanthoma, each with its own set of symptoms. Some people may only experience mild symptoms, while others may have more severe symptoms that require medical attention. If you think you may be suffering from Keratitis, please consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\nWhat is Keratis?\nKeratis is the medical term for a type of hair loss that affects the scalp. The condition can occur in both men and women, although it is more common in women. Symptoms of this condition include hair thinning, bald patches, or a receding hairline. In some cases, the hair may also become brittle and break easily. Treatment for Keritis typically involves using topical medications or taking oral supplements. Surgery may sometimes be necessary if the condition does not respond to other treatments.\nKerotin is one of many types Kerotin, which is also known as Keratomycosis. Other types include Keratonycositis, Keratorrhagia, Kerauniaxis, etc. All these conditions are characterized with the presence of a thickened, waxy layer on top of your skin.

These conditions usually occur due to excessive exposure to sunlight or other environmental factors such as heat, cold, humidity, wind, dust, chemicals, radiation, trauma, infection, inflammation, stress, poor nutrition, lack of sleep, alcohol consumption, smoking, drugs, medications, cosmetics, jewelry, tattoos, piercings, implants, prostheses, braces, dentures, crowns, bridges, fillings etc.\nHow to treat Keritosis?\nThere are a few different ways to go about treating Keritos. One option is to use topical creams or ointments that contain ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Another option would be to take oral medications like antibiotics or antifungals. Finally, you could also try using natural", "Can You Get Rid of it?\nI bet you've heard this name before or maybe not. Keratin Pilerosis are little red to brown bumps around hair follicle, small white spots all on your body, hands, arms, legs, and even your back.\nIt is a skin irritation or keratotic plug that appears on the hair and follicles especially seen on a young age. Sometimes also called 'chicken skin'.\u00a0\nKeratins are very much common in both men and women and there a reason why.

Lemon Juice:\nKeratostis piliatis is often associated with excess sebum and dead skin clogging the hair follicles.\nTherefore, getting rid of dead cells and sebitum is essential for curing kerastocis pyloris.\nA lemon juice soak in dead sebrum and excess dead cell removal may be of help for people with keratoscitis pyloria.\nLemon juice has citric acid, and this can help reduce your clogged pores. If you have dry keratin, lemon juices can also increase your skin elasticity.\nSo, try to massage lemon oil (you can ask it in your neighborhood) into your kerotosis pylorious areas and washes it off. A gentle exfoliating scrub with a little bit of lemon can be quite relieving, especially if applied weekly.\nAnother great use of a natural remedy for KP:\nLime is the best citrus fruit for treating keratorosis plylria.\nMix a fresh lime with honey and massage on your face. Leave on for 20 minutes before washing off.\nIt can effectively treat KP and help you remove dead surface cells. You may also use honey as a great scrub, with the use lemon in it\nIf you are suffering from keratomycosis phyloria, then using yogurt and rice flour in a paste works great.\nYou need to rub this paste well on the affected areas, while massaging your body in this way, it will also work as body scrub. Try to exlore the whole body once a week.\n4.

The condition may not be treatable, so individuals should know what it is.\nIt\u2019s usually an indicator of a dry skin barrier. It may appear on any part of your body, such as your thighs and backs. The name of this particular condition also refers to what\u2019s called a kerating.\nIn some cases the problem is that dry, chapping skin that happens as you\u2019re doing certain things, like shaving or scratching yourself. Your body\u2019s natural production of natural oils and sweat help maintain moisture balance in your outer membrane.\nA common misnomer is \u201cdry skin.\u201d If you live in an area that\u2019s dry (like the Midwest or Western United States), or if you bathe too infrequently (especially in front of air conditioning), you have dry\nskin. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to buy or order a lotion. Instead, use an alcohol-free lotion.\nThis is an interesting question as", "Can It Be Cured?\nKeratocysts are a type of skin condition called keratotic cysts. In simple terms, these are cystic nodules just below the surface of the skin. They are often harmless but need treatment if they have been formed due to a disease or underlying health issue.\nThey come in different colors and can be found anywhere on the body. Some of them are so small that they look like whiteheads while some of others are as large as your fist and look exactly like cauliflower. A few of these types include keratoacanthomas, keratinous cyst, and keratoses. If you have any question about these kinds of conditions, read on for more information.\nIf you look carefully at the photograph of a Keratinaceous cyst above, you will notice a small white patch on your finger.\nThese bumps are usually soft and flat. You'll notice them primarily on areas that are not exposed to the sun (like your elbows). They may also show up on places where you're always touching - such as near your fingers. Keratosen is another type that appears only when pressure is applied to certain points on or under the epidermis.\nYou may feel like these cyst are painful but they aren't. Often times, they don't cause any kind of discomfort either.\nWhat Is A Keratitis?\nIt's an infection of some sort. There are several kinds, including: Streptococcal keratitis,\nBacterial keratachesis-which is caused by a certain type or mixt of bacteria. Staphylococci, for instance,\nNon-bacterial infections, or keratomycosis (inflammation caused directly by fungal forms).\nSome people say that keratatosis pilarus is a form of eczema because its causes can't be traced back to specific cells in the immune system. But that's not true! It actually grows inside dead cells called basal cells. The reason why people thought it was linked to eczemais because many people who get keratas pila are also affected by it.\nCan The Cure For KP Ever Really Work?\nMany patients would probably tell you that the condition goes away on its own as the age progresses. However, there isn\u2019t much evidence of this happening! As we age, our bodies become less sensitive to irritation and infection. With time, other cells take over (such as in wrinkles).

I believe that this is some sort of a brain stem headache because when he eats alot of carbohydrates it increases the size of headaches..this is just what I beleive by watching him over the years. He has seen Dr.'s that have tried all sorts of medicines...Iv fluids, heparin, toradol shots, dilaudid...he was in and out of hospitals and every time the medications would help but only a few days...then the headaches would kick back in..he had an MRI and a CT scan and they said his brain looked normal...that was before they knew what cluster headaches really were. His Dad and I and the doctors have no clue what to do, we have been through so much to help him..any suggestions is well taken..Thanks, Mom of 2 sons.\nWhen I told my 1st doc. that my headache got better when laying in bed on my stomach (it hurt the most if I tilted my head to one side) he blew me off. If you get better leaning one way stop doing that. It will make it worse. Then after going to other Dr.s who kept insisting I was fine even tho I got migraines at least once a week, one finally had me get a CAT SCAN.

So it is right sided cluster headaches I suppose.\nHave been getting a lot of visual aures too, but when I go to bed at night, they always start off on my left side, slowly moving to the right. The aura are kind of weird and not like the normal ones that I have read up a bit on. I get the headache first usually, it just starts on one cheek and the entire top of my head tingles and burns, and my right eye seems to get droopy, I see a white haze over everything, if I try to close my eye, the pressure is unbelievable and I can't. As the aura continues, my entire head and neck is very hot and tingly. After the two phases, its a blinding headache. All this can happen in seconds. And it can last for hours!!!

I am wondering why the auros start on the left and move over?\nAnd why are there tingling sensations everywhere but the eye???\nComments for Whats a Cluster Headache?!\nThe two pictures are great for a general understanding of what happens in cluster head. Keep looking at them and seeing what you can learn from them.\nThe trigminel nerve splits into three sections. One of these splits off before reaching the side of your face and innervates all the muscles in your eye including the eyelid. When the nerve is damaged on that side you get that drooping eyelids as you said. Also look for your ability to move that same eye downwards. That is the other muscle that is innerved by the trigeminel. This gives us a clue to our own eye problems. Our right and left eyes do not work exactly the same. Therefore they may show different signs. Your pain and numbness on your right face should give you a hint to start there. But your left eye is still involved too.\nI hope this helps.

(See also Lyme Protocol 7) I do remember taking Echinacea many years ago, but I don't think it was an extract I took on a daily basis to treat an infection. I am also not quite sure about that \"dysentery\" mentioned above. Should the fact that I have had no antibiotic treatment for a period of time (a \"lupus hiatus\" in short) make a difference, considering that the reason I stopped was because my Dr wanted to monitor me to see how my body would react after all that antibiotic usage? I guess the main question is: Am I at increased risk for developing a serious bacterial infection from the E. coli?\nIt depends greatly on your immune function. If your own body can fight off the infection, no, a couple bottles of this wouldn't be a problem. But some are compromised and will not. Antibiotics have a bad reputation, that's partially because they are over prescribed and also because taking multiple courses of them actually weakens the effectiveness - over exposure to a bacteria will cause it to change and become stronger. And of course it also kills off good bacteria, leading to gut problems like candida.", "This is an absolutely great question for you.\nI am guessing that you have been infected by Lyme disease? And right now, you are confused about what you can do to get rid of it.\nWell, if you use antibiotics to treat your infection, it is not going to do anything beneficial because it won\u2019t make it go away. You will have to wait for all the symptoms to start coming out.\nThe antibiotic is a very useful method to kill bacteria. If you get a cut, and it gets infected, then your doctor will provide you with an antibiotic.\nIt kills the bacteria in your body to stop the harm and keep you healthy and safe. In this case, the benefit of the antibiotic disappears from the equation because of Lyme, which is spread by ticks.\nHowever, Lyme is one disease that only comes after tick bites, not bacteria, but bacteria that the Lyme brings with the virus.\nThis is the only reason why your typical antibiotics are not as effective when treating lymes because bacteria doesn\u2019t cause them. It may treat a single illness, or it could turn lethal if not done correctly.\nDo you still believe that antibiotics help for Lyme Disease?\nThe tick, along with Lyme bacteria (bacteria spirochetic), enters the skin during a tick bite. That same bacterium travels up along the same nerve path that it came with.\nWhat are the results? A lot of pain. Antibiotics are given to the patient to deal with that pain.\nIf the pain was the sole indication, antibiotics would be helpful. The antibiotic may help get the disease under control (or not) and reduce pain temporarily (for the initial 24 hours). But that\u2019s it; the sickness continues.\nIs there research available to support antibiotic treatment?\nTo support the treatment of antibiotics against Lyme and co-occurring diseases, they need to have research. But these antibiotics will not be useful. No, I am not joking.\nTo prove their point, researchers are using an animal model to verify the idea of antibiotic-induced infection of lymers.\nThey found that when the spore in the brain was taken up by livers, ticks died rapidly. However, lames that developed in spores and tick saliva spread throughout the body.\nIn fact, some ticks can spread a spironchete on both limbs, while no Lyme can be produced. Because Lymphs are carried more by saliva, Lymed infection is generally believed to be fatal.\nAntibiotics have no effect on Ly", "(the antibiotics are used as prophylaxis).\nHi, i read your article about lymes disease and antibiotics prophilaxis. However, as i understood lymedisease is not a bacterial infection? How does bacteria get in to the body and why do the antiobiotics then help to prevent disease.\nBacteria cause Lyme disease. Antibiotics such as doxycycline and amoxicillin are the most recommended antibiotic treatment for Lyme Disease if caught in the early stages.\nI am currently writing a paper on Lyme\u2019s, I\u2019m still working my way around trying to find more and better sources, but I was wondering if you knew the actual mechanism in which antibiotics kill off bacteria?\nWe know that antibiotics bind to bacterial cell walls and alter the permeability, or the function of what cells do in order to grow and create toxins. I just need to figure out if the binding and disruption of cell wall functions are what kill the bacteria.\nAlso do you think that this could be an evolutionary benefit for pathogens?\nI know it makes them more susceptible against antibiotics but it also weakens or kills them. It just seems like an imperfect mechanism to me and I would like to further investigate.\nIf I can help I\u2019d be more than happy to! Thanks again!\nLyme, the disease itself is caused by a tick. The bacteria living in ticks cause the illness.\nTetragenicity is an antibiotic ability to inhibit the growth of the pathogen.\nWe all have bacteria in our bodies. All the more reason not to take antibiotics.\nWhat are antibiotics? They kill bacteria, which is a natural defense mechanism of our body.\nTherefore, why would I let them kill my own good bacteria with antibiotics when I am just killing the pathogens inside me by the use of antibiotics?\nBACTERIA, VIRUS and PARASITES DO NOT CREATE ILLNESS!\nBacterias, viruses, and parasites are just the symptoms of illnesses!\nOur bodies have the natural ability of balancing the microorganisms in us. Therefore, our natural state is that we do not have any bacteria. Bacteria just live on our surfaces, so they can take advantage of some chemical substance which we produce.\nIn conclusion, everything that comes in contact with your body will create sickness, including the air, food, water, dust. So why are you taking antibiotics to treat your immune system?", "Does it do the job better than the herbal treatment?\nThere isn't a \"one treatment fits all\" approach to Lyme Disease.

Is this rate high for someone over weight. Please tell me if being over weighted might cause a high resting h\nHi @kayy,\nThank you for your question. Heart rate and over-weight are closely intertwined, but the cause may be different. When we are active, we have more energy requirements, and burn fats to get the energy that we need. Over-weight people are more likely to increase their calorie in-take, even when they don\u2019t need to.\nWe also use glucose for energy, while fats are a secondary store. We know that our body does not metabolize fat as readily as glucose, so the metabolism (breaking down) of fats takes energy. That means that over a period of time, the amount of calories we burn to break down the fats could in turn burn our sugars more quickly. This explains the increased weight in people who are on fat rich diets.\nIn this case, your increased heart-rate may not be the result of over-activity, excess in exercise, or being sick. The excess over eating could also be affecting your heart. Your body needs a balance of food and energy to stay healthy, there are other considerations for weight gain, like eating food too rich in carbs and proteins. These, along with the over-consumption of fat, could all have the same effect on your body.\nThe more your weight goes up, chances of your resting-heart rate also going up. But, it won\u2019t be a linear function, in that your height, build, size, etc., can increase/decrease the heart to beat faster or take a longer time to reach the resting point. Therefore, if you want to know the effect that fats have on the metabolic functioning of the body, you should know your BMI (body mass index), your calorie burn rate, weight and compare it to a standard. You also want look for any trends when you are feeling or active sick, for instance, with a flu, a respiratory infection, stomach bug, urinary infections, food poisoning and so on. By monitoring both your activity and sickness levels, over time you can get a better picture of what is causing your heartbeat to feel high.", "I have heard both yes and no answers from different sources.\nThere are two things to consider:\nHeart rate is determined by cardiac output, which is the amount of blood pumped per heartbeat. (Cardiac output = heart beat times stroke volume \u2013 the volume of individual blood pumps)\nWhen one is overweight, it can strain the heart to pump blood through the body, resulting in a higher output of cardiac activity \u2013 that is an increase in heart beats per time unit (higher hear rate).\nHowever, one may also compensate for the extra work by pumping a little less blood in each individual pump (decrease in stroke size), which will in turn counteract the higher heart rates.\nThe heart is able to adjust to different situations, and therefore it may be difficult to tell whether someone whose heart race increases when running around, is running because of the overload on the muscles and heart, or if the person is simply compensating.\nTo better understand this it is good to visualize what happens during an intense situation.\nMuscles use oxygen to work. Blood carries both the oxygen you have received from the lungs, as well as the carbon dioxid you produce in the process of breathing. Carbon dioxids diffuse out of muscle cells into the capillaries while oxygen diffuses into cells from capillary blood.\nBecause of this the rate of circulation to the part of your body that uses a lot of energy in, for example, running, may temporarily be higher. This is why we get a raised heart and breathing rate when we are working out.\nThis does not imply that the increased speed (and thus extra energy spent in muscle) make the blood circulation faster. Remember, blood flow takes the same time everywhere in your vascular system, the arterial system as long as in veins. The work of keeping the circulation going does, however, cost the cardiac muscle energy. And as an example to how the cardiovascular system is adapted to cope with high effort, the muscle mass around the legs of a distance runner is known to be large, because this is what allows the runner to run faster over a long time with lower cardiac and muscle fatigue. In other words, to save the brain and the other organs from lacking oxygen it has become a necessary investment to increase the vascular muscle size.\nIn the case of overweight the reason to have a larger cardiac mass is probably not related only to compensate increased circulation in legs and muscles, but that it needs to circulate blood around other areas of increased weight such as stomach and body fat.", "If so, what should I do about it?!

Although there is also a Herpers infection that can affect the skin around the nose and mouth in the form of tiny blisters. This condition affects infants, and can be very painful. Hope this helps you!!\nMouth soars and herpes can appear inside the cheeks, on gums, in inner surfaces of lips and sometimes on palate. Mouth soare may appear in between teeth and on corners of mouth too. Herpe's in turn appear as small soares with no pain.

Usually they will clear up in a day or two-unless both eyes are involved.\nDoes the discharge look the same color as the other eye or is it thicker and opaque and not the clear stuff that all their tears are? Usually a serious corneeal injury will have a lot of thick discharge that looks more opaque or milky rather than a thick gooey discharge with the color the kitty sheds...if one eye is much worse than the rest, this may be a sign of infection...and they usually don't want to blink unless its a true corial infection so your kitty is doing the hard work. If the injury is deeper and a real tear of the ocular surface, you may not see discharge, but rather a reddish discoloration, because the iris is exposed.\nAs to \"clearing up\" it really depends on how deep and involved the infection is.

However, most corneoal abrsions heal within 24 hours, with no infection or other complication. Therefore, you have not infection and there shouldn't be any dischaarge from your injury.

Unless one has a problem with the tear ducts and tear drains into the nose the only drainage would be from under the lids and into a towel, so there would not to my knowledge be a steady drip.\nYes. A cornea abrasions from foreign material or injury typically results in significant pain followed by tearing, redness and drainage. The drainage is a good sign that treatment is working as your eye is able to clean itself.

It is not a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It can be caused by a change in the normal balance of bacteria in your vagina.\nWhat is Bv? BV is a common condition caused when the balance between good and bad bacteria is upset. The good bacteria, Lactobacillus, normally keeps the bad ones in check. When the good ones are not present in sufficient numbers, the other bacteria can grow out of control. This can cause an unpleasant fishy odor and a gray or white discharge. BV can also cause itching and burning in and around the vaginal area. If you have BV, you may also have a burning sensation when you urinate. You may have an increased risk of getting BV if you: Have multiple sex partners Have a new sex partner Have had a sex\nWhat are the symptoms of Bacteriavaginitis? The symptoms may include: A grayish-white or yellowish discharge from the vulva and vagina A fish-like odor, especially after sex or during your period Pain or burning when urinating Pain during sex Itching around your vulvar area Redness or swelling of the skin around or inside your vaginal opening\nHow is BV treated? There are several ways to treat BV. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to kill the bacteria that are causing the infection. These antibiotics are usually taken for 7 days. Some women may need to take the antibiotics for a longer period of time. Other treatments include vaginal creams or suppositories. Vagina creams are applied directly to the inside of your\nvagina. Suppositories are inserted into your rectum. Both of these treatments are used to help kill off the harmful bacteria. There is no cure for BV but there are ways that you can help prevent it from coming back. Here are some tips: Avoid douching. Douches can upset the natural balance in\nyour vagina and make it more likely for you to get BV again. Use condoms during sexual intercourse. Condoms can protect you from getting sexually\ntransmitted diseases (STIs) and help keep your partner from passing BV to you. Avoid using scented soaps, bubble baths, or\npowders in or around\nthe vaginal\narea. They can irritate the\nskin and cause\ninflammation. Wear cotton underwear. Cotton allows your skin to breathe and helps keep the area dry. Change your underwear daily. Wipe from front to back after using", "What Do I do with these Vicious Little Infections?\nA couple of recent studies have shown the importance of being able to distinguish vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, from bacteria vaginose, and candidiasis. The first, which came out of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, followed 2,000 African American women for 10 years, with the results showing BV to be more common than T. V. and equally more serious. In fact, T.v. seemed to have no direct relationship with pregnancy or STD's, but BV did. Researchers found more women suffering from BV had HIV and other communicable diseases, suggesting that the infection can weaken the immune system. What is not so popularly known, is that even vaginal infections with no apparent symptoms may be just as dangerous, because the vaginal wall is so extremely thin and delicate. We all know of STD' s being spread through intercourse, or having children with defects and birth difficulties. Well, this research is showing that a seemingly harmless infection like BV can have more immediate consequences than we ever thought possible. But the other fact researchers are talking about is, what are the causes of BV? Is sexual transmission of bacteria a possibility? And can BV play a part in the spread of T.V. infection and or other STDs, such as HPV. This is a topic on which more research should be carried out. And the fact is also there, there is no guarantee that symptoms will show up, making the diagnosis difficult. However, if symptoms do show themselves, they consist of an off-putting, whitish brown vaginal discharge. If you do get this, you may notice itching and burning during and after urination, along with a fishy odor, as well as changes in your vagina's PH levels. It also could cause more problems, like a lower immune defense to other infections and even HIV. All these symptoms, however, should not cause you unnecessary distress. There are a number of things you can do on your own when you first notice these signs. First of all, washing the genital area everyday before sex may prevent the bacteria from getting established, particularly if using a vaginal douche, containing vinegar and water to clean the infected area. Also, a product called \"Glycine\" which is found in cranberry juice, has proved to work well.

The etiologic agent is Gardnerella vaginalis, which is a gram variable coccus found on both epithelium and in vaginal secretions. Women affected by this STD present with intense vagal itching and burning. A gray homogeneous vaginal discharge, often described as fishy odor, is observed especially in women with poor hygiene\nHow many STD's are there? I don't know. I would venture to guess at least 40. But at any given time there are five common ones.\nThese five STD are Chlamydia (C), Gonorrhea (G), Herpes (H), Syphilis (S), and Human Papillomas Virus (P). Other sexually transmitted diseases include: bacterial (B), human immunodeficiency (human immunocology disease virus (AIDS): A), hepatitis (L), genital warts (W), molluscum contagiosum (M), HIV (N), chancroid (K), lymphogranuloma iverulentum STD (I), public lice (R", "This is what you need.\nThe answer to is Bv an std is very simple. It is not Bacteria vaginiosis, while it is a condition related to the vaginal area, the answer is easy no. There are certain conditions that will happen when a person gets BACTERIA VAGINOSIS, but it isn\u2019t a sexually transmitted disease. If you haven\u2019t had any sex lately, it may still be worth looking into other options for getting rid of this problem, as there are other causes that could result in this condition. The first thing is to know what causes it and how to treat it.\nThis is the most common causes of bacterial vaginitis is in fact the use of spermicides, which contains sperm killers. Another problem is that many people use spermicidal spermicide when they have sex, and then take their partners down with them and their own sperm in the vagina.\nBacterial vagisosis is also caused as a result of a weakened immune system as well as other types of infections, such as yeast infections can be caused by Candida, this is where the bacteria can get the upper hand against us.\nThere are some things to look for when you first think about getting B. V. Some things will be more likely than others for you to get BV. One of these is if you are sexually active and are engaging in regular sexual intercourse, then there is an increased chance, of getting it because of being exposed to so much. This virus is often passed around between sexual partners.\nIf you suspect you might have it, make sure you get yourself tested, whether by yourself, or your healthcare provider. You can do a home test, you can also go to your local gynecologist and ask him or her.\nWhen you look at whether or not it can affect a man, there isn't too much information about this. However, for women this appears to be a fairly common condition and often occurs after they become sexually involved for the first time.\nOne of the main reasons why it\u2019s important to have this disease treated early is because it affects fertility. While it won\u2019t cause infertility right away, women who contract this are at a higher risk of developing pregnancy at some point in their life, however, when left untreated, men will find it much easier to develop the condition.\nYou may notice that even though you\u2019ve been using a sperm killing device to aid in vaginal discharge, that it doesn\u2019t really work anymore. They have been used successfully in", "No.\nBacterial vaginiosis is a condition that affects your vagina. It\u2019s caused by overgrowth of a type of bacteria in the vagina.\nThis type\u00a0of\u00a0growth makes your vaginal discharge smell fishy. Bv is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI). But some doctors still\u00a0call it a\u00a0sexually transmitted disease (STD)\nIf you have bacterial vag,\u00a0its easy to treat, and your infection won\u2019t have any permanent effects.\nSigns and symptoms include a strong vaginal odor that is often described as an order of fish. Other symptoms are changes in vaginal fluid or\u00a0increased vaginal\u00a0discharge.\nThere are several factors that can increase your risk of getting bv like douching and having sexual partners.\nHow do you get bv?\nThis is the most common cause of bacterial\u00a0vaginitis. Having sex with a man increases the odds of contracting bv, although you don\u2019t need to have a new or multiple sexual\npartners to get bacterial viginosis.\nYou can get a bacterial infection through kissing, having oral or anal sex, or sharing vaginal dildos.\u00a0Also, many people don't realize their sex partners may also have the infection.\nBut BV isn\u2019t generally contagious, so you can\u2019t catch it from someone else\nYou\u00a0 can\u00a0 contract BV from sex and sharing toys. Some people become infected after having unprotected sex. But most of the time, you cannot prevent bv by using a condom.\nIs Bacteria Viginis the same thing as Vagina Smells Like Fish?\nThe smell from bv is similar to the \u201cfishy\u201d smell of vagninits and this is why it\u2019s not usually an easy condition to spot.\nAlthough BV is usually more mild then yeast infections, women can have both infections at the some time\nBV affects women of all ages, but some are more prone than others are. You will notice in young women before the age of 20.

The long-term use of any product should be monitored. Also, if the rash was caused by the pepper, you may be allergic to it. Don't smoke with capsaicin (sp) on your skin, it will give you worse pains in it and anywhere else on you.\nIf it is a reoccuring rash, then you might have an allergy to the peppers (or maybe just the variety of pepper you used) or some type of reaction to them on top of some other allergy. You really need to check with your doctor.\nThe acid thing was probably a placebo effect. It should work, but it won't \"cure\" you anything except stop the diarrhea or whatever you were using it for.\nSorry but I have never tried IM modium but the people who sell it at the pharmacy said try a bottle and see how it goes, no prescription needed.

Some produce mushrooms and toadstools, but most of them, such as those that cause ring worm, are not seen until they develop on the surface of some other living thing, especially humans.\nRingworm is usually caused by the micro-organisms called fungi, which live on dead skin, hair, cuticles, scalp, nails, etc. and it may be visible with skin lesions, itchy scalp and in some cases it will not cause rash as fungi can be easily killed as they are sensitive to several medications.
