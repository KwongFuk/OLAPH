Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer.

However, they should not be used for more than 2-3 days at a time. Frequent or prolonged use can cause \"rebound congestion\" when the decongestant is stopped, which can lead to a cycle of dependency on decongestant sprays. Their short-term use means they are better for treating nasal congestion caused by a cold rather than allergies.\n\nNasal irrigation or saline sprays can rinse out mucus and allergens from the nasal passages. Elevation of the head at night may help as congestion is sometimes worse when lying down.\n\nOral decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), are also available.

{"Question": "Do bananas help with diarrhea?", "Free_form_answer": "When experiencing diarrhea, bananas can be helpful due to their high content of pectin and starch. Green bananas contain even more pectin and starch than ripe ones, making them even more beneficial. However, fresh fruits and vegetables should be avoided, except for bananas, as they may worsen diarrhea. Bananas are also a good source of potassium, which helps to replace lost nutrients. A long-term restrictive diet like the \"BRAT\" diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) may provide suboptimal nutrition and should not be used for more than 24 hours. In addition, in cases of diarrhea, it is recommended to avoid dairy products since lactose, a type of sugar present in dairy, can worsen symptoms.

Ye see, viruses be sneaky devils, and they can lurk in the air, on surfaces, and even on yer own skin! So, ye might've picked it up from touchin' yer own face, or from breathin' in the air after someone else with the infection coughed or sneezed.\n\nAnother possibility be that yer housemates be immune to the particular strain o' virus that's got ye feelin' like a bilge rat. Ye see, our bodies be like ships, and they've got their own defenses against invaders like viruses. So, if yer housemates have had the same virus before, or if they've got a strong immune system, they might not be gettin' infected, even if they're around ye.\n\nAnd then there be the chance that ye're just plain unlucky, matey!

But, me hearty, it don't always affect both directions o' movement. Sometimes, the tendon be more prone to strain in one direction, like extension, and not the other.\n\nFor example, if ye be a swabbie who spends a lot o' time haulin' up the Jolly Roger, ye might develop tendinitis in yer shoulder's extensor tendons, makin' it hard to lift yer arm up, but not affectin' yer ability to bend it down.\n\nSo, to answer yer question, aye, it be normal fer tendinitis to only affect one direction o' movement, like extension or flexion.

Well, matey, I be tellin' ye, it be a mighty fine question!\n\nAye, it be quite common fer tendinitis to only affect one direction o' movement, like extension or flexion. This be because o' the way the tendons and ligaments be structured, matey. Ye see, tendons be like ropes that connect muscles to bones, and they be designed fer specific movements. So, if ye be doin' a lot o' extension, like liftin' yer arm up high, ye might get tendinitis in the tendon that connects the muscle to the bone that be movin' in that direction.\n\nBut, matey, don't ye be thinkin' that just 'cause it be affecting one direction, it be a sign o' somethin' bein' wrong with yer overall joint or muscle. No, no, no! It be just a sign o' wear and tear, like the ropes on yer trusty ship gettin' frayed from all the sailin' ye be doin'!\n\nSo, what be the best way to treat tendinitis, ye ask?

Tendinitis be a curse o' the sea, er, I mean, a curse o' the joints! And ye be right, it be common for it to affect only one direction o' movement, like extension or flexion, instead o' both.\n\nNow, I be no doctor, but I've heard that tendinitis be caused by repetitive strain, poor posture, or even a bit o' wear and tear on the tendons. And when it affects only one direction, it be usually because o' the way the tendon be aligned or the way ye be usin' yer joint.\n\nFor example, if ye be a swabbie who spends all day climbin' the riggin', ye might develop tendinitis in yer elbow joint, but only when ye be extendin' yer arm to grab the ropes. That be 'cause the tendon be gettin' all worn out from the repetitive strain o' straightenin' yer arm.\n\nBut don't ye worry, matey! There be ways to treat tendinitis, even if it be only affectin' one direction. Ye can try stretchin', strengthenin', and restin' yer joint, and if it be bad enough, ye might need to see a doctor for some proper treatment.\n\nSo hoist the sails and set course for a life o' healthy joints, me hearty!

It be caused by repetitive strain or overuse o' the affected joint, leadin' to inflammation o' the tendon.\n\nNow, I know what ye be thinkin': \"Pirate, why would it only affect one direction and not both?\" Well, me hearty, it be because the tendons be specialized fer specific movements. For example, the tendon that controls extension o' the wrist be different from the one that controls flexion.\n\nSo, if ye be doin' a lot o' extension movements, like liftin' heavy anchors or swabbin' the decks, ye might develop tendinitis in that specific tendon. But if ye be doin' a lot o' flexion movements, like climbin' the riggin' or swabbin' the poop deck, ye might not develop tendinitis in the same tendon.\n\nBut don't ye worry, matey!

In fact, it be more common than ye might think! When tendinitis strikes, it usually be caused by repetitive strain or overuse, and it can affect any joint that relies on tendons to move.\n\nNow, tendons be made o' tough, fibrous tissue that connects muscles to bones.

Tendons be like ropes that connect yer muscles to yer bones, and they be designed fer specific movements.\n\nExtension tendinitis, in particular, be more common than flexion tendinitis, especially in the elbows and knees.

{"Question": "Is there anything I can do about feeling like Im going to pass out?", "Free_form_answer": "Fainting is a brief loss of consciousness caused by a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. In healthy individuals, fainting is possible for various reasons, like not eating or drinking enough, standing for long periods, standing up too quickly, or experiencing emotional stress. Identifying the triggers that cause this sensation can help reduce the frequency of fainting episodes. Additionally, when you feel like you might faint, certain techniques can improve the blood flow to your brain and prevent you from fainting. These include lying down if possible, sitting and placing your head between your knees, squeezing your thighs together, and crossing your legs and arms.

{"Question": "My cat was just diagnosed with a tapeworm, could that be something I can get from him?", "Free_form_answer": "It is possible to contract a tapeworm from an infected cat, although it is not common. There are two types of tapeworms that can infect cats. The most prevalent type is Dipylidium caninum, which does not directly infect humans. Ingesting a flea that is infected with the tapeworm is the only way humans can contract it, and it usually happens through close contact between children and their infected pets. The second type of tapeworm is Echinococcus multilocularis, which is less common in cats. This tapeworm can be transmitted to humans by ingesting feces from an infected animal. To reduce the risk of contracting these tapeworms, it is essential to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after handling your cat and its feces.

{"Question": "What does a low pulse possibly indicate?", "Free_form_answer": "It is normal for an adult to have a pulse rate of 60-100 beats per minute (bpm). If the pulse rate falls below 60 bpm, it is known as bradycardia (low pulse). Bradycardia can be a normal physiological response in healthy individuals during sleep, endurance athletes, and older patients. However, it can also be a symptom of an underlying disease such as obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, infectious diseases, central nervous system conditions, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, anorexia, and hypoxia. Certain drugs like calcium channel blockers, lithium, opioids, and beta blockers can also cause bradycardia.

{"Question": "What is sciatica", "Free_form_answer": "Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the sciatic nerve path due to sciatic nerve injury or irritation. The most common cause of sciatica is compression of the sciatic nerve root by a herniated disc in the spine. Classically, the pain affects one side of the body and radiates from the buttock down the back of the leg to below the knee. The pain can be described as burning or stabbing and may be accompanied by paresthesia (tingling), numbness, or weakness. Symptoms may worsen with twisting, bending, sneezing, or coughing. It is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic pain and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging studies may be recommended if symptoms persist for >6 weeks or weakness or numbness is experienced. The risk of developing sciatica can be reduced by maintaining good posture and healthy weight, regular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and proper lifting techniques. Mild sciatica usually resolves in a few weeks. The following conservative approaches may help relieve pain and speed up recovery: cold or heat packs, over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, and starting gentle exercise as soon as tolerated. Contact your healthcare advisor if symptoms do not improve after a few weeks, worsen, or stop you from doing your normal activities.

{"Question": "Will the antibiotics prevent the lyme disease from progressing?", "Free_form_answer": "Antibiotic treatment is most effective in preventing the progression of Lyme disease when started in the early stage, which is usually characterized by an expanding circular red rash and flu-like illness. Within 20 days of starting treatment, most patients experience a complete resolution of signs and symptoms. However, antibiotics may not be as effective in later stages of the disease, and symptoms may persist. In such cases, some patients may need a second course of antibiotic therapy.

{"Question": "Would you recommend something a bit stronger than meloxicam?", "Free_form_answer": "There are generally three main types of drugs used for pain management: acetaminophen (paracetamol), NSAIDs (like Meloxicam), and opioids.

Opioids such as Tramadol (Conzip) and Oxycodone (Oxyado, Oxycontin) are the most potent but carry a significant risk of addiction, toxicity, and cognitive and respiratory adverse effects. In case of acute and severe pain, NSAIDs like Meloxicam are often recommended.

It is important to note that your healthcare provider may not immediately prescribe antibiotics. In some cases, a wait-and-see approach is taken as the symptoms can resolve on their own.
