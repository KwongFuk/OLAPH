(Some branches of Christianity, notably Catholicism, believe that humankind inherited a predisposition to sinfulness through the fall of Adam and Eve.)In terms of mainstream biology, original sin is not a plausible hypothesis.Nor, if we were to observe it, could we say that it is a scientifically valid theory.Unlike the inheritance of physical traits, we do not observe people \"inheriting\" behavioral traitudes through direct transmission from parents.Even if such a mechanism were demonstrated, behavioral genetic studies suggest that most complex behaviors--including both good and evil--are the results of the interaction of multiple genes with the environment.This means that no single gene (including a sin gene) would be directly responsible for an individual's sinful ways.Individual sins would have to be attributed to specific circumstances, which would make them extrinsic to the genes and therefore difficult to ascribe to a single inherited tendency.Moreover, even if original sin existed, its biological plausibility is questionable.After all, there is no clear pathway by which such a mechanism could influence the two separated spheres of the spiritual and the physical.In conclusion, we can say that original sin is a matter for theology, not biology."}
