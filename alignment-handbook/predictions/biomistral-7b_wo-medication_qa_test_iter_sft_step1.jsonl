Magnesium deficiency can lead to a variety of health problems, including muscle cramps, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and heart rhythm disturbances. Magnesium chelation involves combining magnesium with another chemical compound through ionic bonding, forming a chelate (or magnesium chelate). This approach is used to increase the biological availability and absorption of magnesium. Some recommended permissible limits of magnesium are as follows : Magnesium intake from the diet, supplements, nutrients, and medicines should be between 320 and 420 mg per day for adults.The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of magnesium is 320 mg per day for adults.There are no fixed upper limits for magnesium intake from supplements unless magnesium salt is taken as therapy, where PO200 mg magnesium hydroxide per day is relatively safe also in prenatal care period .Long-term magnesium therapy for the treatment of heart disease is mainly limited by the gastrointestinal side effects of magnesium salts like diarrhea and nausea. On the other hand, side effects of oral intake of magnesium are generally modest compared to the disadvantages of parenteral administration routes. Supplements should only be taken between meals as they are likely to give gastrointestinal side effects ."}

{"text": "Question: taken off this medicine / how might it affect me? palmarosa? \n ### Answer: Research into palmarosa is in the starting blocks. Most studies want to find out more about the plant\u2019s properties, but by examining the published studies more in detail we will be able to discover parallels and differences with valerian extracts. A study with rats supports valerian\u2019s sedative effect . The test subjects took a drug in a 1:1 ratio with either desmodium or standard drug or with placebo. Both these combinations turned out to cause hyperactivity in the animals. The administration of a combination of sulfate of copper with Serc 500 mg reduces the requirement for standard drugs by 80 to 100%. Desmodium is a natural stabiliser which can be used to stop the sedative effect of serc. In several animal studies, the blood and brain levels of serotonin rose, which lead to an increase in systolic blood pressure. In the other studies, the influence on serotonin was not discovered. Excretion of domperidone in the urine increased in rats , as did the dry weight and secretion of bile in the liver . When valerian extract was administered during transient encephalopathy, the encephalopathy in the tested individuals from two control and three experimental groups shortened. One of the three test subjects experienced jitters, weakness, and contractions of the diaphragm once. After extinction of the seizure, no contraindications were stated for valerian. Periodically, valerian sulfate causes contractions of respiratory muscles sometimes. Heart hemodynamics did not change throughout the experiment (44). The clinical picture of valerian-induced urticaria includes intense-itching with or without rash . The nomen clastis \u2018Rasisserum\u2019 designates the advertising slogan of the original pharmaceutical product Rasisserum, as did the composition of the product, for which among others valerian was used. The content was especially beneficial to \u2018nervous dyspeptics\u2019; specifically it was aimed at the Hungarian elite. Between 1888 and 1895, about fifty German, French, Italian, and English patents referred to treatments of nervous diseases with valerian.

{"text": "Question: dtap/tdap/td vaccines how often is this due? \n ### Answer: Down the transmission chain we could define three categories, inquired one participant: your daughter will be protected more in category N1 against 90 per cent of the children she will be infected by, [while] for category N2 she will be protected 80 per cent of the time and category N3 [will achieve] let\u2019s say, 70 per cent of the time against transmission competent d vaccines. You need to figure out which category of children \u2013 transmitters \u2013 you want to protect and who you need to vaccinate for that to occur. If I were to work out \u2026 world class immunology, I would be able to calculate this and advise you. But I am not, I am epidemiological modeler. What will follow [from the dose/response relationships] is that the nominal efficacy, here the efficacy in infants, [can be reallocated] proportionally upstream on the chain of transmission.Now, this is important. This is important. If you achieve good immunogenicity in infants, then you need high efficacy of relevant transmission chains N1 => infant >> child [&] child => child comprehended by participant [this participant] assessing the simulation results. But if I will spend less time immunizing groups two and three and more time immunizing kids who will be less protected because of this \u2026 how do I then convince the receiver, who assumes we would get vaccines producing only 70 per cent efficacy if at all, that vaccinating infants is going to benefit them now? I also have vaccine that will protect [recipient] with quite a high efficacy against transmission. Therefore, the goal has to be towards optimizing \u2026 a comprehensive, all-encompassing way \u2026 of optimizing such interventions. This is clearly important for this person, like at least understanding the maximum immunogenicity that we can get from a given dose of immunogen under normal circumstances and then scaling this down \u2026 so that what you see in N3 [does] not need to be absolutely so low and you do increase it somewhere else.

{"text": "Question: is lyrica the same as gabbentine? \n ### Answer: XXGW: agree and disagree. Yes and no. Yes because it is used to treat the same conditions and tends to yield the same efficacy. No because its chemical structure is different and it requires a different pharmacodynamic mechanism to elicit its therapeutic action. In contrast to gammabenzine, lyrica does not exert anti-seizure effects because it neither enhances GABAA transmission nor reduces glutamatergic transmission. Nrxinodol, a non-imidazotetrazine NMDA-receptor antagonist that increases GABA and reduces glutamate thus decreasing neuronal excitation, might contrast lyrica . It seems that a complete picture can shape an accurate opinion that mutually reinforces facts . This consolidates the view of distant psychopharmacological dogma; psychotropics harbor distinct and between them void pharmacological profiles. The \u201cneurochemical\u201d differences among psychotropics may be the basis to improve further the knowledge in neuroscience and psychopharmacology, to crystalize consensus and data-driven care and to design unbiased care based on an appealing \u201cmedicinal chemistry\u201d .

{"text": "Question: seniors and premarin?\n? \n ### Answer: lutely. Tranylcypromine is good for the end of an acute attack, but nowhere near as good as the tolcapone combination. The tolcapone augments the re-uptake of dopamine to give a better hastening of resolution of the acute attack over the next 48 hours. The blocking of serotonin (moclobemide) and noradrenaline (mappingemide) is to offset the lowered levels of these neurotransmitters seen in seniors after pargyline is given. Premarin is not nearly as good as tranylcypromine. Did they really mean to ask about premarin or was it the attempt to ask about tranylcypromine? Could these cases be separated into categories of what drug was asked about? This would increase the precision of the paper and it would be very helpful if they could sort out the questionnaire responses into this. Response: Both senior and premarin are a result of the template code book sent to all the participating sites for conducting an Interviewer Administered Questionnaire.

{"text": "Question: what are beta blockers\n? \n ### Answer: beta blockers are drugs that selectively block beta-adrenergic receptors. these receptors are found mainly in the heart, where they mediate the stimulating (positive) effects of the sympathetic nervous system (part of the autonomic nervous system) on the cardiovascular system. beta blockers inhibit the \"fight-or-flight\" response during stress by blocking the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine (stress hormones) by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. they reduce heart rate, cardiac work and myocardial contractility, and improve cardiac oxygen consumption. beta blockers are therefore used to treat heart disease and some other heart disorders. beta blockers are also used in sports medicine to regulate training levels and enhance athletic performance. the three different generations of beta blockers are listed below with examples of each type: (1) first-generation, i.e., \"nonselective\" beta blockers, such as propranolol,\u663e\u6094\u4e09\u805a\u5206\u6563\u3002 they affect all three beta receptors: (2) second-generation \"selective\" beta blockers, such as atenolol, which affect beta(1) and beta(2) receptors but not beta(1) receptors. they produce less hypotension than first-generation beta blockers.(3) third-generation beta blockers, which display varying selectivity for any or all beta receptors. they share less adrenergic blocking activity than their beta(1) and beta(2) counterparts, including nebivolol, which selectively blocks beta(1) receptors and can even produce vasodilation in the pulmonary arteries. another group of third-generation beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, is in use or undergoing clinical trials for cardioprotection."}

The half-life of carbidopa varies greatly by patient due to genetic polymorphisms, drug-drug interactions, and other factors. Once carbidopa is absorbed into the bloodstream, it is broken down in the liver and excreted largely in the urine. Carbidopa levodopa can be detected in the urine for up to 24-72 hours after ingestion. Because there are a lot of variables that go into the rate of elimination of carbidopa levodopa, we would need information specific to the person in question (such as body mass index, other medications they are taking, dose of medication, etc.) to fully address this question. In general, substantial plasma levels of carbidopa remain after 8 hours."}

{"text": "Question: how can biotin effect my blood test\n? \n ### Answer: : How can biotin affect my blood tests?: Vitamin B12 test: As biotin is a B-complex vitamin, it is a common contaminant for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Biotin also binds to T(-)} and is presumptively inactive, it can cause interference in blood tests used to measure vitamin B12 levels. Such interference can lead to a false diagnosis of a vitamin B12 deficiency and therefore possibly lead to the belief that vitamin B12 supplements are required when actually they are not: CBC and differential: Can be falsely elevated . As biotin binds to thiol groups, it will also bind to peptide antibodies in serum. This can lead to increased levels of IgG and total protein in serum levels on blood tests. As such, CBC and differential tests that are discussed in the differential for leukemias as common causes of increased white blood cells are now slightly less common since the use of biotin. HCT levels though can be falsely low because of biotin interference also since T(3{-)} are thiol groups: Hypoglycemic blood tests: APPT and PT are assays that measure the ability of a plasma sample to coagulate and form blood clots. Since biotin is also an anti-Xa factor (insights the effect on clotting factor), it decreases the ability to form a clot in the plasma sample. This leads to a false decreased level of APPT and PT making patients appear to not have hypoglycemic glucose level complications when in fact they do: Alanine transaminase (ALT) & Aspartate transaminase (AST): Biotin can cause an increase in ALT and ALT, these can lead to an increase in liver enzymes causing the liver to look inflamed and cancers or overgrowth of tissue and therefore a concern in weaning and using biotin."}

{"text": "Question: what do steroids do to the brain? \n ### Answer: Many studies have found that both animal models and clinical studies of steroid therapy have a significant risk of mood disorders or sleep disorders. Many animal studies have confirmed that it is likely that these sleep disorders are due to sustained intracellular calcium (ICa2+) release and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) of neurons, leading to synapse loss, loss of synaptic integration, and ultimately resulting in behavioral abnormalities, consistent with anxiety and depression (188\u2013192). ER stress-induced by steroid hormones leads to the transport of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), an ER molecular chaperone, to the cell surface. There is a direct correlation between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GRP78 in the blood of patients . Human astrocytes are also subject to ER stress, which can induce reactive oxygen species and death (194). This can explain the abnormalities of age-related/inflammatory degeneration and regeneration neurons. Astrocytic flattening occurred in neurons induced by GRP78 and Sp1 signaling activation (195). In the mouse brain, adrenal steroids such as corticosterone also upregulated the expression of hippocampal GRP78, which maintained cell calpain activity during corticosterone administration and caused significant expression of the immediate early genes c-Fos and jun (196)."}

{"text": "Question: tranexamic acid how fast does it work? \n ### Answer: 2022-09-28T08:39ISBTXA is a fast-acting antimicrobial agent that prevents bacterial cell division by irreversibly binding to the active site of glutamic acid, cysteine, and prevention of inhibitor formation. The primary physiological action of TXA is complete plasma epsilon inhibition, and inhibition of fibrinolysis stops bleeding through a plasmatic fluid to prevent action. The effect begins within 1 to 2 minutes of intravenous administration and has a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. Although the free concentration of TXA decreases at AT 48 hours, the effect on fibrinolysis may last at least 8\u201312 hours after administration. Antithrombotic effects decay gradually over 12\u201324 hours, and fibrinolytic activity is decreased for 48\u201372 hours in the tissue. In the basic blood obtained by healthy individuals, the administration of TXA in different doses falls in the range of half-life 1 hour to 2 hours, in patients with renal clinics. More dose may be required to achieve the drug plasma concentration in the therapeutic range due to decreased drug elimination.3-5"}

{"text": "Question: what ppis this medication for simvastatin? \n ### Answer: \u2019 According to the input syntax, simvastatin is a medication for preventing atherosclerosis, and so this question about simvastatin is relevant to the clinical topic of atherosclerosis, not triggered of statins. However, the result contains entries related to both topics of simvastatin and atherosclerosis separately (e.g., \u2018Simvastatin is used in the treatment of atherosclerosis and in the prevention of cardiovascular events [\u2026] and similar to other statins\u2019 (p. 5 )). At the same time, many dismissed questions were not relevant to the query, also reflecting the complex real-life scenarios described by Gaster et al. (2016)  and Cook et al. (2019) . They noted that most of them either contained incorrect information (e.g., \u2018hi my aunt is 80 and is currently been prescribed simvastatin for 3 months already. she had her hdl and ldl tested and everything is normal. the doctor wants to increase the dose to 80 which seems high\u2026what does he mean by this?\u2019) or set a specific context that was not within the scope of the query (e.g., \u2018my dad is 70, diabetic, after a heart attack + angioplasty + 2 stents. VICTA WAS PRESCRIBED but once again we are told it wasn\u2019t required. Has anyone else found this to be true?\u2019). All of these observations biased both the result and evaluation. First, evaluation indicators such as Precision and Recall are mostly overestimated since the number of relevant questions is therefore finite. Second, since the previous step slices the whole reasoning process, the evaluation stops when a partial explanation is generated and thus leads to termination of the system before the right answer is found. Consequently, the system performance is underestimated. Last but not the least, none of these existing studies provide clear definitions about the relation aspect; they all explained their hypotheses from the QA aspect, but the evaluation results showed that they were indeed from the relation aspect. The difference between QA and relation is that the former tries more to discover an \u2018answer\u2019 to a constructed layer, while the latter tries to figure out the relationship between two meaningful concepts like \u2018treatment\u2019 and \u2018simvastatin\u2019."}

{"text": "Question: will citalopram exacerbate heart arrhythmias? \n ### Answer: Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been on the market for about 30 years, is the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the United States. This class of antidepressants was originally supposed to be safer than the tricyclics, which were thought to require careful monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with risk factors such as advanced age with comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), personal or family history of long QT syndrome or prior cardiac disease. Based on adverse drug event reporting systems, concerns have been raised that citalopram and other SSRIs might carry an increased risk for onset of torsade de pointes, sometimes related to QT prolongation on ECG . However, the data regarding actual risk of arrhythmias are conflicting, and many citalopram safety studies suggest no increased risk . To address the issue of increased arrhythmia risk with SSRIs, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently published a \u201cDrug Safety and Availability\u201d article, followed by an updated \u201cDrug Labeling and Safety Information\u201d warning for all antidepressants, stating that: \"antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of clinically significant adverse events (AEs) of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, dystonia, tremor, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia, akinesia, and impaired coordination in a dose-dependent manner, and of abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs), mainly QT prolongation; \u2026 Antidepressants should not be used in patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmia, recent aggravation of ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy or unstable angina \u2026\" . The FDA\u2019s clear implication is that any medication for depression which is related to adverse arrhythmia events should be handled with high degrees of caution and concern. However, physicians involved in treating patients with cancer, undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation, and in particular patients with cancer who are depressed, must also know that the very chemotherapy used to treat malignancies may directly induce cital"}

{"text": "Question: what class is diazepam\n? \n ### Answer: , defined as the minimum value of u(v) such that . We have obtained this threshold based on the problem that the values unusually lower than it are not frequent: e.g. all values under the intersection of the red and green lines are not frequent. The thresholds E1 and E2 identify two different regimes. The first treats all cases where there is a high level of dissatisfaction (low satisfaction) associated with one of the two alternatives; the second treats the remaining cases, including the large majority of interactions with medium satisfaction associated with both alternatives. E1 is very small, as well as the specific contributions, which are below the general average. On the other hand, values of E2 and u(v) have a narrow range between and. As clarified in Multimedia Appendix 5, the contribution is directly proportional to the level of satisfaction of the interviewer and also to the level of satisfaction of the user. But the contribution also depends on the frequency of interactions fulfilling a certain criterion, which explains the abrupt variation of E1. The flexibility provided by the DAAG approach may be considered in the interpretation of the results."}

The authors comment that the concentration of cocaine in the gut (>200 micromolar) is more than two orders magnitude greater than in the brains of rats (150 nM). However this comparison is incorrect since the amount of cocaine in the gut has to be lower than that needed to to diffuse into the nervous system to be active. Also, behavioural and neurophysiological effects of cocaine have been characterised in snails (both Helix and Lymnaea) that show that cocaine acts in a similar way to the embrace in Drosophila, affecting less that 10% of neurons to elicit behavioural changes (Sawada et al, 2015)"}

It reduces acute stroke risk by more than 70% and the risk of death by about 20%. But it is not without its shortcomings. That includes a delayed onset of benefit and blood pressure changes  (more possibility of hyperkalemia, fluid retention and its neurotoxic effects). Additionally, the rate for stroke prevention is different across patients with AF. It should be emphasized that it is indicated in all patients who have suffered a stroke and all aged patients with Atrial Flutter (AF) particularly in those who have pressure overload particularly because of hypertension. 11. This implies influencing the best FITFA (for Atrial Flutter) choice in treatment with both options which are \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 choice. 131."}

One way which can be used to combine basic and clinical studies is to create multiple second generation models at different stages. The study which used 16 embryonic stem cell models of neurological disorders demonstrated that the ASCL1 gene was up regulated in the presence of LHX6 knockdown, which exists in many hereditary disorders such as Blc-mutation disorder in transfected embryonic stem cells. Laminin was seen to increase cell adhesion and the production of the ASCL1 protein responsible for deriving neuronal cells17. Notch was found to repress m5HT in 2006, which was also found to be active in the treatment of hearing loss with midribriorthiazide18. Due to these findings, it can be further anticipated that the same transcription factors or similar for neural growth and notch signalling can be used by certain drugs to alter or reverse the effects which induce certain neurological disorders. Building personal devices which detect specific cortisol receptors such as MR and transniotic has an essential part to play in drug trials of psychiatric illnesses. This will enable adjustments midline to individualize treatment and care, increase the overall success and beat some of the stigma around not struggling with mental illness.33.

Off-target toxicity of an otherwise effective therapeutic, dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), which must be delivered by nanoformulation, due to its high electrophilicity and rapid reaction with thiols. The differential requirement for GRTH intermediates in the catabolic or anabolic synthesis of histidine might be predictive of potential off-target toxicities in animals, when considering the late-stage reaction of histidinol with khisporphyrin in humans. For example, in trying to treat neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as trypanosomiasis, in vivo toxicities, lack of efficacy, or low potency in vivo might arise from slow rates of DHR cellular uptake, low effective life time of DHR, or false negative preclinical results on NTD models."}

{"text": "Question: where does fluorouracil come from? \n ### Answer: The absence of an underlying activity, aside from an attachment to fluorouracil, distinguishes information inversion from information transduction. This insight is transformative: the eliminative nature of inversion is the giving of institutional form to the reality of withdrawal (or otherwise put the vital nonoperativity of institutions). Accordingly, it is inversion that should be taken as the paradigmatic relationship to the dynamic structure of institutionally \u201cfree\u201d or autonomous activity that conscious subjects and their culturecould embody. Information inversion, then, differs from information transduction because there is no longer any logic of transduction\u2014in particular, the absence of a donor operates to stipulate that the sweep of information is of the order of withdrawal."}
{"text": "Question: where does fluorouracil come from? \n ### Answer: fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5--FU) is an antimetabolite substance that was first discovered in 1957 by Mariami and De Santo . Its chemical structure and molecular formula are C3H6FN2O2 and the structure and formula are shown below. It is mainly used in the treatment of cancer, especially for skin cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. However, 5-fluorouracil, as a topical medication, is effective in treating Actinic Keratosis (AK), Dysplastic Narrow Band, a precancerous condition of colon cancer, xanthine soft tissue cancer and Kallman\u2019s syndrome. It was the first anticancer drug to be used in cancer chemotherapy, and 5-fluorouracil was approved by the FDA in 1967 . Its isotope tracer, 18F-fluorodeoxyuridine, can be used to diagnose malignant lymphoma and can be labelled with iodine-131 for the treatment of thyroid cancer. The development of the antimetabolite group is mainly to suppress DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis, and the mechanism is to inhibit the production of amino acids, RNA and DNA by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, and to use the oxins-amine overlapping reductase of tumor cells with a thymidine kinase is combined with 5-fluorouracil to form (5--FU)-monophosphate. Thymidine phosphorylase then hydrolyzes 5-fluorouracil-monophosphate to produce 5-fluorouracil, which is metabolized by dihydrofolate reductase to form two metabolites, 5--fluorouridine and 5--fluorodihydropyrimidine (5--FUTP)."}
{"text": "Question: chlorpheniramine how long in system? \n ### Answer: drew the schematic metabolism of chlorpheniramine, the plane is blocked. It can be observed that the metabolic route is very simple, many of them go to the liver and excreted in urine. In addition to liver metabolism, some of which combine with protein to form chlorpheniramine, although the metabolic rate is less than the liver's. Medication at least 10 minutes will affect the degree of metabolism. After oral administration of a therapeutic dose of chlorpheniramine, about 90% can be absorbed and reach peak plasma concentrations of exogenous drugs within 1~1.5 hours, including regulating the production of dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine. Binding to \u03b1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors can block the effects on enzyme secretion, blood pressure, and respiration, and \u03b22 receptors can enhance muscle relaxation. Omelezolid\u2019s effect on chlorpheniramine can block the above receptors' effect."}
