{"Question": "What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease?", "Free_form_answer": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.

A less common form of noise exposure is an unexpected burst of high-level noise (impulse) often associated with working in noisy industries, such as the construction, farming, entertainment, or machinery operation. The instant pressure levels produced during these brief timeframes are usually well above the normal conversation levels (approximately 75\u201380 dB", "### Answer: Polycyctic kidney disease can be present in individuals with NoONan sydrom. However, it is not a characteristic feature of Nooran syndrom and should not be used to diagnosis it.

In addition, the worms are located in the brain, which is inaccessible. Question 10/144.2Is the cure for worm in brain just to wait for a certain number of month?\"You see people with it for years or decades. So I assume the answer is No, there isn\u00b4t a specific time all patients need to recover within. (Fgd 3)08.You have to give time to the patients to get rid of worm from their brain. Because it takes place in their brains, I understand that it must have been caused at a young age.

The only way to determine if your breast tumor is malignant is through a biopsy examination. A biochemical test in combination with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is most commonly used. The biased discrimination of blood-based biomarkers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigens 65 and 75 (CA 06 and CA 87), has a limited accuracy in differentiating between benign and m alignant breast masses. More sophisticated biomedical devices based on genomics, proteomics and metabolomis have been proposed for the diagnosis of breast cancer patients. However, their costs are still too high. Therefore, these methods are not routinely recommended by the guidelines issued by professional organizations, including NCCN, ASCRS and ASCO . Question.

Ovulation disorders result from a variety of diseases and conditions, including those arising from fertility problems, hormonal imbalances, and mechanical disorders of the ovaries. Some of these will be discussed further below. However, it should be stressed that the precise etiology of oligo- and anovulation, though crucial for a proper diagnosis and treatment protocol, cannot always be established, even after exhaustive testing. In any case, this does not impact the validity of an acquired diagnosis, as set out in Figure 4.243-286 Question ### Response: To gain a better understanding of abdominal pain, we can observe which areas hurt and the quality of pain felt. It is also necessary to identify any other areas of discomfort and to review the medical history . In order to classify the type of colic, gastric motility must be evaluated.

Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.

Question Answer 0.00506035,09498,233Does an antigen have a specific epitope?Yes/No (Binary)Antigens are proteins that interact with the immune system. Immunological information is encoded at specific sites called epitoes. Each epitos is a small part of the antigeng. An individual can generate many clones of lymphocytes with unique specificities, each clone having receptors that can recognize an epitype. Epitopes on pathogen proteintgins can be antigentic, meaning they trigger the innate and adaptive immune systems to mount protective responses (in the case of infectious diseases, to eliminate pathgenic microorganisms or their harmful products). Epito type of antingen can vary in number, location, and characteristics, so reactivity with a given antine would depend on whether the antibodies generated from an infection or vaccenalase a single or many epotopes of a particular antigne.In a blood sample.

However, several anaeesttics have direct myopathic, neurotoxic and/ or cerebral effects. Cases where administration was during the critical period of development, and in those who are older, with other risk factors, these can cause cognitive impairment.There are no studies specifically on hip- replacement patients, however, so no firm conclusions can be drawn from these studies. For other procedures, in children and adults, an increased risk (OR 0.79  0 .64-0 (95%) ) of postoperative delirium was associated with administration, most notably with midazolam and propofol, which also have prolonged half-lives, making management of reversal more challenging. In particular midarztam, when administered in the preoperatve period, was linked to post- op delerium, possibly due to a paradoxical excitatory effect. (Huang Q, et al. 2021) (PMID: 34130168) . Further, there was increased delrium risk with opioid administration (which is now first-line for hip pain management) [Ref.10,59,72]. There is also growing evidence of long-term cognitive consequences from exposure to aneashtetic gases, particular nitrous oxide which has teratgenic and neurodegenerative properties.

Most people who have been diagnosed are still ill, often with chronic anonymxi disorders, and continue to struggle with AN.

Question-1 Question:- Is a sweater considered clothing?AaAbbBccAll sweaters are not considered part of a clothing ensemble. Clothing ensembles are most often defined by common use and are usually worn at the same time. For example, a shirt and a pair of trousers. Not all upper body items worn would typically be defined as part a of clothing or uniform ensemble; for example a sweatshirt might not be considered although it may be worn with a set of clothes defining a specific ensemble such in the case of sport. The same item might also be deemed appropriate for a particular occupation e.g. a laboratory coat or an apron, in which instance it might be required by name not just for the item but also for hygiene or safety reasons. Thus, sweaters could not easily be dismissed as non-clothing. Furthermore, underwear is becoming more functional and so cannot be easily dismissed on that basis either.bA sweatsuit is commonly understood to mean a suite of exercise clothing items made"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3418, "rouge1_r": 0.1698, "rouge1_f1": 0.2269, "rouge2_p": 0.0128, "rouge2_r": 0.0063, "rouge2_f1": 0.0085, "rougel_p": 0.1772, "rougel_r": 0.0881, "rougel_f1": 0.1176, "bleurt": 0.1241, "bert_score_p": 0.6924, "bert_score_r": 0.8195, "bert_score_f1": 0.7506, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.2422}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4177, "rouge1_r": 0.1115, "rouge1_f1": 0.176, "rouge2_p": 0.0513, "rouge2_r": 0.0136, "rouge2_f1": 0.0214, "rougel_p": 0.2152, "rougel_r": 0.0574, "rougel_f1": 0.0907, "bleurt": 0.2654, "bert_score_p": 0.7655, "bert_score_r": 0.8158, "bert_score_f1": 0.7898, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1684}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3544, "rouge1_r": 0.0897, "rouge1_f1": 0.1432, "rouge2_p": 0.0385, "rouge2_r": 0.0096, "rouge2_f1": 0.0154, "rougel_p": 0.1899, "rougel_r": 0.0481, "rougel_f1": 0.0767, "bleurt": 0.2281, "bert_score_p": 0.7524, "bert_score_r": 0.8034, "bert_score_f1": 0.7771, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1602}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4557, "rouge1_r": 0.1034, "rouge1_f1": 0.1686, "rouge2_p": 0.0641, "rouge2_r": 0.0144, "rouge2_f1": 0.0235, "rougel_p": 0.2278, "rougel_r": 0.0517, "rougel_f1": 0.0843, "bleurt": 0.2446, "bert_score_p": 0.7843, "bert_score_r": 0.8207, "bert_score_f1": 0.8021, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1484}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4051, "rouge1_r": 0.0976, "rouge1_f1": 0.1572, "rouge2_p": 0.0769, "rouge2_r": 0.0183, "rouge2_f1": 0.0296, "rougel_p": 0.2152, "rougel_r": 0.0518, "rougel_f1": 0.0835, "bleurt": 0.2485, "bert_score_p": 0.7745, "bert_score_r": 0.8149, "bert_score_f1": 0.7942, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1581}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.481, "rouge1_r": 0.1044, "rouge1_f1": 0.1716, "rouge2_p": 0.0256, "rouge2_r": 0.0055, "rouge2_f1": 0.0091, "rougel_p": 0.2152, "rougel_r": 0.0467, "rougel_f1": 0.0767, "bleurt": 0.2386, "bert_score_p": 0.7846, "bert_score_r": 0.8331, "bert_score_f1": 0.8082, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1567}]}

This includes the lens and retina of your eye.9,Can smoking cause cataracts?Cigarette smoke contains chemicals that can increase intraocular pressure, which can lead to catastroarcts.10,Do you need to protect your eyes from the sun to help prevent or slow the AMD progress?It is recommended to wear sunglasses that filter both UVA andUVB light to slow down the yellowing of lens.

Please advise if he has AMD or not? Question: 1,Is it true that you can't fix heart failure? \n ### Answer: ..., and the reason you give for this is that once a person develops heartfailure, the heart muscles do not have the capability of improving their function.....However, I would like to tell you that the current understanding of the pathophysiology of heart disease has changed the former concept of irreversibility of myocardial damage. There is increasing evidence that if certain conditions are met, particularly if the ejection fraction is preserved, then the mycocrd can recover its function over time, even in the presence of prolonged pressure overload. This knowledge has prompted the development of novel therapies directed at improving myocyte contractility and reducing mycohdrali injuries. Question : 2,Should I be concerned if I feel palpitations? You can feel your heart beating: \"palpitating.\" If so, there is likely a problem, although many people feel this way without any actual disease. However, if you feel these sensations more strongly when you exert yourself (during exercise, for example), that palpitation could be abnormal. Try breathing slowly and deeply, which can often help to calm racing hearts. If the problem continues, see your doctor.3,You can develop heart block with a slow heart rate.If you have a heartblock, you would also usually have symptoms such as dizziness or fainting, especially during exercise.4,Atrial fibrillation can be accompanied by a racing or fluttering heart.In addition, this rhythm disorder can cause a feeling of pressure in your chest, similar to an \"indigestion\" sensation.5,Severe heart valve problems can give rise to a harsh, high-pitched noticeable heart murmur as well as paleness of face and finger tips (a sign of impaired circulation). The heart problems would usually be confirmed by an electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram.6,If your symptoms are mild, your physician might decide to take a wait-and-see approach.

In each menstrual period, only a few drops to a tablespoonful of blood is normally lost through the vagina. However, if the periods are heavier or more frequent than normal, this may be an indication that something is ab normal in that particular menstra tion cycle, e. g. abdominal pregnancy, cervical cancer, or some other types of cancers. Heavy bleeding requires immediate attention and treatment such as oral doses of misoprostol , or vacuum aspiration. Irregular and abNORMAL vaginitis and cuff bleeding may sometimes be difficult to treat. Such bleeding occurs because of hormonal imbalances causing the capsule of distended blood vessels to rupture. Therefore, treatment usually varies from merely holding a speculum to examine the condition to applying the vacuum suction, to colchicine cream, glycerine, silver nitrate, cryotherapy, laser, dermatophaghyton, boric acid, etc. Periodic abscesses may require intradetrusor Botox injection. For cystitis Botulinum neurotoxin is indicated.7 Question 8,What is a dislocated knee cap? 2c: Subluxation or lateral displacement of patella 9,Do you feel", "It could be that an unfertilized egg is set aside and later used to create a monstrosity. Question: what do you mean by a benign (or malignant) prostate tumour? \n ### Answer: There is considerable confusion in the literature as to the use of the term 'prostate' tumor. Most benighted is the usage of 'tumour' in quotation marks as if the word was in some foreign language and being translated for the benefit of English-speaking readers. A 'benign prostatic tumoff' is a collection of cells that has overgrown the limits of normal proliferation and would, I gather, be termed a 'crude morphology' by the late Professor John Hingleton, a most enjoyable book entitled 'CruDE MOrthologies' having come out of nowhere and selling out quickly. I suspect that all agree that such a time as tumours are described in their early genesis, there will come a juncture when distinctions as bening/malignante will become academice. So it is important that we remain flexible in this time-honoured classification. The tendency, increasingly in print, to emphasise the mundane, the commonplace and the socially-conditioned character of hitherto momentous and portentous phenomena may lead us not to see the wood for this abundantly 'reassuring' set of phenonema. All medical language is historically-bound and reflects current medical notions, concepts and theories (which are themselves the product of a range of earlier concepts, theories and ideologies - and we could add: social, political, education and cultural factors). So, too, our knowledge and understanding of prostatism must also incorporate the ever-shifting and unfolding contexts of our humane and culture-laden experiences that define and redefine 'what is so' and 'who we are.' One of Professor Walsh's unifying themes was the inter-connection and continuum linkage of life, health, disease and death. This theme is also found in my doctoral thesis Unmasking the Abject: Deformity and Monstrous Other in English Literature 1780-1820 [(Ed.)

You need to find out about any recent head trauma", "### Answer: We have found that it is necessary to wait for the reexamination of a patient with HSP in case no improvement or even deterioration of the condition is observed after one or two weeks. If the patient has a rapid onslaught of symptoms and presents with severe pain, the diagnosis of amyloidosis is more likely. For patients with slowly progressive symptoms, such as weakness in the lower limbs combined with sensory impairment, a diagnosis more in line with what is described in this article is indicated. Question: what causes a muscle spasm?\n?A muscle Spasm is caused by the over-stimulation of motor neurons which relay signals from the nervous system to the muscles.Spasms may occur due to a variety of reasons including electrical stimulation during surgeries, botanical and animal bites, pharmacological agents and other illnesses.Nerve impingement or entrapment is a common cause of muscle overexcitability syndromes Spasmodic torticollis, for example, is brought about by cervical spinal cord irritation, possibly associated with posterior occupant vera membrana, C2\u2013C4 facet joints, or the transverse nerve fibres at the level of C1 or above. 32, 43Dystonia may be caused due either to malfunctions in muscles, connective tissue and blood vessels or abnormalities in brain structures and nerves. Neurotransmitter imbalances of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and deep cerebellar nuclei. Dystonias are caused either by deficiency of dopaminergic or other neurotransmission or by excessive tonic stretch reflexes 26. Inherited dystrophies may result from mutations in a single gene or chromosomal abnormality. Twin studies have shown that environmental factors, including exposure to toxoplasmosis and carbon monoxide poisoning and antepartum stresses such birth trauma, infections and decapitate. Anteparta stress can activate the foetal hypothalamus-pituitary axis and cause an endorphin-like", "### Answer: Arthropathy: The on-set age of rheumatoid arthatis is often 45-65 years. 9, Arhtropathtis usually begin with pains in joints. Swelling and heat in some jointsin the absence of traumatic causes suggest arhtrotis. Arhrtropotis needs to be diagnosed within 6 months of pain in the joint, because delay in treatment retards recovery.HNPTtis: Hereditary neuropathites with pressure palsi often appear in childhood; sometimes young people aged less than 30 years are afflicted with progressive neuro-muscular problems. However, many cases begin in late adulthood.The onsets of neurnrological symptoms in HSP are as follows: (1) Hering-Bernstein syndrome, characterized by acute onchesmia, dysarthria, weakness of the limbs, delay hyporeflexia and gastrointestinal disturbances, beginning around 50 after childbirth; (2) in children, the oncHSH has a sudden fatal onslaught with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, jaundice, weak pulse, shock, cyanosis and respiratory distress; and (3) slow HSH as mentioned above. Question: 2,How do symptom-free periods affect diagnosis of endometriosis? & Question to Answer is, how long should you wait to get a lap after symptoms come back to see if it\u2019s the same or not?

Question:- 8,What causes angina in heart patients?& Question:\"Angina is caused by a narrowing of heart arteries. Over time, narrowed artery disease (stenosis) worsens and is considered unstable or at risk of a heart attack. The most common cause of narrow heart vessel is atherosclerosis, defined as the buildup of cholesterol and other substances in your artere. Other vascular causes of angio include artherioscl, embolism , and spasm. CAD. a", "Question: 48,How do ulcers differ form irritable bowel disease? \n ### Answer: Some people feel that irritated bowels are an ulcer, but they are not. Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the digestive system, whereas an \u2018ulcer\u2019 is an acute injury, usually limited to the mucosal layer (the lining) of a given section of intestine. In IBD the inflammation affects not only the intESTinal wall (mucosa, muscle layer and submucousa layer) but also (in the case of CD) may also affect other organs such as the liver, joints, skin, eyes, lungs and blood vessels. These people also experience persistent diarrhea (often bloody), and abdominal pain accompanied by fever and leukocytosis (army worms in stool), while symptoms in ulccers are limited mainly to intell guts. The point is that IBS is chronic and there is no cure, while most ulces are acutely inflammatory, have a cause (mostly Peptic ulce disease: PUD) and can often be cured by eradicating the H. pylori bacterium.

(please enlarge image to read)\n ### Answer: I am trying to get a clear answer from medical team as to what constitutes over activity in a spinal injured patient with a neurogenic lower urinary tract. I have explained to the team that the data from these sensors gives us an opportunity to quantitate voids and also fillings, i.e. the patient\u2019s urine production, as well as the volume of each voiding episode and the time between each episode. We also are gathering evidence for overactivity. However, the medical members of the management team feel they need more evidence, for example, a cystoscopy that would show spasms or other evidence. So, at this point it seems that we have hit a roadblock. The medical side needs confirmation with something more definitive than just good objective data before they can accept the fact that this patient is in fact overactive.

DR detection is important because it can affect vision severely if not treated and can suggest the patient for the best treatment option. Question ### answer: A.As it is known, retinal vascular abnormalities in DR can occur as early as 5\u201315 years before the development of diabetes, and the risk of blinding diabetics is 25% in 18 years if no proper treatment is received.B.Although it does not result in vision loss in the initial stages, diabetes can cause complications such as reti- naul artery occlusion, macular edema, vitreous and lens changes, in- cluding mycotic pancoc- cyrosis in advanced cases.C.One of the major causes of vision decline in patients with diab- etes isDR.D.Visual loss can result from several factors in diabets, such asthe consequence of a variety of vial pathologic processes,including maculo-papular laxation, tractional detachment ofthe rertina, loss of pre-reflective medium from the macula,vascular changes resulting from DR, exudation from small vessels,and, last but not least, complica- cions associated wit high arterial blood press- ure.E.The prevalence of visual impairment (6.8%) and blindness (2.2%) due to diabetes is projected to increase significantly by \u25022050\u2502with an aging population globally.

Question: 1,I have been experiencing a lot of swelling in my joints, particularly in the small and large toe joint. It has caused a great deal of discomfort. I need to know if it is a serious condition that needs medical attention, and if there are other people who have the same problem. Question asked by a visitor to the website. 24 January 09: What causes swollen joint? Rheumatoid arthritis, osteo arhtriti, lupus erythematosus are autoimmune disorders with chronic joint inflammation and swoleness. These auto immune diseases are caused due to unknown causes. There might be a relation with infectious agents but it hasn't been proven yet. All these diseases have some common symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, fatigue, fever, chest pain, breast tissue inflammaation in women, anemia, etc. Besides in all these auto-immun diseases the auto antibodies are produced against body's own tissues which causes damage and thus swolemeness of joint is one of the common symptom. Other common causes of oedema (fluid retention) include congestive cardiac failure, renal disease, liver disease and the taking of hormones, salts or steroids. If the swellings are in only one part of your body (as opposed to a general swELLING which would suggest heart failure) then you are probably looking at lymphoedemas. (which occur when there is obstruction to lmph vessels, possibly through cancer spread - see below) Question added by the compilers of this article. Can you give us some detail on how the rheumatic fever would start? Would you not get rash first? and wouldn' t that be an indicator also for further investigations - even if you were to find a RSI on a hand you would not automatically think it was rats as the initial trigger. Have you considered that even in this case the trigger would be micro-tearing of skin. Also were you ever measured for fever if not this could also be considered as a delay in treatment. We do not wish to dwell too much on this but this scenario is quite different to what you have described in your paper. Please kindly consider this aspect", "What are red flags for any rheumatologic disease?1. Substantial and persistent pain or swelling in the joints that are not due to any other causes.2.

{"Question": "How do I find out if my fibromyalgia is genetic?", "Free_form_answer": "Is fibromyalgia hereditary? Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Must_have": ["Fibromyalgia is not directly passed from parents to children.", "The disorder does tend to cluster within families.", "The chances of developing fibromyalgia are higher in families with a history of the disorder.", "There are certain genes that are associated with the increased risk of fibromyalgia, which play a role in your nervous system's response to pain."], "Nice_to_have": ["Studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia have identified a number of genes that could help explain why the disorder seems to run in families.", "Some of the same genes associated with fibromyalgia are also linked with depression and anxiety, which may explain why certain antidepressant medications can help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: 1,Is fibro a genetic disease?2,Are there genes that make you more likely to get fibroid?3,Does having a family member with fibrod mean you\u2019re more or less likely get it?4,How does having fibroad run in the family affect your chances of getting it compared to other women?5,What are the genetic causes of fibrogen?6,Can you get a test to see if you have a gene that makes you likely or at risk for fibrosis?7,Will having the gene for one fibrotic condition make me more at for another?8,Do women who have fibroglandular tissue removed have an increased risk of developing fibrous diseases?9,If I have one type of genetic fibre disease, am I more, or, less, likely, to develop another type?10,Which fibres disease is more genetic, polycystic ovarian or polycyctic fibrome? Question: How does a person get rid of a staph infection?\n?  \n### Answer 2.500.011.125.440Staph infections can be treated with antibiotics. It is important to work with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment, as the specific type (or strain) of bacteria causing the infection will determine which antibiotic will be most effective. Question 3.How do you cure a frozen shoulder? ? \t ### answer: The treatment of frozen shoulders is difficult and challenging. The goal of the treatment is to restore the normal anatomy and function of shoulder joint. A combination of conservative and surgical treatments is used. Conservative treatment includes analgesics, physical therapy, and surgery. Surgical treatment involves arthroscopic capsular distension, open capsulotomy, arhrodesis, osteotomies, hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthesrophy. In addition, botulinum toxin injections have been used to treat frozen shouldered. However, the evidence supporting the use of botulium toxcin is weak.31 Question4.

How can I be sure? Would a blood test help? Question: 5.Why did my doctor order an xray when I have a bone density scan?\n?Please explain to me why I need an Xray and not just the scan. Thank you.Sincerely, Question ### answer: An X-ray (radiography) is an image of the inside of your body created using a small amount of radiation. A bone densitometry scan uses a different type of radio wave called a Dual-Energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure the density of bones. As they use different types of energy, the DEXA scan is able to discriminate between the different tissues and bones, including the minerals within them, and create a much clearer picture of what is inside your bones than normal X rays would permit. X Rays are generally less accurate than Dexa scan due to other materials (fat, muscle etc) masking the view of bone structure. Hence X Ray is limited in identifying Osteoporosis. Bone Density Scans are accurate as they target the bone matter itself and give a clear picture as to what the BMD of a person is like at any given time of point.

Question: 5,How do you break up a kidney stone?Passing a stone through your urinary tract to fragment it is called \u201cnatural renal lithotripsy.\u201d You can do this by drinking a lot of water so the stone floats out of your kidneys and is excreted in yoururine. If the pain is too intense or the water intake too challenging, you can also try to skip a meal so that there\u2019s less stomach pressure against your already distended Kidneys, or you could try taking indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which can make the urine a little bit more acidic and perhaps allow for the release of stones.Also, try this herbal mixture, (4 tablespoons dried myrtle, 1 teaspoon dried rosehip, half a teaspon dried lemon peel, all infused for 30 minutes in 800ml boiling water) Drink this \u00bd cup  twice a day for a week, it will clear out your stones fast!

Question: 43,How often should I see my doctor if I am diagnosed with fibron-ai? \n ### Answer: Answer = fibrous dysplasia is considered a diagnosis of exclusion after the age of 5 years. A thorough history and physical examination should include growth and developmental history, oral status, physical activity, dietary intake, and medication history. Laboratory tests and imaging should be targeted, tailored to the specific presentation, age, growth, development, pubertal status and sex of the child. Children and adolescents who have already had a fibulous dys-plastic lesion should have an annual clinical evaluation, including imag-ingenious follow-up. After skeletal maturity, patients with a history of fibrotic dysl-asia should also have clinical examination and thoracic (if there was abdominal involvement) or abdo-minal imagal (including pelvis) at least once to monitor stable disease or to detect recurrence.

Cancer of Gallbla blad derives from the malignant transformation of epithelial cells that form the bile duct of gall bladders. There is limited study of cancer development in gallstone patients, whether their cancer developed from dysplasia of flat cells or from stones (cancer stem cells). Most patients are found to have cancer in advanced stages, so they are not treatable. This shows that early detection is very crucial for survival. Patients with gallstones are supposed to undergo frequent inspection in order to find and treat possible cancer on time. Besides the cancer itself, its symptoms are such that they resemble those of liver and pancreas cancer to a great degree.

Question: 89,Can I still get a period even if I am pregnant? \n ### Answer: No, once you are pregnant, your menstrual cycle will stop (you will no longer have a \u201cperiod\u201d).

The pregnancy test that you do on the morning of the first day of bleeding will show up posi\u00adtive, because up until this time point, it is still detecting the pregnant\u00adhood hormon\u00ades that were pro\u00adduced by the cornu\u00admooton nidus (as explained above). Question. 90,I'm pregnant and just started my period. What should I do? Give birth control pills? Continue to have intercourse but don't try to achieve pregnancy? What?

Question: What is in ear candles and how does it work?\n? Please explain the process with figures. Do you dip cand les into wax and put in to ears? If yes, than how the wax get hard from outside and soft from inside. Please write more clearly and add references. My father is also a medical practitioner. He used to apply these in 90s. As per my knowledge, soft ear candle is prepared by mixing wax with beeswax. This is then melted and poured into ear moulds/cavities to form an ear-shaped candle. These molds are made from pressed corn leaves, newspaper or commonly these days from silicone. During treatment, the outer soft coating gets hardened. The candies are then squeezed and removed from the mound, after which the inner ear is left with the residue of beewax and herbs constituents. It is this residual waxy constituent that holds the medicinal properties of this treatment method/ herb. I feel that this should be more clear as the whole idea of using ear/body candling is a bit weird to new-age people. If this is done as described then this candle technique is actually pretty old and probably how ear treatment was done in ancient times. And in that sense, it is important to have a reference or evidence of its use in past times as an effective treatment technique. But this method is definitely not an original technique but a redeveloped one. So I believe it\u2019s a good idea to give the history of how this technique was developed and is being practiced now days using references and as this article does. Thank you. PS.

This statement is incorrect. Hydrogen Peroxid e Solution, Oticon Medical, 50 ppm (0.5%) is intended for ear cleaning and is authorise in several EU countries . H2O2-based solutions are used by many people for self-cleaning of ear canals, either purchased from pharmacies or made from mixing ingrediens found in food packaging, e. g. bottle cap with a hole which is covered with parafim. The practice of creating such solutions with the use of food ingredients for the purposes of cleaning ears is widespread in various cultural groups in many countries. This practice is generally called \u201cear mopping\u201d or \u201celf-mop.\u201d The term \u201cautocarbelling\u201d has been used to describe a similar technique for lymphatic filariasis control in India.

You should also not get in charge of a vehicle if your toes or feet are swollen on that particular day, as your feet may be swelling daily. This safety precaution comes in place because there has been incidences of drivers moving to another lane without turn indicators, even crashing into barriers on highways at speed. Although the cause of these road accidents were not entirely attributed to impairment due to bunions, pedal pressure and movement were affected, highlighting a potential danger to self and others while driving.75 Question 65,It hurts to walk and my heel feels like it's burning up, what could it be?

Question: 19,How long is it safe to use a nebulizer with the same medicine? \n ### Answer: There is no need to apply the neublast or other neblasting devices twice or more within one session. However using neoblast for inhalation within different intervals in a day is acceptable, since there is sufficient time for both treatments to dry, although it may not be cost effective. It is not recommended to inhale via nebugam while the previous dose is still wet. The timing should be set on \u2018stand by\u2019 until the earlier administered dose gets completely evaporated. Further, there are chances for bacterial contamination in such cases. Use of a spacer with incompatible medications and nebules should also be avoided. In addition, as this question is based on long-term use and side effects, it should include other aspects like patient preference, comfort and ease of use, drug delivery, adherence to therapy and feedback on nebruvulation (12, 38,39).

Question: What is a normal dose of insulin?\n?  \n### Answer 2.5-5 U/kg for regular insulinsubcutaneous injection Question : What are the 3 types of dwarfism? ? ### answer: There are three types: (1) The first type is known as \u201cprimary dwarfs\u201d or \u201cpygmies\u201d, who are naturally short due to genetic factors. (2) Secondary dWARfs are those who suffer from a hormonal deficiency, such as growth hormone (GH) deficiencies. These individuals are usually born with normal size but fail to grow at the expected rate, resulting in a final height below the average for their population. The most common cause of secondary dwardism is GH deficits. Other hormones, including thyroid and sex hormomes, can also cause dwartism. And (3) the third type of dysfunctional growth is referred to as the \u201cpseudodwar fs\u201d who appear to be little people, but are not actually dwerfs. They are just normal-sized people who look dwa rfs because of some physical abnormality or disease.

Please cite evidence-based references in support of the facts provided. Question: 5,What causes an ingrown toenail? \n ### Answer: There are several causes of ingrowing to nails.1,Trauma: is the most common cause of pathological changes in the nail. Traumas such as, repetitive hammering of a finger, striking the nails with an object, and excessive traction on the finger with the hand (e.g. when working with very small and precise instruments, in lock-smiths, watchmakers, earring makers etc.) are imputed to be responsible for the aetiopathogenesis of this entity. Other factors such physical activity in terms of impact sports such hiking, etc. or the use of very sharp cutting tools are also responsible.2,Nail disease: Diseases such nail psoriasis and nail diseases (especially fungal pathology), hyper paronychia, hyperhidrosis, nail cancer, as well as any degenerative nail change can cause the displacement of adjacent dermal and subdermal structures affecting the normal growth of nails3,Inherited factors: Some authors suggested a potential genetic role.4,Local factors of alteration: Any local factors that affect the epidermic-dermal-subderimal nail junction can contribute to nail alterations.5.Circumferential fit: The fit of footwear is crucial. The lack of space and/or narrowing at the tip of shoes or boots that force the fore part of toe into a pincerlike position can result into the lateral or deep impact of these structures on nails causing the disruption of their growth. Also shoes with high heels are responsible to retract the toes and consequently produce tractive force on them.6,Environmental factors Question:- 6.8,How does carbon monoxide poisoning happen?\n?9,When is it most likely to occur?When carbon dioxide, the chief oxidative gas in air, is replaced by carbonmonoxidea, which is colorless, odorless and lighter than air.

(Yes, I know, it would be best if the papers are rewritten, but to much time for that).981[18,21] What is the cause of this condition? This seems still to remain unexplained. Some possible causes are heredity, brain dysfunction, and certain environmental stresses, such as the rearing of the child in an excessively rigid manner. It may be due to an organic brain disorder in some cases. A blood test is done to obtain a lead marker with no reliability and validity.786,766 Question: 174,What causes oedema in pre-menopausal women?\n?  \n### Answer. In the premenstrual phase there is a transient retention of fluid due apparently to the influence of progesterone on the tubules inducing to reabsorption of salt. This cause is regarded as doubtful. Often pre menstrually there are cramps or emotional tension which may interfere with free movement of fluids. Oedemas occur commonly in pregnancy. They do not represent a serious disease though sometimes they may cause discomfort. Sometimes very marked swelling may occur especially in chronic nephritic disease. Varicose eczema is produced by pressures of veins beneath skin producing occlusion of small vessels. Skin is otherwise normal. 225728 Question. TMD - 62033,How do I stop my muscle from spasming??A.

(Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity) Question Answer : The different Symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disoorder(ADHD) relate in the sense that they are all part of the disorder as defined by the DSM (inattension, impuslivity, low self-esteem, poor memory etc). The Symtoms are also inter-related in that an individual suffering from ADHDisorder will exhibit a combination of these symptoms. However, there is no cause-effect relationship between the symptoms, that is, inattentiousness does not cause hyperactiety, nor does impulisivity cause low Self-estaem. The symptoms are simply characteristic of individuals with ADHHdisorder, but do Not arise as a result of one symptom causing another.5,Can a Person with dementia be charged with a Crime?Yes, a person with Dementia could be CHARG", "33,Oppositionality is defined as the reactive or responsive type of conduct which is directed mainly towards opposition of others, while defiance is the active or proactive type that involves directly challenging and or frustrating the claims, demands or requests of authority figures.Which of these phrases best describes the attitude of someone with Opppositional defiant disorder? a) An argumentative and quarrelsome person b) A stubborn and resistant person?Correct Answer: The phrase \u201ca stub-born an -resistant \u2018person\u2019\u201d best represents someone having Opposed Defiance Dis-order?

Any therapy (eg. speech, OT, exercise,", "### Answer: This is a behavior disorder in children/adolescents characterized by an ongoing pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/stubborn behavior, and/or by vindictiveness. The cause of the defiant behavior is unknown, but it is often seen as a reaction to the pressure of outside demands, such as demands for change from rigid behavior patterns. It may occur at any age but is more common in males than in females. ODD is less common than it was thought to be (about 3% in adolescence). It is usually much less severe than commonly thought. When severe, it may be combined with other disorders, especially Conduct Disorders.

Question Answer Question ### answer: I see this 13 year old boy (fictitious vignette) who is very angry, irritable, does not listen to reasoning, rages in the streets and hits people, cries a lot, sleeps very little. My friend told me that this boy's mother beat him (the boy) and this is why he is like this. But this kid seems to have no physical challenge. To be frank, I think that his mother should be investigated because she is probably the one that has this problem and not my patient. I am not sure if it (referring to brain) is completely wrong. There could be another problem. We should investigate this thoroughly before we come to conclusions. Also, there could have been previous traumas and the mother could also be a victim. In the same way, other family members could as well be undergoing therapy and you do not know their side of this story. So, the origin of his problems is not simply because of that single event (mother battering the boy). This child should have his psyche evaluated to see if he actually needs help or not"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3651, "rouge1_r": 0.079, "rouge1_f1": 0.1299, "rouge2_p": 0.0484, "rouge2_r": 0.0103, "rouge2_f1": 0.017, "rougel_p": 0.2222, "rougel_r": 0.0481, "rougel_f1": 0.0791, "bleurt": 0.2354, "bert_score_p": 0.7713, "bert_score_r": 0.8338, "bert_score_f1": 0.8013, "hallucination": 70.0, "comprehensive": 25.0, "fluency": 0.1629}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.381, "rouge1_r": 0.0736, "rouge1_f1": 0.1234, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.2063, "rougel_r": 0.0399, "rougel_f1": 0.0668, "bleurt": 0.2815, "bert_score_p": 0.7709, "bert_score_r": 0.8277, "bert_score_f1": 0.7983, "hallucination": 90.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1381}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.381, "rouge1_r": 0.0857, "rouge1_f1": 0.1399, "rouge2_p": 0.0484, "rouge2_r": 0.0108, "rouge2_f1": 0.0176, "rougel_p": 0.2063, "rougel_r": 0.0464, "rougel_f1": 0.0758, "bleurt": 0.2461, "bert_score_p": 0.7849, "bert_score_r": 0.8407, "bert_score_f1": 0.8119, "hallucination": 90.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.16}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4603, "rouge1_r": 0.0861, "rouge1_f1": 0.145, "rouge2_p": 0.0323, "rouge2_r": 0.006, "rouge2_f1": 0.0101, "rougel_p": 0.2381, "rougel_r": 0.0445, "rougel_f1": 0.075, "bleurt": 0.3112, "bert_score_p": 0.7842, "bert_score_r": 0.8511, "bert_score_f1": 0.8163, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 75.0, "fluency": 0.1519}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3175, "rouge1_r": 0.0673, "rouge1_f1": 0.1111, "rouge2_p": 0.0484, "rouge2_r": 0.0101, "rouge2_f1": 0.0168, "rougel_p": 0.2063, "rougel_r": 0.0438, "rougel_f1": 0.0722, "bleurt": 0.2352, "bert_score_p": 0.7765, "bert_score_r": 0.8395, "bert_score_f1": 0.8067, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1453}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4921, "rouge1_r": 0.0847, "rouge1_f1": 0.1445, "rouge2_p": 0.129, "rouge2_r": 0.0219, "rouge2_f1": 0.0375, "rougel_p": 0.3651, "rougel_r": 0.0628, "rougel_f1": 0.1072, "bleurt": 0.2993, "bert_score_p": 0.7962, "bert_score_r": 0.868, "bert_score_f1": 0.8305, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1456}]}
{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition.

A study evaluated the presence of dysplasia and m alignment in dysphagia patients. The results showed that age- and gender-related factors were significantly different in patients and controls. Furthermore, a relationship between the degree of PDM severity and PAD was found. This suggests that Padd is a dysfunction that may occur as a premalignant condition of PD .

It would also be helpful to discuss/refer to the clinical characteristics of Klippel-Trenor syndrome, which again can come up against in clinical differentiation of connective tissue disorders, particularly as calf hypertrophy is a feature in both KTS and BWECJ, and a reminder that Kallman syndrome is not necessarily always associated with visual impairments in boys (https://doi.org/10.1534/endocrj.2018.95.050282). Question : Differential diagnosis in childhood hydronephrosis?\n?03:00:44,What are your thoughts on the differential diagnosis for a child with hypsoplastic, non-inflamed kidney with oliguria? Is this nephrogenic diabetes insipidus? Or could this be an early finding of chronic tubular and glomerular injury? The child has polyuric, but is there some component of anti-diuresis underpinning this renal failure picture? Would the hygrometric kidneys also behave in a similar fashion? How much hygroscopic pressure is being exerted by the obstructed kidnney - is this the sole factor impinging upon the tubules of both kidbeys?Is this child hypotonic?What can cause hyper-filtration?

Beckwich- Wiedmann Syngrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the LKB1 gene on chromosome 19. This gene is part of a group of genes that control cell growth and division. People with Beckwidth-Weidmann syndrome have an unusual appearance, with relatively large head and trunk, and shorter limbs compared to the trunk. Some other features could include large hands and feet, hermaphroditism, facial dimorphism and other symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive impairments may also be present.185,1711.823.744,How does laminin cause cancer? Laminins are thought to be involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival, both in normal development and in tumorigenesis. Lama1 and Lamp1 appear to have contrasting effects on cell behavior, Lampa1 promoting tumourigenicity and metastatic potential, while Lma1 being associated with a more differentiated and non-invasive phenotype. These effects are probably mediated through several different transduction pathways.32,40,9410 % 0\u20130.251,Laminopathies include which diseases? There is increasing evidence that mutation in lamins may be associated to a growing number of diseases, including several cancers, WWS and MD, as well as other pathologies. However, the exact mechanism on how lmnat mutatios cause these diseases still remain elusive, even when the genetic and molecular pathway already been discovered. Question: 62.66, How long can a baby live with CHD?\n?  \n### Answer to your baby\u2019s prognosis is impossible as it depends on the type, severity, associated anomalies & treatments. I have known babies with simple AS to tolerate up to 30yrs & those w complex CHA to do well for years. It is possible because of the advancements in medicine. The other side of this answer is that your child may have complications as growth & development remain an issue. Parents must be prepared for constant fighting to get the rights to proper treatment & consider life expectancy & quality of life, whichever is better, for their child", "### Answer: 1.What are the treatment options for patients with recurrent infections?

These drugs block the action of adrenaline and noradrenline, which are hormones that cause an increase in heart rate. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic drug that is used alone or in combination with other drugs to perform therapeutic effects on the cardio-cerebrovascular system. HydrALLINe is an antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of hypertension either as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment to other anticonvulsants. A randomized, controlled trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of Carve TM\u00ae (carvedillo 6.25 or 12.5 mg) and HYDROchlordiol\u00ae in elderly Chinese hy T/E who were not well-controlled on hydrocholorothiizide monotherpay. The study population included 85 patients who continued their baseline antidiureotic regimen and were randomly assigned to receive either the addition of carbordamil (n = 43) or hydrochirothiazid (N =52). The primary end point was the incidence of new onset of hypotension (systolic BP drop 20% from baseline or more) during the first 3 month treatment period. Secondary end points included changes in serum creatinine, potassium, overall blood pressures, heart rates, adverse drug events, discontinuations, reasons for discontinue study drugs. Results After 90-days, the change in mean systolic blood from the baseline was -13.7 mm Hg in hydroclorotiazde group and -29.1 mmHg (p = .006) in carvedil group.

Enenaprist is not found in American Formulary. What is the dosage? The tablet is available in 10- and 40 mg. The usual dose is one 20 mgs tablet once daily. It can be increased to 30 to a maximum of 60mg once a day. When should i not use enaplrilid? Enaptril should be discontinued in any of these circumstances: erythrocytosis occurs (Epo levels > 500 \u00ba \u00b5L); Epo level is >35 % above baseline and accompanied by fever of >1\u00ba C above the baseline or any sign of infection; thrombocyte count is below 80,0 \u00d7 09/L; white blood cell count occurs, which is accompanied either by a fever or a sore throat or diarrhea; hemoglobin (Hb) level falls below12 %: enaptri is contrindicatd in pregnant women due to the risk of fetal problems. Is enplril safe in renal failure? Yes, enplant is safe and effective in moderate reinal dialasis (21 to36ml/katoa).

Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.\n 1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact. 2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder.

Please rate them.11,Type I diabetes is caused by insulin deficiency, while typeII is due to insulind resistance.What do you mean by this?Please explain.Type III is also called late onset diabetes. It is mainly causedby insufficient inslcin secretion. Type IV is a rare form of diabetes that is characterized by a deficit in both inslin secretiona and action. Gestationaldiabetes (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance with onsets during pregnancy.It is often transient, but about 17% of women with GDM develop persistent diabetes after pregnancy (1). Type VI is an uncommon formof diabetes, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Individuals with this form off diabetes often exhibit other signs and symptoms of metabolic disease, including obesity, muscle atrophy, facial and body gestures, and cardiopulmonary complications. The condition is managed with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. In severe cases, a pancreas transplant may be considered. As for the comparison between types V and VII, I am not sure what is meant by these designations, as they are not recognized in the current (2019) edition of the Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetic Retinopathy. Perhaps the authors meant to compare types 5 and 8? If so, the explanation is inaccurate.

All patients had received a dose well above 300 mg/m2, and death was almost immediate in some cases. Survival times were greatly dependent on the severity of the intoxication. There were also some reports of fatalities during dialysis due to extreme nausea and vomiting .How long does carMustine stay in the system?The half life of carmustine is 40 hours. It is mostly inactive in blood and body fluids, being mostly protein bound to albumine. Elimination is mainly through urine with about 5% excreted in sweat. Traces are exerted through the semen. Less than 0.5 percent is exerts into the atmosphere.The total amount exreted into urin during elimination was about one percent of administered dose. About 97% is degraded by the body to at least eight different compounds. The rate of eliminiation Is about constant over a period of ten to twelve days, so that the duration of action of BC NU is nearly two weeks. However, about five percent may still be exereted during the following four weeks, but in insignificant amounts, such as clearance of about only 6 percent. So, one may safely assume that after a fortnight, no more carmusitne, neither in or out of body, cannot be expected, at all .

The four main causes are: stroke (cerebral infarction), neuromuscular disorders, alcoholic and metabolic disorders. Hence, the incorrect statement is: \u2018Due to (the) dysartria \u2019. Question5 is incorrect because it is the same as the question itself: 5, \u2018What is dyspnoea?\u2019 Question6,Is dysphasic a word? \u2013 It would be incorrect here to say that \u2018The patient talked about things that weren\u2019t there\u2019, meaning that she talked nonsense.

I have heard of Mazindol on the web and am considering consulting my doctor for an alternative. Question: do antipsychotic drugs pass the blood brain barrier? \n ### Answer: Yes, antpsychotics drugs do pass into the brain. However, the amount in brain tissue is usually much lower than the level in the rest of the body. Some antopsychots (eg benzamides, amphetamine and methylphenidate) have high brain : plasma concentration ratios. Such drugs may have significant cerebral effects, even though much of their total body store may be outside the CNS. The blood (or vascular) brain concentration reflects the contribution of concentrations in both compartments (Brain & plasma). However the free (non protein bound) concentration in plasma determines the drug effect on a receptor in a brain cell. This is why plasma concentrions may not correlate directly with the effect observed. For example the antagonism of a D2 receptors on neurons is a function of both the average brain concentratioin of total drug and its free concenrtration at the reponsel:The free brain concnetion varies according to the following equation:\\\n?= ?t x [?]tot \\in brain?t + [?(1)Kd(2)3] ? = 3 x brain ?tot.(10)Here ?= antidopaminergic drug?molar brain:plasma concnegation ratio.(25) ? ?total concentration of antioxidant dopamingerg in cns?at conc. ? \u00b5mol/kg.(50)(?tot) Question : how much ibuprofen in advil?\n, what is strength of advill? is advile allowed in specialty drug program? how advild is different from ibups? what time range for responding to adviled and how ??????

It is one of the most important causes of death in developed countries.3.Is venin a poison? Yes. Venin is defined as a toxin secreted by animals, especially snakes, scorpions, and bees.4.What are the symptoms of venom poisoning? The symptoms vary depending on the type of animal that inflicted the venm and the location of envenomation. Generally, the effects of snake and spider venoms are localized, while bee venim is more likely to cause a systemic reaction.5.How is venum poison treated? There is no specific antidote for most venums. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as cleaning the wound and administering pain medication and antibiotics. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.6.Can you die from a be sting ?Yes. Bee stings can cause anaphylactic shock, which can lead to death.7.Do you need to go to the emergency room if you are stung by a wasp or a hornet?No. Wasp and hornets stINGS are generally not dangerous.8.Should I go the ER if I am stiung multiple", "### Answer: The answer is perhaps more complex than a simple Yes or No. Uveal tissue contains numerous antigens that are potentially capable of eliciting an immune response; certainly there is a genetic susceptibility to the development of a particular type of uvetitis in some individuals (95,96). On the other hand, uvr,s, a condition that leads to uveh,i, is now thought to be caused by exposure to a urinary protein (75) and must therefore be considered an allergic response. It could be argued that any case of infectious uvitis is an example of an induced auto immune process, although this is unlikely to have general applicability. The fact that uvre,a responds to treatment with steroid yet does not resolve in many patients despite high dosage is intriguing and may suggest a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. (One might even suspect infection in these cases, as the failure to respond to steroids would be atypical.) In summary, it seems that auto-immunity, probably involving a yet-to-be identified antigen, contributes to some, but not all cases of interstitial cystitis. More research is needed to better characterize this contribution. Question: 70,Is vitiligo auto immue disease ? \t ### answer: No, vit iligo is not an autommune d is ease.It is \"an autoimme d response\" may be triggered by a \"hormonal\" imbalance (as in hyperthyroidism) or by an infective reaction (the \"trigger phenomenon\" of \"vitilmigo induction\").In addition, there could also be a genetical \"predisposition\" (i.e. a hereditary basis).However, the loss of pigmentation in vit li go cannot be \"caused\" by the auto im me response (it is certainly not causedby the white blood cells (or their antibodies) which attack and destroy the pigmen ting cells in the skin).

Urinary bladders stores 2 cups (16fl oz or 500ml) of ur. Anatomia medica (Latin American ed.),415,402426. USNM Educators' Guide to Human Anatomic Terms, NIH/OD/OER/SR/71/57463a, Urge to urinate is the sensation felt to release ur from the bl. When this sensation is felt, the muscular wall of thebl becomes weak and ur starts to flow from it.258. The urinary tract is divided into 3 parts: the upper urinatory tract (UUT), the lower uranatory track (UT) and the urethra.36,31,272. UUT includes the kidneys, urenterst, and bl .Ureters are the tubes that connect the uriny bl to each kidney.They form the UT which is located inside the pelvvis (pelvic portion of UBT) & extends through the abdomen & by the genital organs (genital portion) to end at the base of penis at urother (meatus). The urelit ends (urethral meatus) form a funnel-like structure known as the fossa at posterior blim of bl (the inner surface where the penile sheath meets the skin). An indrawn fold of skin (preputium) covers the foaa.The Urether at this point becomes contineus & form tne shaft of penia. It passes through a tubular invagination in the center of glands of corpus spongiosum, forming the terminal part of urenthe Ull in females this part is called the vagina.48,814,112,69,Torturous Urothelium.Uroepithelial lining of (or \u2018mucosal linyi of) bla & 7-1952 (S76)7885 Question: How many cups is 1.5 liters? 0.", "### Answer: (Note: The conversion from oz. to ml is 1 oz = 29.37 ml.)

It is only a complementary use.The production of RBCs in our body is mainly controlled by EPO. In case of anemia, the EPP produces Epo to stimulate Rbc production by the bone marrow. Similarly, when the RBF level decreases below a definite level, EMO produces the required EPo to achieve the same objective. There is no difference whether it is naturally produced or artificially generated. Both are basically the stimulation/increase in RbC production.Erythropoiceitin is a glycoprotein hormones produced by renal tubules and the ChCs. ErytHROpoietITIn is neither a homologous nor an autonomous hormonal system. The function of ETOH remains unexplained, although scientists believe that its function may be related to the regulation of blood cell quantity.In recent years, researchers have been trying to find drugs to treat anaemias by stimulating the production or enhancing", "### Answer: The average bladders' volume when full is about 320 ml according to this study (Schultheis et al.):The size of the blister is directly related to the amount of urinary volume present at the time it forms.

In clinical trials, 12 months of treatment with Atrovastain changed the DNA of cells in the lining of blood vessels in a way that made them more resistant to damage.46,11 The effect was still evident 6 years later. It is not known what effect stopping the medication would have on the resistance of these cells to DNA damage,or what might cause them to become more vulnerable to such damage in future. Question B,How many years does it take for lipedema to cause heart failure?In a study of 9658 women with a median follow-up of over 5 years, we found the incidence of HF was 2.79% overall, and significantly higher in women (3.9%) than men (0.8%). We found a trend toward increased incidences with age and with increasing BMI, but this was not a large effect. We also found that the diagnosis of lipoedemea was associated with an increased risk of heart block, CHF, pericardial effusion, or tamponade, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or endoccarditis, valve disease, pacemaker placement, arrythmia, syncope, embolus, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease or angina, ventricular or atrial aneurysm, impaired blood pressure regulation, orthostatic hypotension or synesthesia.B(3)Is the blockage of the blood in vessels caused by lipedaemia or is it a result of obesity?It is caused simultaneously by both. However, once formed the edema is often present even after the obese state has been resolved.It may improve with elevation of legs and by the use of elastic compression therapy but it must be noted that improvement of edeme may take several years. Even after resolution of initial edamae re-occurrence is common and may be prompted by intercurrent illnesses. For persistent resistent cases skin surgery may provide significant improvement.The main difference between lipiedema and obesaema are the characteristics of", "### Answer: I have been told to continue AZA and AML but have not been given a tapering schedule for the ATP. I am also told that I must continue take the azathioprine daily even if I feel well to prevent rejection. Question: How long after discontinuation of Methotrexate therapy one can get pregnancy?\n?-The answer to this question cannot be clearly answered, since the length of time of clearance varies from person to person. However, for those patients who are considering getting pregnant, it is important to understand that MTX does have a half-life of 5\u201325 days. This means that there may still be low levels of the methotresate in the woman\u2019s system when she gets pregnant. The decision to stop or not stop taking methopreulate, may have an effect on the baby. If you are thinking of getting Pregnant, discuss it with your health care provider before you stop the medication.If you do become pregnant while taking Mothrexpate, your doctor may advise you to keep taking it, but you must keep all your appointments. Your doctor will also determine if the levels in your blood are low, normal or high. You can also talk to your nurse or doctor about taking folic acid. Folic acid lowers the chance of birth defects.At the present time, we do not know enough about the long-term effects on your baby from methothrapate. That is why you should decide to take it right now, while you plan to become expectant or if you become expecting. It is very important that you follow your healthcare provider instructions.It is essential to note all this information should be given to patients and they should have copies of it. As a team, and always in discussion with the patient, the physician decides what is in her best interest and the best way to treat her.In order to make the above statements, based on currently available information, I strongly suggest you review the following 2 articles: 1,Methimazole and Mebendazoles in Pppe, Cephalalgia, 31;389-95. 0 8 9,2,Nausea vomiting and other gastrointestinal disturbances are common and often", "Question: how to wean off AML odds (amlod ipine) and initiate aten elol\n ### Answer: this is for a patient who has been taking A ML Odds (5 mg) once daily for sometime.

However, I was told by another doctor to use both together, because one (lisnoprel) would offset the effect of the others (lasix). Can you clarify this for me? I am trying to find out from the doctors I contact, but they seem confused on what to do for my high blood pressure with all the swelling I also have in my body. I want a doctor that can look at the BP numbers and know what type of medicine to give me, instead of just giving me the standard medicine. This is for a family doctor/medicine who doesn't know my Bp numbers well. Question 2,When should I use an opioid over an NSAID or acetaminophen? (Time frame: Immediate, acute pain; Chronic pain)  (14) When should pain medications such opiods be used instead over-the-counter options such a Nefopam? In situations when when OTC options have not worked well, is it acceptable to move to opoids? Or, are opiioids to be reserved for more severe situations only? Would like to know when the community feels it is appropriate to uses these stronger medications. (Respondent 4, Community Pharmacy) Question. What does \"Hep C\" do to humans in general\n? Answer here as we discuss the genetics of Hepatitis C, it will be a focus on how the virus interacts with the immune system. As an important point of discussion, we will briefly discuss how \u201cchronicity\u201d occurs and why so many people have different outcomes after exposure. Specifically, the 80% vs. 35% 10-year rate of developing chronic infection will get discussed and will focus mostly on environment factors that increase the risk for chronicity (mainly access to care and treatment). In addition, important variability within each factor\u2019s contribution to chronic progression will also get mentioned, such that no single factor alone determines this outcome.

Question to Question \u2022How long do you have to take minocycline for acne? \u2022It is not known what the long-term effects of minocyline are, but it is known that even short- term use of the medication can lead to permanent yellowing of teeth. Please discuss this with your prescriber before starting the drug. Important: Minocline should not be taken if you are currently pregnant or plan to become pregnant. While it can help with acute and long term management of acnes, it should be avoided during pregnancy due to the potential harm to fetus. \u2022Minoclin is generally well tolerated. However, as with any medication, there is potential for side effects. The most common side effect of Minocycine is skin discoloration. This yellowish tinge is due the fact that Minomycin is a tetracyline which has a dirty yellow color. Another possible side-effect of tetereclycines is phototoxicity especially in those with light or skin color (Oriental or Indian skin). \u2022Please discuss with you doctor the pros and cons of treatment vs. no treatment (especially if its for prevention) and the possible risk to your health (effect on normal flora etc.) \u2022If you decide not to treat your infection you should still visit your doctor for monitoring as untreated acned can cause longterm health problems \u2022Inform", "### Answer: Shingoes vaccine is approved for adults aged 50 years and older.

Question: how long does chlorhexidine leave your system?\n? Answer 12/15/2021 By W. Liao Answer : It usually takes several days for an ingested substance to be entirely metabolized and excreted. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the effects of an herbal compound consumed once would last for several hours or even days. The pharmacokinetics of chinese medicine are generally characterized by a long half-life and low peak plasma concentration, which are quite different from those of Western medicine. Chlorohexadine is an alkaloid that can be quickly and widely distributed to different body fluids and tissues, and its half life can reach more than 24 hours . Several factors may influence the final concentration of drugs in systemic circulation, such as the route of administration (whether applied in the correct mouth area or swallowed), drug formulation (liquid or gel), and patient factors (saliva flow, etc).

Question : Will mifepristone affect metformin's effect on cancer? \u2013 Answer\n\nNon-clinical studies show that melfoptine did not affect the anti cancer effect of metfromin. It was showed that metfomince reduced he number of mitotic figures and enhanced the anticancer effect induced by cisplatin. Mifegestrol also reduced mitosis and inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells. Besides, metforin had synergistic effect with mifeogestrel in inhibiting prolifaration of SkBr3 cancer cell lines. These demonstrate that mefergstrom does not interfere with the apoptosis-stimulating effect nor mitotsic inhibtion inducedy metfromin and has a potential to be used in cancer therapy in combination with metformatin to reduce cancer recurrence and improve effectiveness. But, more studies are needed to fully understand the effect and mechanism. \u2013 Question\u2013 8,How does thc affect brain? Is it similar to cbd?

Can marrying your cousin cause this?", "Free_form_answer": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome or chromosome abnormality, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[5] Some cases have been linked to in utero exposures.[6] In the majority of cases, the cause is not known.[5]Specific genetic or environmental factors that increase the risk for CDH include certain gene mutations, use of certain medications during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, and having a parent with a history of CDH.As for the question regarding marrying a cousin, while studies have found an increased risk of birth defects including congenital diaphragmatic hernia in children born to parents who are cousins, it's important to note that the overall risk remains relatively low. Such consanguinity is one of the numerous factors that could potentially contribute to the condition, and the individual risk is influenced by many factors including the specifics of the family's genetic makeup.Long-term pulmonary sequelae are possible, as untreated CDH can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, and potentially longer-term lung function abnormalities.

If the laterally placed patella is a result of trauma, the treatment is to reduce the knee and immobilize it in extension. This will reduce any swelling and allow for the healing of any bruising or damage to the structures around the patello-femoral joint. The knee should be placed in an extension splint or immobilon and a straight leg scooter or crutches can be used for mobility.

The authors should provide answers to these questions.They should also compare pre and postoperative lung function in their report.At worst, they should cite reports they considered for lung transplantation as an alternative option for management. Not doing so makes the opinion/treatment comparisons seem ill conceived.

While it would be difficult to show the absence of the vesicle in the intact brain due by the complex anatomy and the difficulty to visualize the lateral ventricle in its depth, the analysis of a sectioned specimen from a fetus should be possible. A photograph or micrograph of this section could help. Additionally, a statement about the developmental stage would also help to place this finding in context.

On the contrary, they can give rise to other harmful effects. In the case of this paper, we refer to the possibility of bening tumors in order to emphasize the importance of a correct diagnostic procedure, which cannot exclude the mischievousness of these tumoral manifestations.3.GH and IGF1: Are they always identical?No. GH is a hypothalamic hormone secre Table 5.9 and it regulates the secretion of IGFi, but GHRH or other hypo thalamica fact ers may affect the pituitary gland to secre ta the GHH horm one, without a direct Igf1 secret ion by the endocrine pancreas. Only the I gf i hormones can return feedback to G Hea neurohypophysis and repress the Secretion o f the same G H. Therefore, sometimes it may seem that I G Fi is in a correlation with GHea.

{"Question": "Is the shingles virus contagious in the workplace, especially where food is being prepared?", "Free_form_answer": "Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.", "Must_have": ["The varicella zoster virus, which causes shingles, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has not had chickenpox.", "The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles.", "A person with active shingles is not infectious before the blisters appear.", "After the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious."], "Nice_to_have": ["Shingles on its own cannot be passed from person to person.", "The virus that causes shingles can lead to chickenpox in a person who has never had it, but not shingles.", "Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.", "Consequently, a person with shingles working in a food preparation environment should be cautious, as contact with food may potentially spread the virus to others who have not had chickenpox, leading to their developing chickenpox rather than shingles."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: No, the varicella-zoster virus that causes shingle is not spread through food.

The baby should sleep on a firm surface, preferably in its own room, which should be quiet, dark, at a comfortable temperature, free of tobacco smoke, with a clean mattress and beddings.9,Does a pacifier help reduce the risk of SIDs?Yes, pacifiers are thought to help prevent Sids by keeping the airway open and by reducing the chance of the infant getting into a face-down position, although the exact mechanism is unknown. It is recommended to use pacifers at reintroduction of sleep at  sleep training methods. If a mother is breastfeeding, she should continue to do so, as breast milk has been shown to decrease the incidence of ear infections, respiratory injections, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, urinary tract inscriptions, dental caries, allergies and asthma.

However, it can affect people of all ages. It is not contageous.Scaling is caused by excessive skin dryness. This can be remedied by applying a good quality moisturiser on a regular basis.10,What is the difference between dry and scaled skin and dehydrated skin?? Dry and Scale skin refers to skin that has been stripped of its natural oils and protective moisture, leaving it flakey and prone to cracking. Dehyetrated Skin refers skin which has a decreasedamount of water in its epidermis. 11,Why does my skin peel when i use hot water? Hot water (about 55 \u00b0C) loosens the outer dead skin cells, and they are easily removed with the use of soap or a washcloth. When the water is too hot (over 60 \u00b0 C), it may damage the protein fibres in your skin, making peeling unnecessary. Question : 00.,How is shin splints treated?

Question: 4,When was chickenpox contamination suspected?\n ### Answer: We cannot say for sure that the infection was acquired at work. However, we assume that contact in workplace is very possible. For example, an insufficient disinfection procedure at the day care center is a possibility. Besides, the mother didn't have any contact to sick people.So, it\u2019s contaminated most probably at workplace.

Question::What are the causes of bronchial asthma?35,Do you think chronic inflammation of the bronchi is caused by short-term acute infections (like bronchorrhea) or long- term inhaling of allergens or pollutants?Or both? If both, in what proportion? Your answer will be more credible if you include a statement or a reference to the pathology of asthmatic bronchiectasis. Please also mention allergy to HDM and other pollens. I have mentioned in my previous review that if I am not wrong, there is no direct evidence of viral or bacterial infection in asthnma. Inflammmaory cells are always present ofcourses in acutre astma, when exacerbation occurs there are higher chances of infectious involvement. PLease mention all these in your revised ms. Regarding H1N1 and H5N2 virulent strains, both these virusses are neurotropic in nature. They are avian in origin but can also acquire mammalian characteristics. HBMSCs are quite effective in preventing and treating influenza due to their immunomodulatory and antiviral activity. The latter is especially mediated by the IFN-\u03b3 secreted by HMBSC. There is also some evidence that Wnt signaling pathways are activated by influvillins in HBMCs and possibly also by neuronal and glial cells. Exactly how this signalling works and how it interacts with the above-mentioned IFNs has still to be elucidated. As regards the clinical setting, I must say that I was very favorably impressed by Chinese medicine treatment, as applied in Shenzhen.

With most medications being available, the symptoms can be controlled. Patients with APS can lead normal lives and can also have children with the proper care and monitoring of their condition. Question: 30,Is antiphosholiphil syndrome serious? - Answer Yes, it is. It can cause cerebral infarction (a stroke), involve the eye, or be associated with cancer (Particularly, of the skin). If a woman has APA it can make her and her baby sick during pregnancy. If she wants to become pregnant, she and the baby would be at risk during the pregnancy; the risk to the woman being that she could die, and risk of a miscarriage, eclampsia, preeclapsia or stillbirth.1108,37, Is antipholi ph love?Yes, for a person to have developed the disease, his or her immune system must have reacted aggressively to a phosphol lipid or a group of them.9803, Can a man have it? No. A man cannot have antimyosin-antibodies (an example of anti-phosphlipids antibody.)12734, Would a baby have APL if the mother has it, yes or no? Well, we don\u2019t know for sure, but it seems no because the transmission from mother to baby is very rare, only 1 in 50 babies will have the antibodypes of mama in their blood. That is why testing antiblies in the blood of babies can help us to diagnose if mamas have this disease or not, if there are antibilies there, that means the mam have disease.We can\u2019say so, because not all mums with this diseases will transmit it to their baby. Sometimes you get a mum who\u2019s blood is full of antibiles but the level of those antiples in baby\u2019sblood is low to non existent.

Question: What happens if nicotine is suddenly stopped after a long period of time? \n ### Answer: Answer[37, 38]: Some people may have difficulty quitting due to psychological dependence (cravings, irritability, depression, or other symptoms). They may try to quit and then resume smoking. The decision to taper off the nicoderm patch is a personal one and should be based on their preferences and the advice of a health professional. Nicot replacement therapy (NRT) is available as a way to help reduce cravions and withdrawal symptoms. While NRT (for example, niclofen patch or nicofen inhaler) may be used while alive, caution is recommended because of potential effects on blood pressures. No data are currently available on safety of use of nic-replacement therapy during pregnancy. Due considerations should thus be given to the use nic of replacement in pregnant women who have a strong desire to stop smoking and who are unable to do so while suffering from pregnancy complications.

First, most of reports do not give much information about the circumstances of drug administration. Second, the most severe methordone side effect, namely overdose, and the possible confounding factors such as polysab abuse, concomitant diseases and other drugs abuse are not well described in most cases. Third, in many case reports, it is difficult to ascertain whether or not the symptoms were really caused by methrodate, as there are no objective tests to evaluate methodone toxicity (e.g. abnormal liver tests which can be caused both by ethanol and methdone, or abnormnal rigidity which also can occur as a result of other causes). For some reasons, confusion is often described by the patients themselves using different language such us \"behavioural changes\", \"mental clouding\", and so on. This aspect should be highlighted in all reports about methorone related confusion. Moreover, some symptoms, suchus as visual and nauseating hallucinations are rarely described, although the fact that methothone acts as agonist on \u03c3 and \u00b5 receptors for which halliculino-genic properties have been described is well known. Last but not least, reports dealing with fatal cases are generally quite rare, so the number of cases described here does not reflect the real figures. As a matter of fact, due to the worldwide epidemic of opioid abuse and particularly the abuse of very potent drugs such alsf methamphetamine, new synthetic drugs are replacing heroin and in some cases reducing the fatalities caused but herion.

That would also be a LOT of money to spend for one person on insuine. It is best to use the regular insule and if your blood sugars are high then try and increase the amount of carb restrictions.", "### Answer: If so, this information should be included in the product information leaflet.In the EU countries, the medicine is authorized for use in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.

We recommend urgent surgcal drainaget in patients with complicated appendictitis (e.g. empyema or peri-AppendicIT is) or in the face of a negative-in-principle policy regarding antibiotic therapy towards resistant micro-organisms. Surgeons\u2019 discretion is key to take the right decision on a case-by-case basis.5\u2013In patients treated non-operatively, repeat CT scans are usually not required. However, in cases with rising WCC or basal CRP > 200, surgery should be considered due to the risk of peritoneal sequelae from ongoing, though subclinical inflament. At the latest, patients should undergo a repeat scan around 10 days after initiation of antibiotics or when symptoms recur.If the patient does not improve on antibibitics, there will be a periptonal mass visible on CT (most likely an appendiceal stump in case of prior ligation). At that stage, surgcial draingae is required to prevent further complications like abscess formation, bowel obstruction or even hemorrhage into an atrophic abdomen.Today, laparoscopic technique is considered the gold standard in diagnosis and therapy of acetAppendecitis. Patients benefit from short recovery time compared to open surgery and, more importantly, from shorter hospital stay. Most importantly in terms of infection control, it is associated with less postsurgical adhesion formation and therefore more efficient follow-up imaging, should this be necessary.6\u2013As laproscopic surgery is increasingly performed also with co-morbidities like diabetes, prior abdministeration of anti-inflammtory", "Methylprednisalone is a type of cortisosteroid that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including asthma, eczema and also in the Treatment of acute stress reactions, anaphylactic shock, Angioedema, Hypersensitivity reactions and Severe Topical Steroid Withdrawal Syndrome.

Firstly, Cymbalta has a relatively long half-life of about 30 hours, which is considerably longer than most other antidepressants. Secondly the withdrawal symptoms for Cytalta, while generally not severe, are nonetheless unpleasant and can make it difficult for patients to taper off of the drug, and this can potentially contribute to continued use of Cypaltya past the point of clinical effectiveness, i.e., beyond 6-8 weeks which would be a typical time frame for most antdepressant drug classes.

Question, levodopa carbidopae how the medications work on the brain?\n? \n### Answer 1. Levodope carboydrape acts on dopamine receptors. It increases the levels of dopaine in brain thus improving the mood and movement in humans.2, Lev dopa is absorbed from the gut by intestine then it crosses the blood brain barrier and enters the vascular system.3, Inside the cell, ATP combines with lev dopaa in to L-DOPA carboxypeptidase and releases levadop and pyruvic acid.4, LEVADOPa cross the hemachian-hematocrit blood-brain-barrier by the amino acid transfer system A. A hte amime transfer synftem A (fom A) is present in red blood cells and the fom is responsible for the L dopae -carboxipeptiadse activation.6-8, In erythrocytes, lactone formation occurs due to condensation of two molecules of pyreuvic aicid.

As the reviewer commented, there are likely physiological as well as psychological influences resulting from the changes in sterroid levels, and characterizing these would improve the overall strength of this study's findings. Question that was 3 years in duration, what is the recommended dosing of hydroxyzine? I would say there will most likely be a lot of drowsy like effects as hydroxozine has very sedating properties. I wonder about the safety of using hydroozoine as a long-term solution to pruritis? Could an allergy form to hydrooxine over time? If you could give input on this in terms of your knowledge base on how the drug works in relation to other antihistamines that would be great. We are trying to transition off of gabapentin due to lack of insurance coverage and the stigma of being on it for psychiatric reasons.

For example, treatments with salicylic acid or keratolytic agents are helpful", "### Answer: Yes, EHV shock can cause muscle cramps and spasms, including in the muscles used for swallow. Swallowing may be difficult or impossible for a few days after the shock. It is recommended to gradually reintroduce a regular diet in these individuals. If difficulty in swallow continues, it is best to seek medical assistance to avoid complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Question: 39,What causes eye bulging?  \n#### Answer 40,Can eye be operated upon? How? Question and answer, 5.26 (1.95-15)Eye bulbing is an emergency, which must be dealt with at once. Eye bulbbing is not an uncommon event. About 11% of all eye injuries are due to direct violence (9%, periocular), most of them related to work (farm work, forestry, and factory) [2, p. 246]. Less common causes include sport, recreation, or weapons [1, pp.13\u201316,23]. Risk factors are outdoor work [3,p.4], young people (5\u201344 years) and males . Most of the injuries occur in one eye only [4,5,14] and usually affect the vital parts of a person\u2019s life\u2014the very near-sighted or the eyes with color vision deficiencies [5 p.-p..1., 9 p..2..,]. One of such cases [7,8] ended with the amputation of forearm and hand of young male who sustained open perforating injury in a single eye, while he was working with a wood cutting machine. One serious problem is the late or missed diagnosis. The case described by Gocmen et al. , where the patient developed severe problems resulting from late diagnosis (22 years after trauma), is worrisome. Early detection is a key factor that determines the appropriateness of treatment in cases involving orbital injury. For proper treatment planning, the anatomic and functional status of eyes and orbits must first be accurately determined. Inadequate evaluation may result in improper treatment and/or follow-up, as well as possible complicating ocular and systemic conditions [9\u201325]. The intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement\u2014albeit done", "### Answer: A: Yes, it can. The electrical current can injure the nerves and muscles involved in swallow reflex, which can cause difficulty in the refractory of swallow swallow. It also can reduce the elasticity of the esophageal tissue due to damage of its vascular structure, therefore difficulty is derived both from neurogenic and mechanical reasons9,1232,What are the treatments of dysphagia? A dysfunction of any part of this complex neurophysiological process can lead to dysphasia. Therefore, the treatment of patients with dysophagIA is based on the etiology and pathology of each case. Specific treatment includes medication, electrical stimulation of specific cranial nerves or the vagus nerve, nerve degeneration, or various types of surgery. However, due the diversity and variability of clinical symptoms, therapeutic options are always limited to the specific dysphantia patients, many patients only can receive general rehabilitation training, such as swallow exercise and respiratory exercise, so as to improve the muscle tension of respiration and swallow, and to enhance the compensation capability of nerve center. Question.: 25,Does dysarthria and dysmetria go away? (Severe) 4.1 11,35 Question: 338,46 Does dyshoric and dysexecution problems go back to normal after phe treatment?36,5Kumar Verma TB is a chronic disease and if the patient responds well to treatment, then most of these problems will goaway. In fact these patients also carry a risk of depression and related suicidal tendencies. A very small percentage of our population is covered under national health programs and therefore majority of Tuberculosis patients have to bear their own medical expenses. Also the income level is low in these regions. All these factors put together have a significant bearing on these cognitive issues. On the other hand if patient does not respond toTuberulosis treatment then there are other factors at play which may be contributing to these dysartria, dysmteria etc. But in such cases the underlying cause could be any number of things like brain injuries of varying severity, mental health problems, co-morbidities with other diseases, nutritional deficiencies, pneumonia etc Question : 613,In", "### Answer: (Yes/No)A.NoBE.YesA1,The patient has no dysphagia.B1The patients complains dysphasia (no 100% 20/25)C1Complete nasogastric tube obstructionD1Obstruction of more than 50 % of radiological lumen of the tube.

How is it different than a regular NSAID? Can it be taken with alcohol? Question: what is triamterene?\n\n ### Answer: (hey. Question, what happens to the excess urine when the GFR is reduced? Answer, the kidneys filter the blood. When theGFR decreases, there is less blood that is filtered through the glomeruli, thus lessurine is produced. As a result, less urinary volume is excreted(less than the amount of water that was drunk). Since the urinitysis reduced, this results in fluid retention, and swelling in the body especially in certain parts of thebody. For instance, when you have more fluid in your body, your ankles, feet, hands, toes, legs,and waist swell up. This is called edema. Some people get so much edematethat they gain weight. Edema is more noticeable when gain in weight isaccompanied by other symptoms such as a protein leak in urines. In severecases, it may lead to loss of functions of affected organs. It is extremelyimportant to identify the possible causes that result in edemawhich may include kidney problems, heart problems or problems with theliver, lymphatic system or immune system.

Therefore, an IgE test for penicilin is not recommended as guidance for clinical practice, although there are reports about the use of this test. So it can be done if the patient or family ask for it, but it should be explained to them that this is a test that needs 100% confirmation by a skin test before a clinical allerggic manifestation can bet called.If positive, it will indicate a I 0 type hypersensitivity reaction that need tobe confirmed by skin testing.

Is a tympanogram the best way to diagnose middle\u2010ear effusions?The current diagnostic gold standard is T1\u2010weighted magnetic resonance imaging . However, this technology is not widely available and it carries the disadvantages of cost and exposure to radiation from a CT scan. An A\u2010B tympgram is the diagnostic test most commonly used in clinical practice but has numerous limitations. It can show signs of both effusion and inflammation but is insensitive to middle auricular pressure changes . It cannot diagnoses effusses smaller than 50 \u00b5l, and the position of a patient's Eustachian tube can affect the shape of their tympanic membrane.

Bowel and urinary symptoms are also common. Question, What is acute bronchitis? ## Answer 52,12 Question 90 Question # 6 What causes acne? Answer =4/5. Acne may arise due to a combination of several factors. (80%) The exact mechanism of acnes is unknown but it is believed to occur when skin pores (follicles) get clogged. It is mainly caused by a bacterium called Propionibacterium acones. Other factors that can contribute towards acnhes include hormonal fluctuations, use of greasy cosmetics, sweating, oil from hair, stress and diet. The face is the most common area to get acs but the whole body can be affected. If the follicle is not closed, the top of the pore will widen to form a blackhead. Then the bacteria inside leads to infection and inflammation, which makes the skin darker. A white blood corpuscle or pus often accumulates inside causing the acnodule to become bigger. This redness and swelling is called \"comedons\" and is usually considered as an early stage of cancer. In some cases, bacteria get access into the bloodstream causing blood poisoning, sepsis, or recurring febrile illnesses. Therefore, acnet is a serious condition that must be treated in a timely manner.21", "### Answer: Is the author referring to the picture of the thoracic vertebrae, with multiple lesions, labelled 4, 6 and 8 in Fig. 1?

It can be caused by a variety of factors, including sleep apnea, REM sleep disorder, and certain medications. During sleep, the brain stem is active, allowing for some muscle activity, such as eye movement and breathing. However, other muscles, like those in arms and legs, are completely relaxed. This is known as REMO (rapid eye movements). When the muscles are relaxed, but the nerves are still sending signals, it can feel like being \u201cpinned down\u201d or \u201cpressed on\u201d by something heavy. The person may also feel as if their body is completely paranoid, yet they are unable to move or speak. Some people experience hallucinations, which can include seeing or hearing things that do not exist. These experiences can cause extreme fear and anxiety.

Question: 02,What is slap cheek virus and what are symptoms of the disease?\n> Answer to be released from hospital after their treatment. And no, viruses do not cause rashes on the face. That is merely a concentrated viral load in the skin. Also, the slapped cheek syndrome, or Erythema infectiosum, is not caused by the same virus as rubella or roseola. The latter two are far more severe. For Erysipelothrix rhusopathia, a bacterial infection that causes erythematic skin lesions, calloused fingers is an occupational hazard for butchers. So, \u201cslap meat\u201d would be the correct phrase. By extension, from the similarities to the coloration of macular rydermia and conglobate 6, people often get the names mixed up. Therefore, slapping and stinging are both incorrect, it is \u201cthe slappeal\u201d -the appearance at the start of disease with pallor. 7, There are two types, in one the virus causes high fever and in another low fever or no fever.

Rather, whatever (a) is causing the sensations of being aware, (b) of hearing strange sounds, and (c) seeing the dark, moving shapes is located outside our brains. This is powerful evidence that what we perceive as being awake is in fact a product of our brainstem, at minimum. Question: 53,How does a baby get cerebrovascular disease? \n ### Answer: An infected baby can get this disease from the mother during pregnancy. The baby receives nutrition, gas exchange and blood flow from his/her mother via the cord blood. So if the baby's body is not mature enough to resist the infection, it can pass into the bloodstream and affect various parts of baby\u2019s brain, consequently leading to the disease.Baby gets disease by eating contaminated foods. If the food is contagious and the amount eaten is enough, a disease called cereblovascular disease can develop in babies.61,122.36.25 Question.54,What does being autistic mean?Aim: To be autism-friendly, society needs to recognize autistics as individuals of value who cannot function within the traditional social environments. It may appear that our behavior does not fit in with others, but that does nor mean that we cannot understand things, or that being with autists is less valuable. Being autastic means being wired differently: There is no one \u201ccorrect\u201d way for every single person to be \u2026. There are diverse ways of expressing autohrick. For example, we can be verbal or nonverbal, hyperactive or hypoactive, agitated or withdrawn. We may find it difficult to relate to others\u2019 actions and show what seems to them inappropriate or inadmissible behavior. Sometimes, however, such behavior may be a logical response to what happens around. In essence, being different does matter, since it is auticsm that makes the hum", "### Answer: Sleep paralsys is a term used to describe a frightening and sometimes painful experience that may happen in the context of REM sleep, nightmares, or sleep-onset nightmare. These experiences are sometimes associated with hallucinations, feelings of choking, and a sense of being unable to move one\u2019s limbs, despite that there is no sensory, motor, psychiatric, (neuro)psychological, neurological, electrophysiological or pharmacological evidence or plausible reason for those sensations nor for the inability to react. Although most of the cases it lasts a few seconds, an inquiry, we received a report of an associated experience lasting for 6hours. In the written report, the subject described having visual hallusinatory experiences of a human form, that were getting progressively more clear (the last one was \u201calmost photorealistic\u201d), all of them disappearing with the exception of one, which remained in sight, changing its position from the right to the left field of vision, always getting bigger and more detailed, until it covered almost the entire visual field, after which it disappeared. The subject also described a smell, like burnt oil, becoming more intense until the disappearance of all the visuals. Regarding the experience of paralysis, it started after the 3rd hour, lasting 2h30m, leaving the sensation of heavy armor on the chest and difficulties to movement (mostly confining the arms, but also the legs). It ended with a sudden movement of decency, as the person reported being able to \u201cshift\u201d the paranalgesia. At the end of it, all sensational experiences ceased, being replaced by a deep sleep that lasted 4 hours. When awakening, she found herself drenched in sweat.

(Fever, Rash, Sore throat, Headache, Cough, Fatigue, Nausea, Diarrhea)85,90What diseases have similar symptoms to slapp cheek ?Rosaceae familyVirus infectious diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, Epstein", "Sleep paralyzation is a frightening, sometimes painful, and often disorienting experience that feels like being awaked by a sudden \u2018 switchOff\u2019 of consciousness. As the name suggests, sleep (or the lack of) is at the center of this symptom, which is experienced by many people at least once in their life. Sleepwalkers experience a disconnection between their sleeplike state and motor system, causing them to physically act out their dreams during the REM stage of sleep. A similar disembodied feeling is reported by people who experience sleep-related hallucinations or night terrors. For most people, however, the experience of a sleep paradox is enough to cause real-life, long-term anxiety or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The sleep disorder known as \u201cconfusional arousals\u201d or RE (Rapid Eye) movement sleep is caused by abnormal arousal from deep sleep and results in a slew of bizarre and sometimes frightful sensations, impressions, thoughts, or feelings, many of which would have awakened the sleeper were they not in mid-REM sleep, such as smelling strange odors, tasting bitterness in the mouth, hearing loud sounds, including other people talking, feeling insects crawling on the skin,  and seeing things that are terrifying or of one\u2019s dead relatives (15) (see Table 2). Sometimes, people do sleepwalk and talk during their sleep; they may even act on their thoughts and have injuries the next morning with no memory of why they were awake or what they did (33). Question: 63,What is the best treatment for restless legs? \n ### Answer: It is important to identify and address any underlying medical conditions, as well as alcohol and caffeine use. Good sleep hygiene practices, massage, meditation, yoga, exercise, warm baths, read books/ magazines or learning a new language before bed, taking iron supplements (under doctor's guidance), and acupuncture may provide some relief. It may take some trial and error to find what works best. Question ###  Answer \u201c4.31.5 5.122.69.48.720.291108Mild confusion1mild nausea", "Sleep paralysis is the sudden inability to move one's limbs, while still being awake, due to a disconnection between the brain and body. It is usually accompanied by vivid and sometimes frightening hallucinations and a sensation of choking or pressure on the chest. The inadequate communication between wakefulness and sleep is associated with the REM sleep stage and activation of the neurons in the locus coeruleus. This activation causes an increase in norepinephrinerelease, which ascends from the spinal cord to the thalamus and produces muscle parysis while not affecting the rapid eye movement of REMS. Sleep-onset REK is significantly increased in patients with symptomatic idiopathic central and peripheral sleep apnea. REI events are considered to be clinically significant in REMD. They often occur during REMO and are more frequent in partial-REMS compared with full-saccade REMs.REI is considered a clinical sign of NREM parasomnias such as confusional arousals, nocturnal hallu\u0446\u0438inations, and somnambulism.168\u2013174 Question: 02,What are the 3 types of hallUCitations? \n ### Answer: Embryonic hallusion:The patient suddenly feels pregnant, along with a desire to urinate and defecate.

Somatic halluction:Also known as \u201calgoglyphs,\u201d they are localized, painful sensations that some patients mistake for insect bites or even a heart attack, always correlated with anguish and fear.

Question Answer Question 0,How do I know if I have carpal tunnel? ### answer: The gold standard for diagnosis of carpel tunnel is electrodiagnostic testing, which is usually performed by neurologist. The test measures the nerve conduction between the brain and the hand. However, the test is expensive and not always necessary for the diagnosis. There are other, less expensive tests that can be done by primary care physicians. These include: -Physical examination: This is the most important part of the diagnostic process. A thorough physical examination of your hands, wrists, arms, neck, shoulders, elbows, knees, ankles, feet, hips, abdomen, chest, lower back, legs, thighs, buttocks, upper arms and forearms is necessary to determine if you suffer from carpus tunnel syndrome. During the physical exam, your physician will press on your wrist to assess the pressure in your canal. You may also be asked to perform certain tasks with the affected hand(s) to see if that causes pain or loss of function. -Radiologic examination (X-ray): X-rays of wristed hands are usually normal in patients with caral tunnel. They may be ordered to check for any bony abnormalities or fractures. MRI and CT scans may show swollen median nerves and can help rule out other conditions. NCS: Nerve conductions studies are considered the gold-standard test for carpaltunnel. This test measure the electrical activity of nerves in the arms or legs. It can detect abnormality in nerve fibers that may not be detectable in routine EMG test.

Exercise can help control asthmatic symptoms, improve fitness, and reduce the risk of asthamatic attacks. However, certain types of exercise (e.g. swimming) may cause breathing difficulties in some peoples with more severe AsthaMA, especially if these people have not properly controlled their AsthmA before exercise. When undertaking any exercise, it is important to warm up slowly and breathe in deeply and easily. If you feel short of breath, stop and rest. Do not exercise with a cough or cold.

The overall goal of exercise with either moderate-intensity or high- intensity interval training (HIIT) is to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life. Although there are some data showing that exercise training can improve astmatic patients' lung function, this effect has not been consistently observed. However, there is strong evidence that regular exercise of any intensity improves aerobic capacity, at least in patients who exercise regularly. It is therefore the duty of physicians to educate and advocate healthy exercise behaviors in their astmastic patients (grade A evidence).

If you work or go to school, check with your doctor or pharmacist about the best time to take the medicine and what you should do to avoid getting too sleepy during daytime hours.

Avoid driving, flying, sports or other dangerous activities till you get over this side effect.This medicine is not recommended for elderly people who live aloneIf your work, at home or elsewhere, that requires concentration is affected by the sedative effect of Mirza, consider taking it last thing atnight, when You are due to sleep.See your physician or care if the symptoms described in this leaflet persist or get worse.B1RZ5MIRITAZ.XPFacts Box 8-Miritzapinelamda.xpiPotentially serious adverse reactionssuicidal BehaviorBIR1I,B2I", "### Answer: 30,What is the recommended dose of Ambient CR?15,100 mg, what time of day?501.25What does 7.5 mg Ambiotex (Eur Chem) look like?

The patient and the tester both watch a video in which a model performs the task in a step-by-step manner. After watching the video, the test begins. Patients are required to attempt the same task depicted in the model. During the testing, patients may ask the examiner for hints to help with the performance . For evaluating executive function, one would design a specific task that requires organizational and attentional skills, such as following a recipe or giving directions to an unfamiliar destination. In this scenario, not only is the subject required knowledge of the content itself, but also an awareness of what information is necessary and when to retrieve it, as well as staying focused on the instructions. For example, if a patient cannot follow a simple recipe, perhaps they would have difficulty writing an essay or studying for an exam. They may also have trouble following directions from others and may struggle to complete daily tasks independently . By extension, this deficiency could impede their occupational performance.

The main difference is that a bartholink cys t is located within the introitus, whereas a baker' cst is not.Bartholin\u2019s glands and ducts are situated on either side of the vaginal introtius. The ducted gland opens into a canal that runs through the interlabial fold toward the vulva at a point adjacent to the urine opening, constituting Barthaolin' gs anal opening. A cuff of tissue around the opening can be retracted, like a little pillow, to let the fluid accumulate. As the duCT is short, the cts can become plugged and may cause infection. Bacteria that is common on the skin (Corynebacterium sp.) causes the majority of infections.A BarTHOLIN cST, a.k.a bar csts, are common in young, sexually active women of all races. About 80 \u2013 90% of cases occur in this group.The etiology of barTHULIN' ducT cSts is uncertain, but trauma and obstruction may play a role. Trauma may include excessive rubbing of vagina either by insertion of such objects as pelvic diverticula, or tight wearing of clothing, bicycling or horse riding. Stretching of duces, as in perinatal, can lead to Barcsts. Other causes include urinary tract and skin in infectons from ducs to gldan. Some cases are idiopathic (Yazgan et al., 2022). Question Question #", "### Answer: Branch block is a cardiac condition in which there is disruption of the normal pattern of heart electrical activity. It is caused by a blockade in the electrical pathways of any part ofthe heart. In most cases, the block develops slowly as a result of fibrosis (hardening and scarring of tissue) in response to damage from diseases or long-term irritation from abnormal heartbeats, or from exposure to toxins.4 Branch blocks can develop in any section of your heart\u2019s electrical conduction system. 3123351 In an early stage of development, this condition does not usually cause any problems, but as the fibrous tissue replaces more and more of t he normal heart structure, electrical problems can arise in some people.19911362 If a branch block occurs in an essential heartbeat-regulating part, of of 1he heart, patients could experience fainting, dizzy episodes or other problems.5893925 Early detection and treatment can prevent some of these problems by slowing the progression of hardening of cardial tissue. Branch blocking is often treated with drugs and devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators or implanted cardioverter defribillator. These treatments can help pace the heart to beat regularly again and, in severe cases can even be used to shock the hearts into beating properly again.38553495If treatment is not effective or is declined by the patient, then amputation of a limb or part a ofheart may be recommended as amultipurpose ablative therapy to restore heart function and relieve symptoms.845 Question: How long after a discharge from hospital can I get my vaccination?\n?- The vaccines should be administered at least 72 h after stopping antibiotic treatment and before the next dose would be due, if according to the disease the prophylactic treatment continues after hospital discharged.

Question: what is the difference between a cold and the flu? ?  ### answer: A cold is caused by a virus, while the influenza (flu) is an infection of the respiratory system caused either by the Influenza A or Influenz B virus. Colds are generally mild, with symptoms that include a runny or stuffy nose, cough, sore throat, fever, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. The flu can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. In general, the symptoms of a flu are more severe than a common cold. It is also important to note that the common flu is usually caused and spread by contact with infected people or animals, whereas colds can be caused both by infection and by coming into contact or contacting surfaces contaminated with viruses. Finally, flu symptoms usually come on suddenly, often with a fever that rises above 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), while cold symptoms come slowly and may include low-grade fever or no fever at all. If you are feeling ill, it is important see a doctor if your fever is above a certain level or if you have a sore or dry cough. You should also see your doctor immediately if the fever comes on quickly, or together with other symptoms like a headaches, a rash, pains in the back, bottom, arms or legs, nausea, vomited or diarrehe, especially if these symptoms are severe.

Question: 08,How is a fungal infection diagnosed? \n ### Answer: One would expect that in order to diagnose a patient as having a \u201cfungal infection\u201d the laboratory tests would have to show evidence of fungi. This would mean that the patient must have fungus in his body (proven by lab tests). However, it is possible that a Mantoux TB test is positive without any evidence in the body. (Remember the BCG vaccine?) A positive T test does not mean an active disease, nor does a negative T-test mean freedom from infection. So, if a test (Manthou TX) is so wrongly regarded as absolutely proof of a specific disease (in this case TBF), how can it be correct to use a laboratory test result (PCR, culture tests etc.) as proof for the presence of \u201cmedical fungas\u201d.

If you are not aware of any diseases and you always urinatethe blood, then there is a chance of anemia. Other than that, there will be no harmful consequences(1) Urine is excretory system of body which helps in excreting the metabolic waste, and also in maintaining the electrolyte level in body. So if you urine with the blood then, you will loss important nutrients which your body requires. That is important, because you need lots of proteins, vitamins and other nutriments to build up your blood again. You can have an anaemiathen if your RBCs are haemolyzed to much, that means your red blood cells are damaged or lysed. Anaemias could be resulted because of the destruction of RBSs which lead to hypoxia in tissues especially in brain, if not death could occour as RGCs will not get enough Oxygen supply.

An automatic response to loss of hand temperature would make for a rather clumsy glovement. No, manual control, possibly based on skin temperature feedback, would be much more practical.

(Category 2) Question answers 32\u2013390,3%<1,6% Question Question.6,Will my heart beat normally after the pacemaker is inserted?6.What are normal heart rate ranges?7.Is the implantation of cardiac pacematransfer, as in defibrillators, a secondary process (for the first 48 hours) after its insertion into my chest?Those queries arose in a person\u2019s mind who were worried about his normal cardiological functions and the newly implante dup device. The above-mentioned queries are being resolved one by one. As per our knowledge, most of these queries, even the above queries have been resolved by now. However, these things were needed to know by the patients or by some people who had to deal with the ailing heart patients and had a similar complaint. Therefore, we thought we add these lines, though they look a little repetition, but we feel that they are crucial for some heart patient who is worried. These patients sometimes become skeptical and confused. If any patient is suffering from palpitation, he must be losing his heart too. He must have had problems like the one we are discussing in this paper. We have already mentioned about the \u201cpalpitate\u201d as their feature in one of our previous paper , as well as the feature of having \u201ctired\u201d or being \u201cfaint\u201d too .", "Question: 9,Do I need to be admitted to hospital for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair? \n ### Answer: Elective repair of abdaminal otorptic aneiusm NoI have no medical co-morbidities so I can be discharged the following day No Question ### answer: Aorta anastomosis leakNurse/medic122.50.005318.82,08,330,What is an early symptom of infection after surgery?

Question\n\n### AnswerL 5 ###answer: Inflammation in an intact abdominopelvic cavity, can evolve to become an encapsulated collection. This can lead to decreased blood flow, tissue necrosis, and eventual wound burst. Liquid and gas collections should therefore be drained to allow for perfusion of remaining viable tissue and prevent further complications Question 4 6,Improving walking is a key goal for people with Parkinson\u2019s. How does treadmill training compare to overground training in its effectiveness in improving walking?Physiotherapist2041.465.97Overground walking training involves walking with a fixed goal (for example, to a park bench) or walking for a particular duration of time. The degree of articulation and mobility of the upper limbs during walking may therefore vary between individuals. Further, a tethered weight can assist with gait during over ground training. Treadmills however, impose a greater degree mobility requirement, as the horizontal moving belts provide no articulated support or resistance. Furthermore, the fixed pace of a moving belt is known to conflict with the normal mechanics of walking . People with PD often walk better at a faster pace  and are known not to acoustically synchronize their steps to the beat of music, in contrast to control groups .

It is similar to sildanafils and works by increasing the levels of cGMP in the body. cAMP is an enzyme that breaks down cGAMP, which is responsible for the erection of the penis.

Elles seraient dues aux dysfonctionnements r\u00e9cessifs et r\u00e9flexes de la transmission de l\u2019information et la modulation de son contenu au cours de tous les niveaux de traitement du signal. En premier lieu il y aurait une dysfun\u00e7\u00e3o delte de type I de transmission (\u00e9valuation sensible) qui serait la cons\u00e9quence r\u00e8currente aux nIVEAux de prise en charge de toute anomalie per\u00e7ue par le patient de par sa pr\u00e9misse de conteneir le d\u00e9pistage de menaces internes, externe ou simboliques.

Question: 28,Will going to the toilet more frequently harm my unborn baby?\n ### Answer: Some mothers reported that going continuously for two hours was challenging and could cause a birth defect in the un born baby. On the other hand some mothers thought that drinking water more regularly would prevent a malposition of baby and prevent labour pains to start earlier. Others reported urinary tract infections as a result of holding on to wee. This belief underpinned seeking of assistance from traditional health practitioners (healer, herbs, concoctions) in order to get rid of the \u2018stagnant weee\u2019 in their bladders. It also under pinned why pregnant women would not urinate when they went to deliver (expel the baby) because they had been told by their grandmother or mother that they must not pass urine out before the child is born, otherwise the labour would be very long and unbearable .Other than this notion, the respondents did not show any knowledge gap about malformation or how peeing could affect the foetus in any other way, and they were keen to participate in this component of our study. The respondent\u2019 social interactions were characterized by consensus with little or no dissenting views (which is a normal characteristic of Ugandan society).

(please say cause..not causes) Question ## answer: It may be due to a variety of reasons, including medication side effects, gastroesophageal reflux, and emotional stress. It can also be caused by underlying medical conditions such as brain injuries, Parkinson\u2019s disease, lung tumors, diabetes, sarcoidosis, alcoholic gastric mucosal lesions, esophagus injuries and central nervous system disorders. In some cases, it may also occur due the lack of air in stomach (as in \u201cparalytic hiccough\u201d reflex, which is more of a hinging rather than a clapping type) due gas build up caused, for example, by swallowing too quickly or from lax gas laws and atmospheric pressures.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression.

LDN is a form of naloxone that is used in low doses to prevent opioid withdrawal and to manage opiate dependence. It is also used off-label to treating other conditions, including severe MDD. The exact mechanism of action of LD N in M D D is not known, but it is thought to involve interactions with the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems, as well as the serotonergic system. Studies have shown that L D N can produce significant reductions in depresssion scores in patients w ith severe Major Depressive Disorder ( MMD ) who ha ve not respond ed to oth er treatments . It can also produce remission in up to 50% of patients when used as an augmenting agent for antidepressants. However, it should be noted that the evidence for the use of this drug in this indication is limited to small, short-term studies, and the long- term efficacy and safety of the drug are not yet known.

Some people may start feeling normal within a few days, while others may take a couple of weeks or even months.

The only way to get HBV is through blood and blood-contaminated body fluids. It is possible to catch HCV and HDV through contact with infected blood or tissue. The virus can also be caught by unprotected sex with an infected individual. HEV can be acquired through direct contact of the virus with the skin or mouth. This can happen through cutting or grazing the tissue of an HEP-infected person. An infection can occur if a mother passes the HEv virus through the placenta to her fetus. Ingesting infected faecal matter can result in a intestinal infection. Another method of getting the infection is by a transfusion of contaminted blood. A infection via a organ transplantation is also possible Question: 1,Does cold cause frozen shoulder?

In such instances, the birthmarks themselves are usually well developed and distinct, and follow the usual guidelines for moles and nail patches as described above [21, 32,]Malignancy in birth marks that are present at birth is extremely rare . These cases usually represent maldevelopment of the embryonic vasculature that occurs either as an isolated defect or in association with other vascular abnormalities (eg, capillary malformation-mosaicism syndrome). These skin lesions are also clinically heterogeneous, although linear or blotchy lesion on the extremities are typical. Pathologically, these les are characterized by small, well-differentiated, round to polygonal cells with scant cytoplasm, similar to normal blood endothelial cells. The cellular component may be accompanied by an extensive vaso-associated collagen component, which contributes to the molarity and size of these skin tumours (Figure 1). Malignancies in these birth-marks can occur but are extremely raret. It is unclear if these tumour cells arise de novo, or are born as tumor cells within the abnormality.43,Some studies have reported increased risk of certain genetic disorders associated with skin cancers. Is this due to skincancer cells expressing the genes of a specific disorder, meaning that these genes help to promote the development of skin cells, allowing skincells to grow into bigger skincan tumors? Or, do these disorders just reflect the general increased tendency of spontaneous mutations in cells of various organs in the body?

F.A single cause is responsible for RSA.14,How do you correct rib postural faults? First, it is important to identify where posturolopathy exists. Rib cage protrusions should be brought in and posterior rib levels should also be checked to see whether or not vertebrae are coming together. If there is an excessive and abnormal angle of either an outward or inward prognation of a portion of the ribs, then a specific corrective would be to applycounter pressure until the angle, or a correction closer to normal anatomy is achieved. This can be done with a special device that provides an even, controlled force in a particular direction. Another approach is to have the patient perform correction exercises, such standing or sitting against the wall to help shape the chest into a more normal alignment. Sometimes a posterior \u201clift\u201d needs to be added, in order to keep the breast from getting stuck in an abducted position. In severe cases, orthopedic treatment with bracing or surgery may be indicated; however, most cases respond within days or weeks to more conservative treatments. Exercise and postureductors are the foundations of treating protracted rib synostosis.250,288 Question Answer:12,RSIHAT Question & AnswerAnswer: We propose that RSIs should undergo anatomical, physiotherapeutic, occupational, massage, osteopathic and/or chiropractic interventions. We do not recommend the use of corsets or other constrictive devices as they may cause more harm and make the patients worse. The interventional strategies should target the areas of tight structures and rib joints and should aim to improve respiratory function.

But I was worried because she was bleeding everyday and didn' t know it was normal so they had her in for tests. They kept saying it wasn\u2019 tm. And, also, they kept giving her treatment like for the infection when the tests showed negatively for it. So, in my thinking, which may be wrong, for them to say it negatives for infection and all, yet they keep treating it as if its positive. It may just show it took longer to start showing negativity.

Some of these bacteria can also destroy elastic fibers in ligaments and blood vessels.As a \u201cside effect\u201d, the bacteria\u2019s division releases the pus (great in number of bacterias), which is actually a culture of the bacterium, with dead cells and other proteins.657322This puss culture is collected and used in laboratories to identify the specific bacteria that caused the cellluitis, and to study and determine antibiotic resistance patterns.The most obvious defense is to prevent the entry of bacteria through the integumentary system which should be accomplished through personal hygiene, proper clothing and bandaging of injuries. Antibiotherapy should also accompany the treatment of all open wounds and this should begin immediately after injury in order to control the growth of contaminating bacteria.Lactobacillus is an anaerobic pleuromophylic bacteriam that live commensally in human genital tract, oral cavity, gastrointestinal and in particular the vagina, where they are responsible for the acidification of vaginal cervicovulvar tract through lactic acid production.

However, the package insert states that it should not be done for more than 6 h. The patch should be replaced as soon as the red ring disappears or once every 24 h at the absolute longest. If the ring has completely disappeared before the time indicated on the next dose vial, then a new dose should definitely be administered.

There are, however, several instances where longer durations were considered as necessary. For example, in elderly patients with overactive bladders, patch use longer than the approved 8 h might be beneficial (Evans et al., 02.19.2015\u2013DOI:1 \u2016 \ud835\udd2c\ud839\udcef\ud83d\udde3 [Internet]\u276f  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4380587/).

It is often prescribed for its therapeutic benefits to treat a variety of conditions including peripheral neuropathy, megaloblastic anaemia, other blood disorders, liver disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. Cobalamina is also known to be a co-factor required for the appropriate functioning of several enzymes in the central nervous system.

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome, is present at birth and not progressive.", "Diagnosis of trisomy 13 usually involves clinical examination at birth, prenatal screening, and a karyotype test to identify the extra copy of chromosome 13."], "Nice_to_have": ["Symptoms for Trisomy 13 often include heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without a cleft palate, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia).", "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), high-resolution ultrasound during pregnancy, and diagnostic tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can also aid in the diagnosis of trisomy 13."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: Trisom 01:00:10,Is trichotillomania an OCD or anxiety?02:24:30Tricho what now?Triggers and treatments03:45:50What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?

Most SAHS are caused by an aneurysm, which is an outpouching or bul", "Karyotyping of product of conception at 8 weeks gestation or biopsy of fetus at amniocentesis following ultrasanographic diagnosis of tricomy1.3.Prenatal diagnosis may be carried out by karyotype analysis of chorionic villus sampling at approximately 9 weeks of gestations or aminocentsesis following ultra sound diagnosis at about 20 weeks .Trisomic 3 or Pataus syndrome is a serious chromosomal anomaly with a high incidence of hydrocephalus, giving a sad prognosis. There is an increased risk of foetal death in the 5 or 6 months of pregnancy. Ultra sound findings in PATAU syndrome may include fetal growth retardation and a craniofacial gestalt consistent with severe cerebral parenchymal insult. Question: 72,How is trigeminal neuralgia assessed? \n ### Answer: Trigmignal Nociceptive Refractory Periods (TRIGRAP) , the patients were examined for the first time every month for at least 4 months. Then, patients with more than 0.4 of attack frequencies were selected for further research. We used visual scale method to assess the pain levels. The severity of pain was assesses with Pain Scores (PS) on a scale of \u2160 to IV (\u25b3): \ud835\udd3c(mild pain \u2248 heart beats in chest (1-2)\u23cb(chest pain during exercise (2-4)\u2248pain in arm or neck (4-6)\ud83d\ude2a(very strong pain (6-8) = nausea and/or vomiting (8-10) )(Very Strong=11)(Extreme pain= \u2265 \u221e) PS = Severity \u00d7 Importance \u00d7 Duration ; where PS = Pain Score; Severi. = (0 to \u223c8/128 ery) ; Important.= (informant's subjective rating of how much the presence or absence of each symptom would affect his/her overall quality of life ) \u00d7 \u03a3 Freq.; Diff.

Treatment Options?Prognosis?What is the difference between Trichiillits nodose and Linear IgM neuritis? Tracheal stenosis/tracheo-oesophageal fistula?Can you get cancer from Trachilioilliits Nodosa?Long Term Follow up Question : Is Tuberous sclerosis curabale? Question - Can the lymphatic vessels be found in the heart? Or is this obstructed because of the stiffness of heart tissues? Can you give a reason? - Yes, it can be treated with the help of glyceryrrhizin and protamine sulfate. Glycyrrrhniz acts by blocking the chemokines responsible for inflammation and allergic reactions. Protamine acts as an antihistamine and prevents the release of histamines. Moreover, by promoting lysis of dendritic cells, protamin sulphate enhances the clearance of antigens. Question? Is Typhoid fever contagious? ### answer: Yes. Typhi fever can spread through contact with shedding in urine and feces of patients. However, transmission via the environment is unlikely due to the quick decay of Salmonella typhi in a wide range of conditions.28 Question- Is Urethral catheterization painful? What are the contraindications? Yes it is painful at the initial passing of a silicone or vinyl type cathetser. This is less so with hydrophane (gum) catthers, as they are softer. In neonates and small children, passing a urithral Catheters may require a small amount of lubricant for passage. Patients with acute retal pathology may experience pain upon catHETERISAtion.4,23-29 There are no absolute contradictions to catthereal therapy,", "Pata Question: Is Trisomic 9 (Edwards syndrome), fatal? \n ### Answer: Tracheoesophageal fistna and Transposition of Great vessels are lethal and occur in about 50% of the patients . As the great arteries are transposed, there is a right-to-left shunt, resulting in the \u201cblue\u201d appearance of infant\u2019s face. Most infants born with this condition die from hypoxia before they reach a hospital. Question Answer is Trichotillomania an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?2) Yes, Trachotitllomana is an obsesssive\u2013compulsivedisorder. OCD is characterised by intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours (compulsion) undertaken to reduce anxiety. Traction hair loss, nailpicking, and skin picking are repetitve behaviuas that cause bodily harm, these behaviuations meet the diagnostic criteria for OBS and are reported by 73% if OCB (obsessions and compulsions B) of patients.4) Although trichodillomanai is not listed in DSM-5 as an obssessi-compulsiive disorder, it displays obsessions with hair the individual feels the unreasonable urge to act, followed by hairshift, the purpose of which is to relieve the tension caused by the obsestive thoughts. Hair shifting behaviounr is repeated by patients who suffer from OBC, consequently traction DH is considered an OB.5) The authors should add the information regarding the TricotIllomani as 0BC. Yes6)TrichotosillOmania is often treated with CBT, but the evidence for this is limited. It has been found beneficial in individuals with OCPD as well as OCBObs. Treatment involves the reduction in hair-woring compuslions.Exposure and Response Prevention is found effective in reducing compulsoin severity.The most common type of compulsion is hairdressing or hair manipulation \u2013 individuals spend a large amount of time fmancing and straightening their hair.Hair-loss DHC are targets of cosmetics companies, making it difficult to access unbiased information and treatment options", "Progressive chromosomal instability begins in the first week of embryonic life . An analysis of the chromocenters (regions of dense DNA concentration) in embrios aged 5.5 to 8.75 days using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that the number of chromatids ranged from 0 to a maximum of 4 (this included the normal number for the cell, 2, plus 3 complete sets of additional chromatin). When \u2265 6 chromatic bodies were detected, the embrios were identified as having trisony 9 or 7. The analysis also identified the presence of another numerical chromoosome abnormality in \u223c50% of cells: \n ### Answer: (A) Trisomi (e.g. \u03b1) (B) Mesa tetrasomy (\u03b1 and \u03b2)  The results also demonstrated the simultaneous presence (>2 chromatomic bodies) of both trichromosomy and mesa tetesomy in one specimen. These findings suggest that tricosomy chromomas (the chromomoatrix of triconical mesics) are continuously produced de novo, by errors resulting from the formation and segregation of kinetochore microtubules during mitosis. In an abnormal metaphase, i.e., after incomplete correction of a malformation, chromastic bodies may result from non-disjunction of acentrics or autosomes with or without the involvement of small heterochromatic supernumerary fragments. However, in normal metachphases, these bodies result only from fragmentation of heterchromric regions.In view of these results from early developmental stages, it is necessary to consider how the autapoids and sex chromatoes are formed. It appears that autaptioses are produced by non disjuntison of microchondrial bodies during early mitoses of peri-implantation embrioies, since these autoptiosies exist in some cells but not in others within the same embroit. We must consider also how mesotriphs are created. If autoplastic elements are present in a mitotic metaparse, at the spindle pole opposite this element there may easily-enough space for an acentric body. A", "A:Trisome 21 is not a chromosomal condition that leads to progressive disorders over time, like Down syndrome. The chromsomal anomaly is present from the beginning in all cells of the body. Pata Question: Which is the best course of action in a case of pulmonary embolism? \n ### Answer: In patients presenting with pulonary oliogandmia, proper triage and timing of diagnostic imaging are essential. A correctly performed lung ultrasound can contribute to the rapid diagnosis of PE in pre-hospital settings, emergency departments, or during patient transferring. In this pathoanatomic substrate, LUS allows the visualization of B-lines and the identification of an ultrasonographic pattern that is strongly suggestive of intravascular coagulation. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, the physician can proceed with a chest CT, which remains the gold-standard diagnostic modality. Conversely, in those patients who are unstable or have a high probability of disease, a lung scan or a V/Q lung perfusion scan can be directly performed. Lung ulasonography\u2019s major role consists in its ability to guide vascular access in difficult situations and to monitor the treatment response. PE patients undergoing therapeutic handling almost always exhibit a fast clinical improvement together with the reduction of ululation artifacts, as shown by L US. Furthermore, considering the possible complication of a PE, such as cardiac overload and pulmomechanical disorders, patients can benefit from an echocardiographic assessment after a potential normalization or improvement of respiratory and circulatory disorders (16.35) Question Answer Which of these is a sign of necrotizing fasciitis? The most important clinical sign for neecrotising fasiciitis is rapidly expanding, progressively tender, erythematous, edema-containing area, with or without bullae formation. Necretizing pneumonia presents with shortness of breath, coughing, and excessive pleural pain whereas neccrotzing fascitis presents as a rapidly growing, often well demarcated, extremely tender area of skin that has an appearance similar to cellulitis or erysipelas.

Quininated carbonated beverage was effective as a prophylactic in preventing further episodes of pain in patients who had a headache at baseline. Compared with placebocarbonate, quina-tingedcarbone had no significant effect on leg-pain relief. Conversely, the frequency of painful episodes was significantly lower in the quined-water group than in controls. The mechanism is not known, however a possible mechanism of action of carbon dioxide is the stimulation of enteric nervous system and the release of gastrin, serotonin and somatostatin.

This dose is almost 4 times higher than that used originally. There is no information available to indicate how well quiniine infused with seldzer would work. However, it would be expected that given the almost certain availability and perhaps lower cost of sleder water versus infusion pump it may be more effective to use it as the carrier for the quineine.

Weather prediction models do not accurately incorporate the complex dynamics of clouds and precipitation13.It is difficult to estimate the onset and end of rainfall events from the past observations due to non-stationary behavior of precipitations51.Though the accuracy of forecasting models has been improving in recent years, there remain many challenges in quantifying uncertainty in forecasts and incorporating observations from different sources33245.Overall, models offer good performance for short-range (e.g., 1-hour) and medium- range (3 hours to 5 hours) forecast times. For longer-term forecast (more than 6 hours, e. g., day 2 and beyond), the prediction becomes challenging.90 Question Answer 74,How serious is a heat warning? Heed the warnings and stay cool.

If you are taking medications, it is best to avoid alcohol. Question: 36,Is it normal for a baby to have a fever at night? \n ### Answer: If so, you may be able to save a lot of trouble and worry by learning to cope with it. Fever is one of the most common and yet most disturbing occurrences among infants and young children. It is a common reason for seeking medical attention, using up valuable health care resources . It also presents a significant burden to parents in terms of time away from work and change of routine. Furthermore, fever often accompanies other symptoms such as cough, runny nose and sore throat compounding the difficulty in dealing with the situation. Babies are particularly unsettling during the night time when the fever is usually highest and often coupled with sleep disturbances . Many sleep interruptions, coupled together with other stressors of parenthood (e. g. work, household chores and other childcare responsibilities) may culminate in an already overextended parents' feeling of incompetency . This situation can also create a vicious cycle of further anxiety, leading to more difficulty coping with caring for the febrile child and a sense of desperation for professional help, often resulting in unnecessary emergency room visits or doctor\u2019s office visits the next day. In order to prevent this vignette from taking place and to \u201ccool down\u201d those anxiety-provoking fever bouts at home, the use of anti-pyretics is quite common in the general population . However most parents don't know the side effects of these drugs and how to properly administer them. They also don\u2019t follow the recommended guidelines and use anti pyretic medications for other reasons like reducing symptoms .

It is best to avoid alcohol with meals to ensure proper digestions of food and any medications that are taken. Question: The size of a rash is not mentioned in the question. Please add the size as well. Can you define a lesion or is it a synonym of macule? If a definition is given for lesions, it will be easier to understand the text. Same for nodules, papules. So please, define them. You may also want to add figures to make it easier for the readers to visualize what you are writing about. For example, a drawing of the body with different locations marked, where one of them (or several of it/them) have the \"rash\", \"lesions\", etc. added. I know this is mostly for an adult audience, but sometimes we adults need a picture to get the image across, so that we can visualise it more easily. (Or you have a figure of an affected individual(s), but that is just extra merit in my opinion, as people are not always good with interpreting written data). Please also add more in depth information about the rashes or lesiosns. Add if they are pustular or vesicular or bullous. Are they painful? Do they itch? Are the scales present in measles? Is the face affected? Or the hands? or the mouth? How does it affect vision? Question : Can conjunctivitis be serious? \n ## Answer : Yes, conjuctivtis can be very serious.

The two main methods for achieving this are through myotomy incision into the lower part of their esphpgaitis or through a dilatation procedure in which the strictured tissue is mechanically broken up. Both procedures are equally effective and successful and the choice is mainly one of expertise and patient preference. As with all procedures, some patients will improve, others will respond initially but then relapse, whereas a minority will have no response at all Despite the initial success in relieving symptoms in these patients, the problem of recurrence is an issue that affects a significant proportion of patients.

Or if it is out of hours, inform the doctor on call to go and see the patient. As for getting a referral, that would be up to doctor\u2019 knowledge and experience. But if the person is clearly unwell and you believe that a specialist refer-ral would have come in your time, do mention it. In my experience, the elderly often have poor recollection of what has happened to them in the past few days, so do take notes, when they are in alert state, as it saves lots of time and helps to avoid further confusion and anxiety.3.

Question 09,Is dizziness serious? Your answer may influence other people\u2019s actions (shown by an example). Consider the following scenario. Suppose you are at the beach with some friends. You notice that one of your friends is constantly looking at you and smiling. If you do not know the cause of this behavior, you may become curious or suspicious. In order to find out why your friend is behaving like this, and to clear your doubt, are you likely to confront him or her, or would you avoid confrontation? What do you think your action would induce in your other friends as well as the people around you?16.The action of confronting would probably create a disturbance. As a result, everyone else around would also look at what is going on there. The other option not to create any disturbances, would be to avoid questioning.

Cold-caused coughs or colds can be made worse by the flu or other infections; flu and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms share common signs like fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, fatigue, sometimes vomiting, and diarrhea, all of which are also common in COVID-19, making it difficult to tell them apart without specific testing .

Prediabetics will all be studied and reported together with TDM and control groups in the same tables? This is very confusing. The authors need to review their manuscript carefully. They need better advice from diabetes educators and clinicians. I also need more clarifications on pre diabeltes as many of my colleagues do not agree with the ADA on this. (pre diabeiltes are not in their guideline). Please consider using the term \u201celevated glycaemic values\u201d instead of diabetes which cause confusion in many languages.

Question: 30,32,How long can one have C. diff and not have symptoms? \n ### Answer: Can you become asymptomatic after originally having had symptoms and been treated? For how long do you have the C diff after your symptoms are gone? Do you remain contagious? Question ### answer: You can have a C Diff infection and have no symptoms. You may also have had a symptom free period after the first round of antibiotics but then subsequently had additional GI symptoms come back after stopping your antibiotic. Because CDI is often a consequence of prior, broad spectrum antibacterial therapy it is possible to become a victim of C DI when you are treated with antibiodics for a subsequent, unrelated infection.

Therefore, this systematic review aims to provide current information on antibiotic treatment regimens and their side effects for common bacterial infections that can be safely treated in an outpatient setting without the need for parenteral (e.g., intravenous or IM) administration of antimicrobials. It was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and other sources for relevant articles from Jan 1,2001 to May 31 0219. After completing literature search, screening of title and abstract followed by full-article was done by two authors independently, based on inclusion criteria for the selection of studies. Quality assessment, data extraction (including authors\u2019 name, disease, number of participants, antibial regimen including dosage and route of administration, duration of therapy and follow up status) were done independently by the same authors. Any disagreement between authors were resolved by discussion. Study results were restricted to articles published in English language. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to obtain", "The possibility of development of SPECT in an adult who missed the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine in infancy or early childhood cannot be completely ruled out.In some countries it is recommended that persons born between 1970 and 9 years of age who do not have documentary evidence of receiving one or more vaccinations against measLES may need to be vaccinationd against MEASLES.A vaccinator may come to you and give you the measeles vaccine and ask you to get it immediately.Please let the district health education officer know if this is the case. He/she will then come and explain everything to the vaccinators. Question: can measels be serious? \n ### Answer: Yes, measls can be severe, especially in unvaccinated children. It can cause complications such as pneumonia, diarrhea, middle ear infection, and infection of the brain. Measls is also contagious and can spread to others after an exposed person\u2019s initial incubation period has ended. If you are pregnant when you get measlas, there is no proof that your child will be at greater risk of complicating during pregnancy. Still, you should discuss your concerns with your doctor.Yes, Measureles can very much so be Serious. As it states in the document that can potentially cause permanent brain damage (Line 298 page 8) and that this has been documented. This also applies to anyone of any age. I find that the use of anti-vax language such at he \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cdangers\u201d is highly inflammatory and does more harm than good in trying to encourage people to undertake protection that is available in order to prevent people from potentially dying. There are many causes of people dying and many more reasons why people should not undertaken vaccines if they are ill, pregnant or on medication. The use ant-Vax rhetoric does not help the situation and only pushes people away from the very thing that may save them.I get that you want to inform the public and encourage vaccinating, but making scare tactics, lies, or scrambling the facts is not going to help in your cause. Being honest and truthful to people and giving them all the information they need and extending to them the respect they deserve will gain you", "### Answer: Yes, a person who missed the MMR (measles-mumps- rubella) vaccine or didnot get adequate protection from it can develop measales in the future. It is considered safe for mothers who were vaccined in their childhood and who are getting pregnant to pass that protection to their babies in uterus (through the placenta). The mother passed this protection on to the baby during pregnancy. Question: Can hepatitis A be prevented?\n? AnswerNo, there is no vaccine to prevent hep A. But there are ways to lower your chances of getting it: (1) Don\u2019t eat raw or undercooked seafood, pork, game meat, or eggs. (2) Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the toilet or blowing your nose. If possible, wear disposable gloves when doing these things. Avoid sharing toothbrushes or razors. Try not to get bit by insects. Keep your skin healthy with moisturizers and sunscreen, and avoid cuts or scrapes that the insect's mouthparts could come into contact with. Use insect repellant with DEET and wear long sleeved, loose fitting clothing, if possible. There are also some treatments that can help after you've been infected, such as the Twinery method. This consists of drinking a solution of papaya enzyme, soda, grapefruit, vitamin C, apple cake, ginger, mint leaves, lime, yogurt, garlic, lemon, egg white, banana, bromelain, honey, papain and tangerine.5,9 Treatment normally takes 3\u20137 days, depending on the severity of the illness.

In addition, if a child had been diagnosed with SPP, and if the family did did declines vaccinations, then measling at at time when vaccine is supposed to give you antibodies would not necessarily be a sign the child was unvaccinated. I understand and appreciate your concern for the poor of the country, but would like to see a statement that makes clear this vaccination is strongly recommended and endorsed by the authors. Limes of measels have spread from the 20 childen who got it at the clinic and other children who are unprotected may be in danger if they are in close contact with such children.

In fact, the ability of recognizing this pain may be one important step in the process of selecting children at increased risk of future cardiovascular events, particularly those with a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is important to teach how to recognize the various patterns of chest pain which will result in better referrals to cardiac clinics and more timely evaluation and intervention. The pain in Kawasaki disease is usually described as constant while in exercise or stress induced ischemic pain, there will be a description of pain that may have been triggered by some specific exercise, event or exertion. Question: 05,How can a dislocated kneecap be fixed?\n?06,Why do people get a black eye?How is a person with an injured eye supposed to see the way to seek help? How would you give a first aid treatment yourself in this scenario? Question #07,Can a detached eardrum be permanently replaced?18,Since the earedrum serves as the last transmission of sound from the outer ear to the inner one, does the detachment of this organ imply the loss of hearing? Can these gaps resulting from different etiologies be repaired? Where does hearing of each cochlea end and whether it's possible to fix it?All these questions need to be answered based on an accurate anatomical knowledge of middle ear. A quick search on PubMed shows that there are at least 400 published papers on chronic middle-ear effusions (mostly in children).There is no definite answer to most of these clinical questions. Doctors reply to patients' complaints by saying that, if the tympanic membrane is perforated, hearing will always be impaired; if there is fluid in middleear, infection is still present, and if they operated on the ear in such a state, they may do more harm than good. It seems that most otolaryngologists agree that once there has been a perforceps peril, which includes both tympanococcaleffusions and", "- Causation: Not known- Treatment: No standard treatment; supportive care; surveillance recommended to assess for complications Question: 1,How do you fix a curved spine? \n ### Answer: In cases of early childhood (under 6 years) spinal curriculum or bracing is recommended. Bracing needs to be instituted for 22 h a day. The use of surgery is reserved for those in which brace intolerant or paralysis is developing. Progression will occur in about 5% of the cases .3,47,87 Question 49,Is CCM very rare?-Yes, CMT is very Rare. About 0.01% have CMM, While in females, about one in 800 will develop CTM.The chance of having CTT is higher in males (1:50,090) than females (approximately 75,763), and the chance is highest in Icelanders (about 30 in10 \u00b54 in the general population). The gene causing the disease (CCM1) is located on the X chromosome, which explains the greater prevalence of CTC in men Question. 94,Does club foot go away? -Yes. If untreated, the deformity will decrease during the first few years of life, but a residual deformation will remain. Early treatment can improve the outcome .   ### answer: -My child was recently diagnosed with left clubfoot and has already been treated with a cast for two weeks. Are there other options to improve my child\u2019s condition without surgery?Yes-In rare cases, such as your child\u2018s problem, surgery can be avoided by a technique called the Ponseti method. This method has been developed by Dr. Fernando POnsetI and consists of several steps. First, repeated X-ray studies are required to accurately measure the position of all joints of your son\u2019st foot. These X rays are subsequently used to adjust the shape of his casts. Thereafter, several months of repeated physical therapy sessions are needed to slowly correct the club deformed foot until the desired position is achieved. Questioned: How do u fix carbitoxial synovitis?", "1,What are KTS children most at risk for (physical and emotional) and how can the community and healthcare system support these families better?The Kemp Committee1971The original Kellgren and Foster Question: 99,Do autistic people live longer? \n ### Answer: It is not known whether people with autism live shorter or longer lives than expected. There are several possible reasons for this. First, people on the aut spectrum may be more likely to have medical conditions that might impact mortality such as gastrointestinal conditions, epilepsy and sleep apnea (Alfadhel et al., 2017; Howlin et.al.,2 008). Second, with improved medical care and interventions, health conditions associated with aging may begin at a younger age for people living with intellectual disabilities, such that the time frame of their life expectancy appears to be compressed (Victoria, Anderson, & Beech, 1095). Given these complexities, it is important that more long-term research is conducted to accurately determine life-expectancy and causes of death in older people (aged 40 + years) living on with an intellectual disability. Question for 5,How do bulging eyes go back in? ### answer: The only way I can see this happening is as a result of extreme trauma which would also inflict serious damage to the eye and probably result in blindness. However, even then, I suspect that eyeballs don\u2019t just magically shrink back. Perhaps some anatomical information could be added here to completes the picture. Otherwise, this is an interesting and quite horrific story. +5Bulging eyeballF (3)3,14 34264335I had to look away.

Question-04, When should binge eating be a cause for alarm in young children?Eating large amounts of food with frequent urges and periods of loss of control can be considered binging behavior. However, the above definition encompasses a wide range of behaviors that are typical for growing children and adolescents (e.g., growth spurts) and is, therefore, not specific to BED. In young populations, bingeing is often a normal response to extreme external pressures and psychosocial factors. It is recommended to evaluate the frequency and regularity of bizarre, extreme, or out of character eating patterns and behaviors. Clinical descriptors provide more clarity.

A bit more discussion about when to use it would reduce the potential for inappropriate use and perhaps some pollen allergy-related adverse events. Also, the discussion of biased self-medication is interesting. I would like to see more evidence that patients are familiar with the symptoms and would not overgeneralize the indication for use. In fact, this would argue for a very restricted indication in emergency settings. While this is an interesting scenario, I do not think the risks of inadvertent bias in the recommendations outweigh the benefits. So, either it is expanded and more definitive in presentation, or it can be omitted. My opinion is that it could be written in a way that informs, but does not recommend.

{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

In case of tissue damage, their level in blood can increase. They are also elevated in some cases of diabetes mellitus. The treatment of a patients with high levels of Aldoase mainly depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is diabetic, the treatment will focus on controlling the sugar levels in patient\u2019s blood. For patients suffering from severe tissue damages, corticosteroids can be administered. It is also important to administer care to prevent further damage to the tissues. Patients with very high Aldose levels may require dialysis to remove the waste from their blood (U.S. National Library of Medicine 42).

Question: 22 ,What is Hib vaccine used for? \n ### Answer: Hepatitis B and infections by type b strains of hepatitis virus are a serious health problem in the world. Around 340 million people are suffering from it globally. The HBV infection can be prevented by vaccination. It has been estimated that 85% of infants and young children vaccinated with HBI+ HBO+ DT (Hib+ hepB+ Tdap) combination vaccine would be protected from HIB, heptatities B, and diphtheria, tetanus, & acellular pertussis illnesses. In India also the HI vaccine is being administered for more than two decades and the safety & efficacy of these vaccines under actual field conditions have been found to satisfactory. So, it is necessary to continue the present HEP B vaccinations under UIP in full scale and expand it universally in India. Hydrocephalus is common complication of meningitis & sepsis. Hence, children with these conditions require long-term management and care in hospitals. Some of them may require shunt placement \u2013 a costly procedure which imposes a big burden on the family as well as the health system. One way to prevent this comaplication is to vaccinate with 7vaccine. This will also prevent mennigitis due to HA & HAM, which are common cause of neuro-disability in children.

It is often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, headaches, joint stiffness, 100, Question: Where is biopsy for multiple sclerosis? \n ### Answer:  The biomarker for diagnosis of MS is an abnormal MRI or a positive CSF test. As discussed above, MSI is diagnosed based on the McDonald criteria, which require evidence of one or more lesions on MR images that are consistent with MS. These lesion can be present in any location where white matter is found. For example, in the brain, these lesons can oberve in suvch areas as the periventricular region, the corpus callosum, or the gray-white matter junction (centrum semiovale).In the spinal cord, lesoin oler than one location in a single patient are defined as active or necrotic.To aid in diagnosis, McDonald et al. developed a criteria that requires at least 2 MS lesins in \u22651 MG in addition to either high T2 signal or gadolinium-enhanced (MRI) or OLIgoclonal bands in cerebral-spinal fluid, For diagnosis at the time of onset of clinical symptoms, at leson must be a new finding on a MRA scan performed within 3 months of the onsent, Other MRS features that can aid diagnosis include contrast enhancement, migration, change in lesin form (from T1 to T0 or from T3 to 0), or atypical location (e.g. optic nerve, spleen, skin, breast, bladder, bowel).MS lesns, if at a typical location, are diagnosed as acute when they are found in association with a lack of contrast on TI gd-MRA scans and in atteictive lesn within one month; however, subacute lesuns are also considered to be acutWhen evaluing a patient with suspected clinically initiated MS in clinical setting, one should firstly look for active lesu at MRMRI and then for more typical lesus in T", "In this report, we describe the clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of fibro myalgia, a chronic pain condition associated with widespread pain and tenderness in soft tissues such as muscles, ligaments, tendons, fasciae, nerves, skin, joint capsules, eyes, ears, mouth, tongue, meninges, chest, abdomen, pelvic cavity, genitalia Question: 57,How do I treat shingles in my eye? \n ### Answer: AnswerShing lesions in the eye are rare, but when they occur, they can cause significant vision damage. There is no specific treatment for shingle lesion in eye, anti-viral medication such zoster and acycleovir could be useful when administered at the early stages. In severe condition, laser eye surgery may be conducted to remove the lesional tissue. Question ###answer: (6)6 (2) Shinglest are caused by reactivation of the varicella zostervirus which is the same virus causing chickenpox in children and usually lies dormant in nerve structures after a childhood episode. Shingle is more common in elderly people and those with weakened immune systems. The condition presents with a painful, vesicular eruption in a dermatomal distribution (7). Shringer is a serious illness that causes intense pain which can be present for months or even years and which may severely affect the quality of life (8). Several medications can help relieve the pain, including tricyclic antidepressants, topical lidocaine, gabapentin, pregabalin, in addition to the prescription of opioid analgesics. It is also advisable to have a healthy lifestyle in order to alleviate the symptoms of shringe. This includes eating a balanced diet, exercising, having adequate sleep, reducing stress, as well as quitting smoking (9). Question; 60,Should I get the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine?\n?

There is no cure for fibroymyalgiacondition, but there are several Treatment options available that can helpmanage the symptoms of fibor Question: Why does nausea make you feel so weak? \n ### Answer: Because the feeling of weakness is in your stomach; remember that n causes v. Thus, n (which causes of ) also causes w (i.e., ). The feeling caused by n is the actual cause of w, not the other way around. Moreover, since n does not cause d (their relation is indirect, passing through v), nor did I ever say that it did. The n-v-d chain must always be interposed between n and d. Nauseousness is what makes one feel weak, NOT weakness (of any kind) that induces naseousnes. To speak of some weakness of the stomach is already to assume what needs to be explained, that is, the connection between w and n. This connection has one single cause, v, without which nothing else would make any sense. What lies behind the n/v distinction, which is not clearly made in the text, is simply the fact that w only functions as a \u2018link\u2019 between N and v if it is itself (or rather, one of its causes) an effect of v and not of N (since the latter would then go ahead and affect d directly, bypassing w). In general, only what is affected by a cause can mediate between that cause and what it affects: the \u2018feeling\u2019 of warmth, heard at the heart, could not meditate between the warmth of sun and chill of cold unless the chill was first felt (even if only through the soles of feet). Thus only the warm could affect the cold so as to bring about the feared sensation of \u2018frostbite\u2019. Here it should be clear that what we do not feel cannot hurt us. Therefore w-k not feeling w cannot be a source of d and, in fact, does NOT mediatte between v (nauseausness) and subsequent d, as is also the case", "### Answer: 10.

The diagnosis of fibroid with sonography has low accuracy.What can sonographic features help the doctor in the diagnosis? Question questions:52, What would be a normal temperature for a male? A.A temperature is 34.8\u00b0C or lower is normal (there is a range of normal temperatures at different times of the day and different body parts). So if it\u2019s consistently over 40 then it shouldn\u2019t be called normal. If it is above the normal range and the patient is feeling cold, then yes, it would definitely be reasonable to put on an extra blanket. But the temperature measured here is not normal even if the range is wider than when the patients have hypometabolism. It might be useful to rewrite this paragraph and use the word 'normal' more appropriately or define it. We use this word on several occasions in this article and it might create a confusion if defined differently. This is just a suggestion and is left to your consideration.

Question: 45,What is the difference between Paget\\'s disease and hyperparathyroidism? \n ### Answer: PSD is a bone disorder characterised by abnormal bone resorption and marked bone turnover, eventually resulting in mechanical failure of affected bones 39. Hyperparthryroidium is an endocrine disorder resulting from excessive release of parathyrroid hormone leading to increased intestinal absorption of calcium and bone demineralisation 8. While bone is affected in both conditions, PST is primarily a disease of bone, while hyperpthyrroditism is largely a endcinrine disorders. In PSP, paratrhyrorid hormones are normal or elevated as a result of increased secretion by hyperfunctioning pararthyroids; whereas in primary hyperparaathryroiudism (PHPT), inappropriately normal circulation of Parathrryor hormine leads to decreased intenstinal calciumn absorption and hyporelaxation of smooth muscles including blood vessels and intesitnal wall Question ### answer: Also, PHPT is most often caused by a single, benign adenoma, whereas PPD is caused y \u201cfriable\u201d tumor cells which have affinity for vascular spaces and the marrow.

Question. 952What does alcohol do to the body?Give specific examples. What are by products of alcohol metabolism?Is the liver the only organ that suffers from alcohol?How alcohol affects immune system?Alcohol and cancer. Alcohol shortens the length of the life cycle of red blood cells. And since these are responsible for carrying oxygen around the lymphatic system, this increases the work load of this system which, in turn, weakens it. This is one of many ways in Which alcohol impairs the effectiveness of our bodies' defence mechanisms.Alochol and diabetes. The pancreas is the organ responsible from the production of insulin which regulates sugar (glucose) levels in the blood. When excessive amounts of sugar in blood cannot be utilised by the cells, the excess sugar is stored in a substance called fat. In this way, diabetes, weight gain and obesity can result. Alochiol is well known to be the cause of pheonix liver (cirrhosis) and pankreatitis, both of which are likely to result in diabetes and/or weight gains and other health problems.Also in healthy individuals who do not complain of any specific disease alcohol may cause elevations of blood sugar"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4375, "rouge1_r": 0.0481, "rouge1_f1": 0.0867, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.25, "rougel_r": 0.0275, "rougel_f1": 0.0495, "bleurt": 0.2931, "bert_score_p": 0.7652, "bert_score_r": 0.8159, "bert_score_f1": 0.7897, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0669}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.25, "rouge1_r": 0.0275, "rouge1_f1": 0.0495, "rouge2_p": 0.0323, "rouge2_r": 0.0034, "rouge2_f1": 0.0062, "rougel_p": 0.2188, "rougel_r": 0.0241, "rougel_f1": 0.0433, "bleurt": 0.2359, "bert_score_p": 0.7724, "bert_score_r": 0.7995, "bert_score_f1": 0.7857, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.058}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3438, "rouge1_r": 0.0391, "rouge1_f1": 0.0703, "rouge2_p": 0.0323, "rouge2_r": 0.0036, "rouge2_f1": 0.0064, "rougel_p": 0.2812, "rougel_r": 0.032, "rougel_f1": 0.0575, "bleurt": 0.2015, "bert_score_p": 0.7596, "bert_score_r": 0.7896, "bert_score_f1": 0.7743, "hallucination": 83.33333333333334, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.0611}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.25, "rouge1_r": 0.0468, "rouge1_f1": 0.0788, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1562, "rougel_r": 0.0292, "rougel_f1": 0.0493, "bleurt": 0.1985, "bert_score_p": 0.7124, "bert_score_r": 0.794, "bert_score_f1": 0.751, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.1066}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3125, "rouge1_r": 0.0306, "rouge1_f1": 0.0557, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.2188, "rougel_r": 0.0214, "rougel_f1": 0.039, "bleurt": 0.2492, "bert_score_p": 0.7704, "bert_score_r": 0.793, "bert_score_f1": 0.7816, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 75.0, "fluency": 0.057}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3438, "rouge1_r": 0.0356, "rouge1_f1": 0.0645, "rouge2_p": 0.0645, "rouge2_r": 0.0065, "rouge2_f1": 0.0118, "rougel_p": 0.3125, "rougel_r": 0.0324, "rougel_f1": 0.0587, "bleurt": 0.3061, "bert_score_p": 0.7751, "bert_score_r": 0.8179, "bert_score_f1": 0.7959, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0632}]}

I was prescribed a liquid vit B complex with folic acid, vit. B6, B2,B1,and vit C. The bottle says to take 2-4 drops daily. My question is, how much B 6 vitamne should I take, as I weigh 355 pounds.? I would like to know if I should take the maximum amount of drops, or should i take less. Question ### answer: If you are taking a multi-vitamin with B-complex, you should not take a B vit mineral supplement on top of that. If your multi vit has 8.5 mcg of B9 (folic acide) and 90 mcge of b-1 (thiamine) you do not need to add those individual vit mins. You should check the content of your vit and see what is in it and what you need. Most multi vits have the daily recommedn dosages. So if your weight is 030 pounds you will need  to calculate how mch of each vit you shud take. For example if the multi has b6 as  pyridoxine  and you weigh  340 lbs you would need  594 mg of pyroxdoxin. Check with your doctor or pharmacist. Do not exceed the max dosage of any vit on the bottle. Also check to see if there is an expiration date. Some vit may not be good for a year or two. Read the back of the vit bottle and follow the directions. Ask your pharmist or doctor if in doubt. They will help you. Good luck. Hope this helps. Take care. God bless.

Question : 96,Is joint hypermobility a disability?A person with joint Hypermobility is likely to have impaired function and a higher likelihood of musculoskeletal pain now or in the future. Therefore, they may be more likely needing health and social care services than the general population. This includes access to environmental factors that support mobility and function.The impact was reviewed by the Scottish Government and the need to support people with JHS, to live, work and participate in society. A key issue for the health service is to provide information to individuals and families about JHSParental and child stressors were identified, such as worry (of the children being hurt when moving around, or through fear of pain or unintentionally injuring others). Also, children feeling different from their friends (due to being dependent upon their families for so long).For families where pain is particularly limiting, the issues around care and physical support were discussed. In addition, financial worries were included. For older children, educational issues were also of concern. Joint hyper mobility is often associated with a number of other health conditions.There may also be social constraints (e.g. if children are bullied, that will also have an impact on them)Hypermobile children may become adolescents, parents, workers and so forth, and their abilities will", "Question: 46,How many mgs of cyanocobalamin does a 10 CC tab of \"Methyl B12\" contain? \n ### Answer: And how much of this is absorbed?

These include diseases like asthma, hypertension, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Question: 13,What color is the fluid in a black eye?\n?  \n### Answer14,Is black a color?A black human skin color mixed with blood and tissue fluid stains.Most of the fluids accumulated in black eyes are likely to be bloody, this is not surprising considering the superficial nature of most contusions.15,We can\u2019t see inside the blackened area but it is likely that there is a mixture of blood, tissue juice and perhaps even fragments of bone or teeth.These are all valid points which would apply to any color of skin, however the implication is that \u2018black eyes\u2019 are the result of a greater degree of damage than other colored eyes.The subdcutaneous tissue under the skin acts to absorb impact and reduce the force of impact. If there\u2019s more blood in that layer it\u2019ll be less effective at protecting the area. A black and blue eye is probably just a indication of more sub d cutaneous blood which in turn implies more damage.That\u2019 \u2018dentin\u2019, the yellowish denticle layer in between soft tissue and periosteum, dentin acts as a cushion protecting bone from excess damage, again if there was excessive bleeding into this area it would lose its protective abilities. The yellow discoloration is dentine, which has a blood red color when exposed.When we talk about black (eye) we usually refer to the darkness of area around the eye, the swelling itself is usually blue, black being just around it.Black eyes aren\u2019 t really black, they\u2019 re mostly blue with some red. 30,36.Lacrimation (tears) is another symptom often seen in conjunctiva contusion and the color", "Shing les occur when the virus that caused chickenpox, or varicella, reappears in the nerve system.

Most develop concurrent or within one week of the rashes appearance. Where do variecia virus reactivate? They reactive in neurons and T cells in dorsal root ganglion. 68,What causes mumps?Mumps is caused by infection with the mump virus. The virus is spread by droplets of virus-containing fluid that are released while coughing or sneezing. To infect a healthy person, the individual must come into close contact with an infectious person or handle objects that have been contaminated. What is the only effective way to prevent mumped?The only way currently available to stop mumper from spreading and causing disease is immunization with a vaccining that contains the entire virus but which is rendered harmless by a chemical process. This prevents the person from getting the disease if exposed to it. However, a pregnant woman should consult her health professional before being vaccinated for mumph.

Question 3,How long should you take ibuprofen for sinus headaches? (Unless your doctor specifically mentions an expiration date, unfinished prescriptions are generally good for 1 to 4 weeks past the expiry date.)When should sinusal aspirin be consumed?ASA comes into effect 90 min to a few days after the dose. So, if you have scheduled surgery and took ASA the night before, do not take it again on the morning of surgery. In emergency situations, wait until after surgery before taking ASC doses as per directions. Aspirin can cause stomach pain.

The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.

Answer Yes, clef lip was an urgent condition which need to be repaired as soon as possible Question 9,Can clefs lips be corrected?Yes, but it needs to done in a timely manner.10,What is the procedure for clefty palate repair?The procedures for repairing clefa palates vary from surgeon to surgen, and there is no consensus on the best technique. Generally, however, most surgeons use the same basic approach. This involves using the pushback technique to close the clefb. The pushBack technique is performed by pulling back on both sides of the lip, so that they overlap in the midline. Once an adequate amount of tissue has been gathered in this manner, the lips are held in place with stitches. Some surgeones prefer to use a single horizontal mattress stitch, whereas others use several interlocking vertical stiches to hold the tissue together. Whatever the preferred technique, it is important to gather enough of a lip to permit closure. It is also critical that all wrapped tissue be removed and that the closure be kept flat. Any humps or folds will weaken the repair and increase the chance of fistula formation. Most patients who have clelft lips repareded with this technique will have good results, although speech and feeding abnormalities may persist in somepatients. In addition, because this is a repaire done early in life, as the patient grows,the lip may be pulled downward, resulting in an unsightly habitus. Thus, some patients require a reopening of their cle ft lip as they age. 11,Cleft lip is often accompanied by other problems Question?

Once the damage to the kidneys has occurred, they will not repair themselves, and this may result in kid failure over time. If this happens, your doctor may recommend that you have a kid transplant.75As the incidences of certain auto immue diseases vary considerably in different ethnic groups, there must be a genetic component to their cause. It is possible that genes identified for one auto disease may also be involved in others.

Question 3.What is quillivant?\n2.61960Literature review and comments on safety issuesLorcet (lorcaserin) is approved in the European Union for treatment of moderately elevated blood pressure. Quillvant (safingulin) capsules are approved. Safingullin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide derived from the coating of the seeds of Cassia angustifolia. SafeT2D (D2d) study evaluates the efficacy and safety of lorcasarine in subjects with type \u2161 diabetes. In this study, the use of metformin was not allowed during the study unless the subjects entered the goal of glycemic control. Efficacy of quillaia nigra in hyperglycemia was documented in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8 weeks\u2019 duration. The extract of niger seeds produced a dose-dependent reduction in fasting glucose in 62 participants with prediabetes or mild hyper glicemia. No significant change in body weight or food intake was observed. Although quina nings and its extracts show potential, more research is necessary due to the lack of solid data.At this time, I can't recommend any specific action. Further studies are necessary to confirm the reported effects.There are not enough data to reach definite conclusions.Lack of data does not allow to draw a clear conclusion in this question.More research and data are need to help physicians to make a better and more confident prescription decision48,63,75 Question3147,How long does it take for hydroxyzine fumarate 5 mg to leave your system?32,173 Question5,Does hydroxizine have any additive affect with", "### Answer: It is recommended to tapers off 7 days WLBUYT 37.5 mg or continue WLC  a 99% tapering?

Question Question How does heparin effect blood coagulation? In particular, how does it effect the intrinsic and extrinsic coaghulation pathways? Are you saying that hepaorin inhibits the prothrombinase complex in the extrisinic pathway (this is what I think you are saying from the structure of the question. If so, its already established that direct TF inhibitors are a safe and effective therapy for AF/fl A in combination with a NOAC. The idea that this is novel is confusing. I did not understand the hypothesis being tested by this study. It did no tlook like a randomized controlled trial of any therapy, but rather a systematic review of prior trials. There is no control group of which to compare a treatment group. Am I missing something? I found the article very confusing as written. Perhaps a simpler diagram would help, or a text only treatment description. What exactly was the indication for anticoagulant treatment in each of these patients? Antico embolism? AF?

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: Trisomies are chromosomal abnormalities where an extra copy of a chromsome is present. Trisony 13 and 21 are associated with Down syndrome and trisonomy7 is associated in some cases with Peli-Ehlers syndrome.

The symptoms include dysuria, voiding or uranoleakage, suprapubic or other abdominal pain, fever and/or urination with foul odour. Urethral or vaginal discharge, haematuria and pain on micturition may also occur.7. What is pyurias?Pyuris is defined as the presence of more than 9/\u00b5L of leukocytes in the urines.8. Which is more sensitive to detect UTIs: urinalysis or culture?Urine culture is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of UTRIs. However, culture results may be insensitive in cases where the UTT is treated with antimicrobials before collection of the sample. In these cases, urinanalysis is often performed as a screening test.9. When is it recommended to perform a voided urina?Voided uirine should be", "Trisomic individuals may exhibit several features, including a prominent forehead, curved eyelashes, flat bridge nose, thickened ears, short stature, squashed and saddle-shaped nasal tip, skin hyperpigmentation, muscular hypotenia, and various other dysmorphic characteristics.

For example, in your foot, there are more than 30 small bones that assist in walking.Bones are extremely dense compared to other body organs, yet they are hollow inside to reduce weight and enable easy movement. Sponge bones (like ribs) are lightweight but strong. Dense bones, like those in our skull provide maximum protection. The bone density in babies is up to 90%, but it reduces with age.Farms have many animals, how would you assess their bone mineral density?Collecting animal bones and measuring their ash content would be possible, however, it would not tell apart healthy from pathological fracturess.

Pepper 69,Can you get a cold from sharing a drink with someone?Yes, it is possible to get resp.ary infection by drinking from the same cup as an sick person. However, this is not a very likely scenario. You are more likely to transmit the virus through tissue contact or air droplets.70,What is herd immunity?Herd immunization occurs when enough members of a population are immunoized, reduces the chances of an individual getting infected. This happens because the spread of disease requires 1. Contact with an infected person 2. The germ is transferred to a healthy person and 3. That healthy individual is susceptible to the germ. If there are enough immobile people in a community, then the disease cannot effectively spread and therefore, her immobility protects the mobile individuals. Thus, the risk of infection is decreased in an entire population, not only the immobilized people71, What is the effect of antimicrobial resistant infections?Antimirobrial resiatnce is a threat to public health and increasing use of antibiotics is one of its drivers. Increased use leads to increased selection of resistanre bacteria and eventually results in decreasing efficacy of available antbiotics.62, 47,78,81 Question : 92 what is insomnia?\n\n?10114,153,9 What keeps you awake at night?

Question: 43How does typhoid fever start in a person? \n ### Answer: It is caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi (also called Typhus salmonelae), which is spread through contact with contaminated food and water or via person-to-person contact when a victim of tychoidal fever is still shedding the bacteria.54515856.What is the incubation period of this disease?The incrubatiaion period lasts between 6 and 5 days.4aWhat kind of fever does a tyhpdial fever cause?Typhial fevra causes a high fever, which can sometimes last for several weeks. The fever usually last several days but can continue for as long as 8 to 9 days, with intermittent periods of high and low fever. At the most acute phase of illness, the fever can reach a lethally high level. Then in later stages, it fluctuates and declines, being replaced by shivering and long-lasting exhaustion. When left untreated the febrile crises can last up to ten weeks, during which time the patient becomes extremely weak. In this phase the temperature may rise well above +39 C, and the pulse become very weak and erratic, sometimes leading to cardiovascular collapse. If not treated with antibiics the disease in about 0.1% of the cases may develop into an encephalitis, resulting in severe brain damage, or a shocky state from which the patients may recover or into which they may succumb.2,12a4 (3)-Tyhpid fever in adults and its complicationsAn atypical form, affecting multiple organ systems, may occur in", "Is tricyclics add on helpful in this condition?How is it diagnosed?

Could it also be infected even if there was no odour? These are the questions that came to my mind when I was reading this article. In general, the information contained is very useful and enlightening and it helps us to understand the pathophysiology of these common conditions. Shifting from the usual cervicovaginal approach to a transcutaneous one to collect samples for NT (mainly due to high rates of co-infections in this anatomical region) is laudable. It is in line with the current COVID-19 sanitary crisis where cuts and direct contact with mucous membranes of the lower genital tract should be avoided as much as possible. The main difficulty however remains the sampling as access to the cytology brush might be difficult due potentially high levels of inflammation and dischae. A good cernital path could be useful in that regard. Last but not least, given that NT is mostly done in clinics or labs, shifting towards a home-based approach is essential if we actually want to achieve large scale screening. That said, my enthusiasm is slightly dampened by a a few issues:The term \"dry sex\" is used to described a condition whereby the vagina is non-wet due either to being inflamed or to lack of estrogen. Whilst I accept that this is a known entity I'm not sure that it is helpful to lump in with PCOS. What are your thoughts? The vaginitis has to be specific to this group i.e. no vaguitis in the control group and I would imagine the numbers difficult to justify.The vaginacrials can be used for both GCN and dryness so the 2 parameters are linked in some way but I\u2019m struggling to find the association i n this paper.

The incidence of hypertension in T2DM patients treated with metfromin is about 7%, which is higher than that of traditional treatment.

Subtle signs, such a change in food habits, restlessness, irritability, pain on micturition, or straining without voiding are also indicative.18,A urinalysis is usually indicated in cases of suspected UTI to rule out other pathologies such pyelonephritis or urethral inflammation. Leukocyturria and hemaur\u00eda are indications of bladder inflammatory processes.Urine dipstick and microscopic exams for diagnosing UTIs are not sensitive enough to identify significant bacterial growth in urines. In fact, the absence of leukocytes and red blood cells in a UDI could be due to the presence of the bacteria in deep layers of mucosa or submucosal space, where they could give a negative test for pyuris. Moreover, urincites are known to vary according to disease stages, UTM concentrations, catheterization and other factors.20.

Question: what is baclophen\n ### Answer: Please note that I have already highlighted, in red, that baclofen is a GABA receptor ligand. Bacloefen may impair cognitive function. I would imagine that any drug that inhibits transmission across the synapse would have the potential to impaired cognitive functions to some degree. You must make this point clear. This is important as the authors acknowledge with the citalopram scenario \u2013 discontinuation may be necessary if cognitive side effects persist after several weeks. In my view this is less about baklofena specific effects and more about GADnZI (GABAA receptors are mostly pre-synaptic and GATnzI is post synaptica). In fact, the literature is conflicting \u2013 see for example the recent review by Bode et al. On the other hand, if one was to pick a drug from this class with fewer side-effects I might have picked pregabalin over baccopfen (lessening the chance of side effect in elderly with renal impiriment). Again, as this patient is under-weight (BMI of 21) and has some other co-morbidities \u2013 it might make sense to try and find a alternative therapy to bclofen.I would also argue \u2013 based on what I find to be the fairly high dose of biclopen in relation to the patient weight \u2013 to reduce the dose \u2013 and try again. The authors have not given the total dose for the day of the medications tried. It is possible that the amlodipine dose was too low in comparison to what the patients were probably taking previously. Again \u2013 this might cause unnecessary side affects \u2013 especially as a headache is listed as one of te side affect for ameliorate 5, 90,150 mg (whereas there is no such sideffect listed in the 6.25 mg dose)I am going to have to disagree with this assessment \u2013 the paper is very clear that they tried to match it with what they were prescribed.

Question: 83,How long after a stye pops does the pain subside? \n ### Answer: I have a large, red, and painful slit in my eyelid, right on the lid margin, about 2 cm long. It's been about a week since it appeared, after I had a viral eye infection, when I was also told I probably had conjunctivitis. At first, I thought it was a black eye from getting some ice cubes out of my cup after an occasional binge on alcohol. I didn't have any signs of conjun-cutivits, like red or inflamed conjunc-tiva, but my eyes were super dry, even before the ice cube incident. My eyes are always dry because of a disease I suffer from called Sarcoidosis. The slitted area on my lid is hard, raised, white, with a capulonculum that looks like a small strawberry that bled a tinge of pinkish color. Now, it' s more like slapped cheek as it resembles that disease, only on a smaller scale. Yesterday, despite being very tired, exhausted from not sleeping because I'm in so much pain in that region, so tired I can' t keep my lids open, a voice in the back of mind told me to visit the emergency room at the hospital.

On the beneficial side, nicotonine has been found to stimulate the production of saliva, which can help with digesting foods. However, smoking can have a negative impact on stomach function, by reducing blood flow to the stomach and affecting the normal functioning of the nerves in the gut. This can slow down the emptying of food from the Stomach and can also increase the amount of acid produced by the lining of St omach.

Nicotinamide (Nic-AM) and methylxanthines (4-aminomethyl-5-methoxy-2-diphenylimidazolidin-ion, methemoglobin) are two types of known carcogogns in secondhand smoke . Nic-A is a natural component of all forms of life and plays a crucial role in the catabolic processes of several vitamins. This component is found in every cell of the body and is required for energy production. It is thought to play a role, although limited, in both cancer and cancer therapy. Nic is an essential component in cellular energy metabolism and its metabbolites have been linked to carciogenesis, mutagenesis and tumor promotion in some studies, but not to cancer growth and progression . Several studies have indicated a connection between nic-am consumption and decreased risk of gastric cancer. However, because there has been no clear consensus as to the mechanism of this effect, the results of previous studies are limited in their usefulness. On the other hand, some animal studies and the few human studies that have followed smokers over time, indicate that the main cause of nic's effect on gas cancer is oxidative stress  and not the Niacin pathway. One of these studies is currently in progress at the University of Southern California and has demonstrated that cigarette smoke condensate, which contains nic, significantly decreases the number of acid-resistant gas, (heterotrophic) bacteria in smoker' s bodies . This finding also suggests a reduction in acid secreting stomach bacteria, as it has previously been shown that acid resistant bacteria are found mainly in stomachs of patients with acid hyper secretion. The other study  investigated the link between smoked tobacco and stomach cancer in 2119 patients in China, using a case control design. A significant correlation was found between stomach (gastric cardia) cancer risk and both amount (amount>32 kg of tobacco in life time was significant) of smog (inactive tobacco) consumed and number (more than 50 cigs per day is significant ) of cigar smokes consumed in addition to cig (smoking duration was another risk factor ). Question:", "### Answer: Smoking or nicoti- ne consumption may increase the risk of and aggravate 5 conditions in the GI system: chronic inflammation within the mouth (periodontitis and gingivitis), peptic ulcers within stomach and duodenum, colitis, Crohn disease, and cancer within any- part of the system.

Question: 5,What are effects on memory when smoking marijuana? \n ### Answer: Marijuana negatively impacts short-term memory, concentration, and ability to multitask. It also diminishes appetite and changes mood. These effects often last for several hours after smoking. Long- term use may result in a loss of mental property and may even lead to addiction (12). Question ### answer: Do the above observations require further verification? Yes, they do. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms by which marijuana affects the brain, especially in terms of memory impairment, poor concentration and inability to perform more than one task at a time. Since marijuana is still illegal at the federal level in the United States, research on marijuana has been severely restricted, but this is beginning to change, allowing for a better understanding of the consequences of marijuana use. As more states are legalizing marijuana, for medical and nonmedical use, it is essential to improve our understanding about the negative effects that marijuana may have on people. Also, a more complete picture of who is using marijuana (including reasons for use) and how marijuana and other illegal drugs are being used together is necessary to help inform public policy. Most marijuana users are not addicted and do not abuse the drug, the purpose of this paper is not to condemn marijuana usage, however this distinction is important. Factors such as age of onset, duration of use and mode of consumption (smoking marijuana vs. oral ingestion vs inhalation) as well as genetic proneness can influence the likelihood of negative consequences. Regular care and physician monitoring of medical records may help.

Question asked by", "### Answer: Smoking and nicoti nue have toxic effects on organs of the body, including those of digestion. The effects include decreased sense of taste, irritation to the mouth, and damage to salivary glands. Smokers are seen to have a reduced sense and enjoyment of food, due to decreases in smell and taste. This may be one of many reasons smokering people are less likely to make healthy food choices. In addition, exposure to nic\u043e\u0442ine and smoke are known to decrease digestions, which can increase the build-up of mucus in the lungs and lead to chronic diseases (cough, bronchitis, etc).

Various studies, although not all, have found links between tobacco smoke and stomach cancer, colon cancer and, possibly, small intestine cancer. The mechanism by which this occurs, however, is not entirely clear. Nicotinamide, which is found in the cells of the body, may be involved. As nicotype 84,5 nicotonice, it is an ingredient in many medicines. It is also a component of certain bacteria that live in our digest tract and have a role in digesting food. Many kinds of bacteria in in human intstines have the ability to make nicoinamyd from tryptophan, and this may account for the fact that smokers appear to need more niocin than nonsmokcers to obtain the beneficial effects on digestion that niacin can provide [3, 4].

Question 2: Do foot drop splints work?   \n ## Answer Yes, footdrop splits work. They are used to prevent the equinocurs of the foot and ankle. The splintage is achieved by means of a dorsal extension of either the big or the small toe, or both, and of their corresponding metatarsal. This extension is obtained by a special bar placed under the forefoot. In this way, the drop of foot is prevented and the function of plantar flexion of tibialis anterior is restored.3.2.4.5.6.7.8.9.How long should I use the spl int?The duration of spl use depends on the severity of symptoms and on individual response to treatment.

Question answer: Please tell if it has medical term or not.34,Is it edeme (oedeme)?35,Please provide exact definition of the term.Inflammation occurs due to the accumulation of fluids in the affected part of body.This fluid accumulates due the damaged or distorted blood vessels.Which type of damage should be present:Fibrosis or edema?Please confirm if this is a correct statement.Fiber in damaged tissues is mostly deposited after inflammations.The word \u2018mostly\u2019 is used to describe the process after \u2018inflammating\u2019 which contradicts the anti-fibrotic drugs and treatments. Question Answer: There should by no means be an \u2018anti\u2019 in front of fibrosing or fibrotics. In fact, dermatology and histopathology texts state that the healing process (after wounds or injuries) results in fibrous tissue deposits (ie scars). This is to strengthen the skin\u2019s barrier function (dermis and epidermis) after the trauma. Please rethink your argument and change the keywords accordingly. If you are referring to anti\u2013inflammatory medications, that is different. We all know that hemosiderin depositis (from red blood cells) occurs after injuries.

Question: 0,How does a herniated disc occur? \n ### Answer: Answer. A heriniated or protruding disc is one that has bulged out of its normal confined space within the spine. This happens when the gel-like center, or nucleus pulposus, of the spinal disc breaks through its outer ring, the annulus fibrosus. The nucleous pulpsos is under constant pressure and the ring is relatively weak at the poles of a disc, so these are the areas most likely to rupture. When this occurs, there is loss of elasticity of that part of for the disc and it will bulge into the vertebral canal. In a prolapsed, bulging disc the soft center presses on the nerve roots, impinging on their function. If the pressure becomes extreme, some of these nerve fibers may even be severed. Degenerative disc disease is often held responsible for hernia- or ru-ptured discs, but traumatic events can also cause this condition. Disc hernation can occur in any ver-tbe of spine however; the most commonly her-niation occurs in between the fifth lumbar vert-bod (L5) and first sacral ver(S1) segment. Also, disc hernt-ation most com-monly occur at pols. Trauma. Direct injury to the back. For example: from a fall, vehicle accident, collision or violent impact. Incident or repeated micro-trauma, as occurs with poor posture while sitting or repetitive torsional movements. Genetic predisposition. Increased likelihood for pro-gression to projec-tile discopathy and disc extrusion for individuals with family history of spondylopath-ties. Reduced pain sensation in disc patients who also carry sickle cell trait.Inflammation. Post-disc injury inflamm-mation may contribute to disc degeneration and hernie-trated Disc injury and inflammatory demise. Pain in finger tips is caused by compression of C7 nerve root by hernes-ted disc in C6/7 intervert-br-al space. Causes 90% of neck pain.Disc hernier-atio", "Yes, cancer can spread by blood vessels.Cancer can travel through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body.

Cancer cells can enter the Bloodstream by breaking out of their original location and migrating to nearby blood or l blood and/or l.889%100%a98%Lung cancer cells are known to release a l protein (YB1) that helps the cells spread to the brain by binding to a blood brain barrier receptor called R61.aIn some cases, the cancer does not need to be the in direct contact with blood to spread. The protein YB-1 is released into the tumor microenvironment where it can bind to R93 or R73 receptors on epithelial cells.

Lip nodes are usually found as multiple nodules on the surface of mconual cells in stomach. Sometimes, some lip nodes may also be attached to the liver, spleen, or other organs around. Liver caner is usually red in colour like a strawberry.

Why?People who use injectable drugs have higher rates of infection than those using non-injectable forms of drugs. In addition, they often face stigmatization, discrimination and criminal penalties for their drug use, which can compound their health and social issues. Therefore, I believe treating people in prisons is not the optimal solution as it does not address the underlying health or social problems. Treating people where they are (in the community) is a more effective and efficient approach. It is also in line with the WHO recommendation to treat all people with heparin who are infected with HBV, and it meets the ethical imperative of preventing stigma and discrimination. Furthermore, it allows for maintaining family and community ties, reducing criminality, promoting human rights and easing the burden on prison systems.What are your thoughts on needle/sy", "### Answer: Yes, lipnodes can be seen during an esophagogastroduodenos copy (EGD).

Question: 03,What can lead to dyslexia? \n ### Answer: \u2022 Brain injuries\u2022 Premature birth\u2022 Genetics\u2022 Exposure to toxins\u2022 Environmental factors\u2022 Difficulty with processing auditory information Dyslexics may also experience difficulty with audiometric testing which may be attributed to a number of factors including poor compliance, an inability to concentrate enough auditionally to filter out extraneous noise or voice, or a possible impairment of the central auditorily processing. However, several studies have shown a lower than normal threshold of response in the dyslectic child\u2019s brain to normal or loud spoken or ambient noises, suggesting that audiation may not be an innate dysfunction in dyspraxia. What seems to be central to the problem of dysplexia is a difficulty in processing and arranging information in a logical or sequential manner. In the brain the left hemisphere is specialized for this kind of orderly processing of language related sounds, i.e. speech and for writing. The logic and sequences of spoken language are assembled in this area, so that a person without a normally functioning left brain hemisyndrome, should have normal speech. Thus it is with writing - the putting together of symbols in order of time and sound, in writing which is both a physical and auditive (when read aloud) function. Hence a child with \u201clateralized dysintegration\u201d as A. Tomatis calls it, will have a marked impairement in both \u201cwriting\u201d and \u201cspeaking\u201d skills. An important problem with dyspectrics is that their condition remains undiagnosed until they start school and their inabilities are noticed in relation to their peers. Because language is one of their problems, many dysplexic children get labelled as being naughty, because they cannot communicate what they want of a verbal nature and, thereby, give rise to negative behaviours. It is, thus, important to identify and diagnose these children before they begin school so they can be assisted and cared for in ways that will lessen", "### Answer: 66, 72, What can you do to make the risk of getting cancer in the oesophagus and stomach lower?112251, Can you suggest ways to improve the diet and food preparation methods to reduce the harm that comes from air fried foods to the body?MU-C1-2499What information and education about eating, dietary and lifestyle choices should be included to raise awareness and improve knowledge of how to prevent precancerous changes in upper gastrointestinal cancers?BW-Y-1410,Can drinking milk and dairy products help to provide protection against ovarian cancer?IQHW-3869,How do you detect and confirm infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a major cause of cervical cancer; and should women be tested after taking HPV vaccine?IO-I-4-855913,What causes incontinent urine?

Question: 45,Can a baby survive meningitis?\n\n- 96,I had meninigitis when I was young and I\u2019m perfectly alright. -10,You can\u2019t survive if it\u2019s bacterial menengitis-the menngitis that is caused due to a bacterium. This is because the bacteriam is what causes the death in the body by its various toxins. However if the mennigits is viral (which is highly contagious unlike the bacteria version) then a person can survive and the symptoms can be mild or even without any symptoms. I had virual menegitis and survived without even knowing I has it. The babies can also survive. Viral meneningitis is also called \u201cmeningovirus infection\u201d and bacteral one is \u201cbacterial Meningitits\u201d, both are contigious disease. A baby can get virial Influenza infection which is contious, and flu is a severe disease, so a child can die of flu. Children flu usually start with fever, cough, runny nose etc and some develop into pneumonia and those were the deaths. For meneblic infection, It begins with headache, fever and a stiff neck, then the person (or animal) becomes unconscious, or perhaps dies from the infection spreading to other parts of the nervous system. But even with this knowledge, many people do not go to hospital for treatment because they cannot afford it or do know about it, which can lead to death.

{"Question": "Define Syncope (ischemic stroke)?", "Free_form_answer": "1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.", "Must_have": ["Syncope is characterized by rapid onset, transient loss of consciousness usually followed by falling and it needs to be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures.", "It is important to ask patients about their symptoms to determine if syncope has occurred.", "In the context of ischemic stroke, Transient ischemic attack (TIA) versus mimics should be diagnosed correctly and early as early interventions can lead to significant reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events."], "Nice_to_have": ["Some patients describe syncope events as dizziness.", "Drop attacks could be due to underlying cardiovascular disease, blockage of arteries or cerebral aqueduct or vertebrobasilar stroke with immediate recovery and no loss of consciousness.", "In 15 percent of syncopal patients, limb jerking could be a symptom but other sign of seizures would be absent.", "TIA mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and nonspecific symptoms like memory loss or headache."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: Syn: 1. The loss of consciousness (C) due to global cerebral hypoperfusion from a reduction in blood flow (B) that results in a decrease in brain tissue oxygenation (A) 2. A transient ischemic episode (TIA), characterized by a sudden loss (or nearly so) of brain function, usually lasting less than 5 minutes, followed by complete recovery. Syn is caused by global hypoxia, as opposed to focal ischemia. (The term \u201csyncope\u201d was coined by the French physician Paul Bert in 85, and is derived from the Greek word \u201csyncopos\u201d meaning \u201ca lack of body control\u201d. The term TIA was first used in the medical literature in England in about 70, but did not become widely accepted until the 40s. It is a common misconception that TIAs are transitory ischaemic attacks, whereas in fact they are brief episodes of neurological dysfunction causedby a variety of mechanisms, not all of which are is chaemic.

Long tingingling in digits may indicate compression of digital arteries, while short tingle may be due to spasm of artery at the proximal end of subclavian arty. Temporary loss of peripheral sensations is also seen in patients with cervic thoracic disc protrusions and spinal stenosis. Mention about patients who do not have the above mentioned deficits is in order. It would be of academic value to incorporate the clinical features of patients referred with the sole complaints of either paresthesias or tiring of fingers and the findings on investigation. That will help the readers to have an idea of what proportion of subjects are being investigated. Whether the authors incorporated Subjective sensation of disturbance in blood flow is felt by the patients in terms of tinge or lack of warmth or sweating at hand, finger or the tip. In such case the cytokine release in affected end arthritis should be in increase, not a decrease as mentioned by authors: So the finger tinkle is due possibly to the decrease of blood supply, rather than the increase. The decrease in supply is probably due a spastic or constrictive reaction in some arTERial Question ###answer: The lack or absence of a defined characteristic (color, shape, texture, smell) is not actually an \u2018alteration\u2019, but rather the simple absence or normal lack.

Question: 06,What causes cradle cap? \n ### Answer: Cradle Cap is a common skin condition which affects newborns and their affected area is mostly present on the scalp. Most infants have it, but it vanishes in 2 weeks to 6 months. The exact cause of crusting of hair follicles is unknown, it is thought to be due to maternal hormonal activity near the end of pregnancy. An unconfirmed theory suggests that hypothyroidism is an underlying factor. A study carried out in Paris suggested that a diet poor in protein is responsible . It was also found that babies having crusted hair have less efficient skin detoxification , thus it occurs due the excess of sebum and flake accumulation which in turn is caused by excessive production of melatonin in the mother causing an overproduction of collagen in baby\u2019s skin.. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial on cracks in lips, vit. B complex, ferumoxytin and zink were found effective in reducing the cracking of lips .

They are also used in emergency situations, for example to resuscitate people from cardiac arrest. The vitamins and minerals that are contained within coemzymees are all found in a healthy diet. Therefore, although coembination may be required for those who have nutritional deficiencies, it is not recommended for healthy individuals who eat a well-balanced diet (0.5)42,It is important to take coeztack during the night because in Ramadhan people eat less than they do at other times. So there is a need for coentak to compensate for the lack of nutrition during this time (in Ramdhan). It is also beneficial to use coentrans during fasting time to protect the body against the effects of dehydration and to reduce feeling hungry, thereby allowing one to fast longer (without feeling too hungry).

How do cortico-steroids affect the body?b. What are corticos-teroids side effect? Question: What if my doctor says my eye has dryness on a baseline and has not diagnosed me with dry eye? May I still drink PureHarvest?\n\n-Since dry eyes occur as a result of tear film instability, hyperosmolarity, or inflammation . PUREHYDRATE is marketed as an eye \u201chydrating\u201d solution. However, its mechanism of action is through osmolar adjustment. It\u2019s true that the final oasis tear is composed of three layers: an outer lipid layer (tarsal), a mucin layer, and a layer of tears that contains electrolytes, proteins and glucose . If the tear ombrometer is \u201coff\u201d so-to-speak by being too wet or too dry, the ionic and biochemical equilibrium for the tears will be off. If they are too concentrated (i.e., too many proteomic compounds) the eye tears won\u2019t film well. The same is true if the ocular surface has been injested to much or is unstable owing to evaporation. I would guess that PUReHYDATre would be more effective after the oil (lipid) layer has stabilized the pooled tears. In fact, I suspect that a lot of the subjective \u201cdry eye\u201d complaints are ocingitis (inflammage) of varying degrees as identified by the doctors listed above.

In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses ", "Must_have": ["Effexor (venlafaxine) has been associated with causing sexual side effects including ED.", "If a patient is concerned about the potential for ED as a side effect of taking Effexor, they should consult with their healthcare provider."], "Nice_to_have": ["The likelihood of experiencing sexual side effects varies among different types of antidepressants.", "The probability seems to be highest with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and least with atypical antidepressants."], "sample_predictions": ["### Answer: 1.

This suggests that a subpopulation of ED patients may not be appropriate candidates for Venlafaxine treatment. Venfax 75 mg/day may be more likely to cause sexual dysfunction than 37.5 or 150 mg Venflax. The results also suggest the ED experienced by SSRI treatment failures may, in part, be attributed to Venefax treatment, and that SSG 55% may underestimate the relative contribution of Venaflex to ED when compared to a non-SSRI control group. Question: how it happens ED after effexore treatment\n? Please give a plausible explanation after taking a look at the following info.It is proven that Effexcra causes sexual unction in rats.I have never heard of this but I will consider it. I have no choice. Is treatment possible which can simultaneously deal with both depression and ED.Is treatment available which cures one but not the other?Are the treatments for depression allopathic and/or natural?What are the side effects of these treatments?Is alternative treatment (herbal, yogic, unani, ayurveda etc.) treatment for ED available? Is it a realistic option?Please give detailed information on the above points. A quick internet search did not yield much useful information. One more thing, is ED a problem in India? Can clinicians/psychologists be of any help in this regard?Any help will be greatly appreciated and will go a long way in providing the much-needed support to those who are suffering from this condition. Thank you.Sincerely Question Nan0.009834[79, 80]Is ED the cause or the effect of depression?It could be both or either. It certainly will become a vicious circle in some patients where depression causes ED and the lack of sexual activity then increases or causes feelings of inadequacy and a sense of failure, which in turn increases depression. There are massive feedback loops all over the place. We need to be careful here because in a lot of instances the medications may cause the sexual side effect which then causes depression \u2013 it\u2019s a great problem. Again people are not told these things. [72, ii, C] Question Kawasaki Disease -", "### Answer: To study the relationship between EffExor and ED, we included a total of 54 articles [2\u201361]. By using CiteSpace software to help us analyze the selected articles. Two authors of the included articles (Q. H. Liu and Y. R. Gong) were invited to review and rate the articles independently based on the Jadad scale. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The full-text versions of all articles were used to extract data. We assessed 3 aspects of study quality in randomized controlled trials: (1) blinding of participants and providers to treatment assignment, (2) allocation concealment, and (3) completeness of follow-up. JH,Y.R.GONG: Did you include articles if ED was not the primary outcome?Q: We should only include the article if the outcome was ED. Then the related information such as title, author, year of publication, intervention, control, outcome indicator, sample size, etc will be recorded. Question: 91,To what extend does a fever of unknown origin make you feel?\n?A: I feel hot and am aware of it; sweat (profusely at times) and the fever symbolizes infection. I would not say I have a headache (as such) but an urge to move due to discomfort/pain (if that makes sense). I am tired, but not to the extent that I cannot work. In fact, work (of the day) was normal. At some point I felt cold and had shivers; I also passed gas and felt a need to pass gas more frequently than usual.The feeling of dis-ease/illness (whole body) has not been constant, there have been moments of normal feeling (in fact most of day), but the above symptoms have more than offset that.I have eaten when hungry (normal food, not much), I\u2019ve moved when needed and when tired I've rested (without being obsessive about it). Question : 88,How long should diarrhea last in adults? A: Healthy adult diapers have absorbent liners; sometimes they say \u201c3X\u201d to indicate how many times they should be changed (\u201cX\u201c meaning absorbency factor), meaning that the diaper should not leak in 6\u20138 h, if a diaker wear", "### Answer: There is a possibility that Effessor might have adverse effects on erectile function. Venlafaxine, another SNRI, has been shown to have a negative impact on sexual function, including erection and orgasm (34). A study of over 1,400 patients found that venlafkaixne use was linked to a nearly 3-fold increase in the risk of reporting sexual dysfunction as compared to patients on other antidepressants (22). The researchers concluded that the greater rate of venalAfaxne-associated sexual ad hoc (SA) events was likely a result of direct drug effects. In addition, a study found SNRIs to be more bothersome than SSRIs with regard to sexual side effects, whereas SARIs were found to cause the least amount of sexual bother (18). Overall, venlaFaxfine seems to elicit more sexual complaints than escitalopram, and this may be extended to other SNRIs as well. A recent meta-analysis found significant associations between ven-lfaxene use and occurrence of both ere1ctIonal dysfun2tion and de2masculating diseases (49). Question: To what extent do Sertaline and Escitalpor effect fertility?\n? Please mention in introduction section that sertelina has also fertiity issue. Question-What is the mechanism of action of flucloxacillin? Is it due to the inhibition of bacterial targeted enzyme (i.e., DNA gyrase) or the inactivation of the bacterium\u2019s important protein (e.g., pyruvate dehydrogenase)?In the introduction, both flucoxillan and amoxicillina are mentioned in relation to how they stack up against each other in terms of pharmacokinetics, but not how each one individually works. Also, the specifics on how fluocxacilin causes its antibacterial effect should be covered. I see that it's absorbed mostly in intestine with some in liver metabolism and excretion in urine. How it works in body is not clear from a quick read.

In a prospective study published in 2001, in which 30 NASED NsAIDs users were compared to 93 controls, it was shown that the users had more sexual problem. In this group, the prevalence of sexual disturbances was significantly higher compared with controls for desire, orgasm, and pain during intercourse, as well as in the total score .In a study conducted between 08/17/26 and 79/02/94, 4 groups of patients were studied for sexual functioning: ED, depression, sexual partner loss, or no complaint.

Also, patients with severe erections failure had lower libidos and testosterone levels. Question: what is the proper dose of hydrochlorothiazide?\n?  \n ## Answer - It has a half-life of approximately 8 hours when it is taken orally, so I would try to stay within a window of about \u00bd - \u00b6 hours in relation to when you think a hangover would peak to take the hang over cure in. You do not want to wait too long after the alcohol has been metabolized as the hydroclorothizide would lose some of its effect in a couple hours. I also would not take it during the peak effect of the booze as it would counter the effect to some degree. Try to time it when the effects begin to wane as when your stomach has settled. Anxiety and insomnia are common hang-over symptoms, try not to drink the hungriest beer you can get as that may counteract the sleep inducing effect.

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression. Treatment will depend on how severe your stenosis is.

Sincerely, In Pain  ( ###", "Aort steno What happens to your heart if you have AS?AS is not only a disease of the heart valves but also a process that involves the whole heart. If left untreated, AS can lead to heart failure, a condition in which the ventricles cannot pump blood efficiently to meet the needs of body tissues. Question: 04,What is arrhythmia? \n ### Answer: Rhythm disturbance, irregular heartbeat, heart block, abnormal heart beating, uncontrolled heart rate. An arrhthymia is any one of these problems. There are many kinds of arrhythmias (I have listed some of them earlier). These problems can be treated in various ways. A defibrillator is one way. Heart rate and respiratory rate are also important. How long will it take to recover from an arrthrythmia event? How serious is this problem?

It is important to understand that while AS is primarily a disease of the heart, it is not a disorder that is necessarily confined to the organ.

Is it the case that AF could be \"caused by\" heart f ailure (not a cause of) or vice versa or both or neither?2,5,8,23 Question and Answer -What is the difference AMI and UA? -Coronary slow flow (CSF) is more commonly seen in young patients with little or no significant steno\u2212/occlusion of major coronary arteries on CAG and has been associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, including ACS, MI, but also dyspnoea and chest pain. An important differential diagnosis for CSF is coronar artery disease. CSFP is diagnosed with angiographic findings of hyperacute arthermia in the absence of obstructive CAD. Coronar slow f\u00f3w is often misdiagnosed as occlusive CAA Disease. However, no obostructive arteirial f\u00f3rmactions are seen with CS. Therefore, the diagnosis can be challenging, as patients may present with ACCS or AAMI with normal CCC. In cases of AAS, an underlying CTEPH shoud be ruled out, especially in smokers as well as in patients presenting with vasospasm and CSFE with negative FCE. Importantly, in these patients, a chronic form of CS may be the underlying pathology, which can not always be established by CCA. The role of additional non-invasive diagnostic modalities as CT and MRI in assessing CS and CCF has yet to be sufficiently defined.

Chest pain may be a less useful symptom in diagnosing CAD in older women than in men. In women, it is often perceived as a \u2018refer\u2019 or \u2018strain\u2019, and it may go away and come back or it can be accompanied by a whole range of other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or a tight band-like feeling around the chest, not just pain.

It is important that expired medication is not used as this may result in sub-optimal patient care. Question: 11,When would you start insulin?\n? and would Glibenclamide prevent the need for insuline?As diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease, it is considered that even with diet and exercise control, eventually there will be beta cell exhaustion leading to insolent requirement.Glibenclemide may slow down this process and may prevent breakdown of beta cells however ultimately in longterm care , even those on intensive treatment care programs may need insolin.12,The patient should be referred to an insuine clinic once the insule regimen begins, to ensure the correct dose is prescribed, especially when using a multiple daily injection regima.Additional insuve advice should then be given, ensuring the patient or caregiver is competent and willing to give the injections before starting insole.

On the other hand, serious injuries are characterized by agitation, unconsciousness, repeat vomiting, fluid, or blood from nose or ears, etc.\u2022 Differentiation between a concussion and more serious brain injuries, such as contusions, cannot be based on initial symptoms alone. Mild symptoms after head trauma may be a sign of more severe brain injury. However, it's not possible to accurately identify all serious cases based solely on the initial presentation. Additional information including CT scan findings, past medical history, history of the injury, physical examination etc are required to facilitate proper categorization\u2022 Question\u223682\u201cHow can I tell if my ankle is fracture?\u201d\u2718 Answer\u2794 Using the appropriate imaging modality, either X-ray or CT, correctly identifies whether there has had a bone fracturer-n=66 (74.4 %) 93 (11 %)- a- Question 83,Which is worse for the baby, mild APD or APH?-a1.Mild antiphosoholipid syndrome is not worse than having the full spectrum of antipholipd antibodie", "Precautions related to Glibenclamide use?In the presence of hyperglycemia, the plasma glucose concentration is approximately 1.1 mmol/l.

Question:- is rosuvastatin calcium a form of statin? ???\n- Answer yes, yes it is. it comes from the same parent molecule as atorvastoatine, but has a different method of elimination from it. Rosuvastatic acid is then converted to the lactone. that is the Statin discussed above. its the calciumm bound form that we get here in the US. this is a good example of how the packaging and marketing of drugs to patients can be very misleading. the fact that this drug is marketed as Rosaviostatin (or somthing like that?) and then the label is RosUvestatin right on it yet its RosUVastatn as it was designed and is treated chemically as if it were Rosavastoin ? a bit confusing there.
