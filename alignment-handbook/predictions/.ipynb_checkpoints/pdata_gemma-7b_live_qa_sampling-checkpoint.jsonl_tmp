{"Question": "How do I find out if my fibromyalgia is genetic?", "Free_form_answer": "Is fibromyalgia hereditary? Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Must_have": ["Fibromyalgia is not directly passed from parents to children.", "The disorder does tend to cluster within families.", "The chances of developing fibromyalgia are higher in families with a history of the disorder.", "There are certain genes that are associated with the increased risk of fibromyalgia, which play a role in your nervous system's response to pain."], "Nice_to_have": ["Studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia have identified a number of genes that could help explain why the disorder seems to run in families.", "Some of the same genes associated with fibromyalgia are also linked with depression and anxiety, which may explain why certain antidepressant medications can help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms."], "sample_predictions": ["Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.

These include variants in genes involved in pain perception, inflammation, and immune function. The relationship between fibromyalgia and genetics is complex and not fully understood. While some studies have identified genetic variants associated with an increased risk of fibromyalgia, the role of these variants in the development of the condition is not clear. It is possible that these variants may contribute to the development of fibromyalgia in combination with other factors, such as psychological stress or environmental triggers. Understanding the potential genetic factors associated with fibromyalgia can help inform treatment and management strategies. For example, individuals with a family history of fibromyalgia may be at increased risk of developing the condition and may benefit from early intervention and support.

Such consanguinity is one of the numerous factors that could potentially contribute to the condition, and the individual risk is influenced by many factors including the specifics of the family's genetic makeup.Long-term pulmonary sequelae are possible, as untreated CDH can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, and potentially longer-term lung function abnormalities.

Genetic mutations in genes involved in diaphragm development, such as TFAP2B, can increase the risk of CDH. Environmental factors, such as maternal smoking or exposure to certain medications during pregnancy, can also contribute to the development of CDH.\nThe long-term effects of CDH on the lungs depend on the severity of the condition and the extent of lung damage. In some cases, the lungs may be underdeveloped or scarred, leading to respiratory problems and difficulty breathing. However, with proper treatment and management, many individuals with CDH can lead normal, healthy lives.\nConsanguineous marriage, or marriage between close relatives, has been associated with an increased risk of certain genetic disorders, including CDH.

{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Trisomy 7 is a rare genetic condition caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 7 in a person's cells.
