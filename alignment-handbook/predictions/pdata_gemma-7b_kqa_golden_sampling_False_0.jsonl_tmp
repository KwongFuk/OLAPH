{"Question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "Free_form_answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.

In fact, some medications that are used to treat fatty liver, such as statins, can also cause the liver to work harder.

The onset of the symptoms of type 1 DM such as weight loss, higher urination quantity and frequency, excessive thirst, fatigue, and others, can be very quick and appear over weeks or even days. Less commonly, a medical emergency called diabetic ketoacidosis can develop over hours with symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing, and feeling very ill.

Diabetes is a disease of the pancreas.\n2. The pancreas is a gland that produces insulin.\n3. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n4. If the pancreas is not producing enough insulin, blood sugar levels will rise.\n5. High blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes.\n\n<h2>What is diabetes?</h2>\n\nDiabetes is a disease that affects the way your body uses sugar. Sugar is the main source of energy for your body. When you eat sugar, your body breaks it down into glucose. Glucose is a type of sugar that your body uses for energy.\n\nYour body needs insulin to use glucose. Insulin is a hormone that is made by the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that is located behind your stomach. The pancreas makes insulin and releases it into your bloodstream.\n\nInsulin helps your body use glucose for energy. If you have diabetes, your body does not make enough insulin or your body does not use insulin properly. This can cause your blood sugar levels to be too high.\n\n<h2>What are the symptoms of diabetes?</h2>\n\nThe symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type of diabetes you have. The most common symptoms of diabetes are:\n\n* Increased thirst\n* Increased urination\n* Fatigue\n* Blurred vision\n* Slow-healing wounds\n* Weight loss\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, it is important to see your doctor to get a diagnosis.\n\n<h2>What are the causes of diabetes?</h2>\n\nThere are many different causes of diabetes, but the most common cause is a problem with the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that is located behind the stomach. It produces insulin, which is a hormone that helps the body use sugar for energy.\n\nWhen the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body does not use insulin properly, sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage the body\u2019s organs, including the heart, kidneys, and eyes.\n\n<h2>How is diabetes diagnosed?</h2>\n\nDiabetes is diagnosed by a blood test that measures the level of glucose in the blood. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test used to diagnose diabetes. This test is done after an overnight fast.\n\nOther tests that may be used to diagnose diabetes include the oral glucose tolerance test and the hemoglobin A1c test. The oral glucose tolerance test is done after a person drinks a sugary drink. The hemoglobin A1c test measures the average blood sugar level over the past"], "inference_time": [14.814199447631836], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4157, "rouge1_r": 0.1749, "rouge1_f1": 0.2463, "rouge2_p": 0.1243, "rouge2_r": 0.0521, "rouge2_f1": 0.0735, "rougel_p": 0.2303, "rougel_r": 0.0969, "rougel_f1": 0.1364, "bleurt": 0.4074, "bert_score_p": 0.8085, "bert_score_r": 0.8258, "bert_score_f1": 0.8171, "hallucination": 9.090909090909092, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.2886}]}

{"Question": "How many pills of ibuprofen can I take?", "Free_form_answer": "Ibuprofen (Advil, Addaprin, Caldolor, Mortin) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in a variety of cases including inflammatory diseases, pain relief, and fever reduction. The number of pills that could be taken by a single person each day depends on the dose of each pill, the age of the patient, and his kidney function. Ibuprofen is sold in the US in tablets of 100 mg (for children), 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, and 800 mg. In any case for a healthy adult, the maximum dose is 3.2 grams per day (e.g. up to 4 tablets of 800 mg each, one every six hours). In cases of chronic use, the maximum dose is 2.4 grams per day. In cases of kidney dysfunction, the normal adult dosage is fitted for short-term use. In severe kidney dysfunction, other drugs should be taken. For children under the age of 12 maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg per day or up to 2.4 grams \u2013 whichever is less.

While it can be effective in reducing inflammation and itching, it should not be used on the face without consulting a healthcare professional.

If you have a pimple on your face, it's best to use a gentle cleanser and moisturizer to help soothe the skin and reduce inflammation. You can also try using a topical acne treatment such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, which can help to clear up the pimple and prevent future breakouts.

{"Question": "Is flu test same as influenza test ?", "Free_form_answer": "The flu test and the influenza test are the same thing. \"Flu\" is a common name for an acute respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. If you experience a sudden fever, cough, and muscle aches during the winter months, it's likely that you have influenza. In such cases, an influenza test can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. However, in most cases, there's no need for a test since the symptoms during flu season are enough to diagnose the illness. The illness is self-limited in individuals under 65 years of age who are normally healthy. However, older patients or those at higher risk for complications may need a test. To perform the test, a sample is collected from the throat or nose and analyzed in the lab using RT-PCR or antigen immunofluorescence assays.", "Must_have": ["Flu is the common name for an acute respiratory illness caused by the virus influenza.", " Flu test is the same as influenza test."], "Nice_to_have": ["In patients above age 65 or patients with high risk for complications, a flu test is in order.", " Flu test includes performing a molecular assay in the lab using RT-PCR or antigen immunofluorescence assays.", " Flu test includes collecting a sample from throat or nose.", " Abrupt fever, cough and muscle aches during the winter raise a high suspicion for influenza.", " In most cases, there is no need to test for flu since the clinical presentation during flu season is enough to make a diagnosis."], "Sources": "https://www-uptodate-com.meir.idm.oclc.org/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis?search=influenza%20diagnosis&sectionRank=1&usage_type=default&anchor=H4280894726&source=machineLearning&selectedTitle=1~150&display_rank=1#H4280894726", "ICD_10_diag": null, "sample_predictions": ["Answer:\n\nStep 1/2\nFirst, we need to understand what a flu test is.
