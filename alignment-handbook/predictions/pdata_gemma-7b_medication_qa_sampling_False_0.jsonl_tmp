It is made up of billions of nerve cells, or neurons, that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. These signals are sent through the brain's many pathways, which are like highways for information. The brain is divided into different regions, each with its own specialized functions. The frontal lobe is responsible for higher-level thinking, such as planning and decision-making. The temporal lobe is involved in hearing and memory. The occipital lobe is responsible for vision. The cerebellum is involved in coordination and balance. The brain also has a number of different structures, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for most of the brain's functions. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. The brainstem is responsible for basic functions, such as breathing and heart rate. The brain is also made up of different types of cells, including neurons, glial cells, and stem cells. Neurons are the main type of cell in the brain and are responsible for sending and receiving signals. Glial cells are support cells that help to maintain the health of the brain. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can develop into any type of cell. The brain is constantly changing and adapting to new experiences. This is known as neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity allows the brain to learn new things and to recover from injury.

It works by increasing the activity of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA is a chemical that helps to calm the brain and nervous system. When Valium is taken, it binds to receptors in the brain that are sensitive to GABA.

This means that the patient has a thyroid disorder and needs to take Synthroid to replace the missing thyroid hormone. The patient is also taking a medication that interferes with the absorption of Synthroid. This means that the medication is preventing the Synthroid from being absorbed into the body and working properly.
