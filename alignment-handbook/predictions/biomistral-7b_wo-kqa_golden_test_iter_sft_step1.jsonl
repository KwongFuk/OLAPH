{"text": "Question: And what could be causing the white tongue? \n ### Answer: The white tongue is a condition in which the tongue appears white or coated. It is a common condition that is often associated with poor oral hygiene, smoking, and certain medical conditions. The white tongue is usually not serious, but it can sometimes be a sign of a more serious problem. The white coating on the tongue is caused by bacteria and dead cells that accumulate on the surface of the tongue. The tongue is a mucous membrane, and like all mucous membranes, it has a layer of mucus on the surface. This mucus helps to protect the tongue from irritants and keeps it moist. When the tongue is healthy, the mucus layer is thin and transparent. However, when the tongue is unhealthy, the mucus layer can become thick and milky. This can cause the tongue to appear white or coated."}

{"text": "Question: Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ? \n ### Answer: Over the last two decades, randomised controlled trials have shown a beneficial effect of omega-3 supplementation (fish oil) on visual function , , . Several factors suggest that lutein and zeaxanthin might have a similar effect. First, visual function is dependent on good illumination . Given that good sunlight illumination has been shown to be protective against AMD development in the NHS/AREDS studies  and against the progression of the late stages of AMD , Vitamin D supplementation, would be worth evaluating for its effect on visual function. Lutein and zeaxanthin being the main carotenoids in the human lens, it is reasonable to suggest they may contribute to the lenses light filtering effect. Furthermore, like other carotenoids (e.g lycopene, beta-carotene) which have been found to jointly accumulate with zeaxanthin  in the lens, lutein may also exert a protective effect on the lens. Lastly, lutein found to maintain the dark adaptation shape in the presence of high light exposure whereas zeaxanthin doesn't , may have the ability to improve night (and light induced) vision similar to omega-3 nutrients ."}

While testicular pain can often be a symptom of other STIs, the main symptom of urethral chlamydia is pain in micturition or haematuria (7). The symptoms of rectal chlamydia include rectal discharge, soreness or bleeding (7).

{"text": "Question: Can i take the painkiller and the antibiotics at the same time or wait hours in between ? \n ### Answer: 2Pain killing is related to inflammation whereas antibiotics are related to viral infections. So it is only an issue of safely using the drugs together. The answer will be related to side effects of drugs, e.g. nausea. Therefore, you will need to ask patients about the possible side effects and which drug works better if some specific side effects happen. This will lead you to further ask about their medical history and lab test results, e.g. kidney and liver functions. They will also let you know if they are taking other medications, e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs, which can be mentioned in the patient medication history.E.g. If patient has had nausea as side effect many times due to the painkiller, it is obvious you need to prescribe with a different brand. If they complain about they had nausea but it was reduced with (brand) painkiller, you may want to switch to a longer term painkiller, e.g. acetaminophen. If side effects caused by antibiotics are specific, you should massage the patient first with an anti-emetic drug, then suggest him to take antibiotics after several hours. E.g. use serotonin 3 antagonist before dosing his antibiotic."}

Kang evaluated the effects of allopurinol on testicular tissues in rats. Rolaox, 300 mg/kg body wt/day orally for 7 days had no effect on the testosterone level, spermatogenesis, or the sperm count (39). In dogs, oral doses during pregnancy did not cause congenital defects. In rodents, allopurinol has not shown embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. Allopurinol has not shown mutagenic effects in vitro. Long-term use of allopurinol without adequate protection had been shown to cause cutaneous lesions and fever in some patients in the form of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.

{"text": "Question: Does hydroxyzine have any affect on metabolism or weight gain? \n ### Answer: Patients of all ages can be cared for in a wide variety of environments, from home visits to ICUs. If hydroxyzine is used when SBSE is first diagnosed, one might speculate that the child would achieve and maintain ideal weight from the beginning if intubation (or associated complications) could be avoided. For that matter, if a pediatric patient had multiple episodes of SBSE, conventionally managed usually by intubation, and is then switched to an anti-seizure management paradigm employing adjunctive hydroxyzine for several years, one would suspect that the hydroxyzine treated patient would not gain inappropriate weight as s/he aged. Studies would, of course, be helpful in forming guidelines regarding the question of weight gain."}
{"text": "Question: Does low thyroid contribute to weight gain? \n ### Answer: Based on most of the known experimental studies there is evidence that low levels of T3 might play an important role influencing a patient\u2019s BMI. The sub-physiological levels of thyroid hormones lead to reduction in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and oxidation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, eventually resulting in weight gain.(an influence of T3 levels on basal metabolic rate is described in HEAD diagnositcs 2007) . However, although low levels of thyroid and impaired thermogenesis are often blamed for weight gain, there are some doubts about possible causal relationship between T3 resistance and increased adiposity. So, some authors  argue that clinical features and weight gain in patients with T3 resistance cannot be fully explained by the occurrence of central thyroid resistance. Whereas others  suggest that obesity and insulin resistance can lead to reduced central thermal sensitivity, low T3 levels, increased lipoprotein lipase activity, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors number, which, altogether, could cause weight gain."}

{"text": "Question: How am I supposed to put ointment on my nipple if it's pierced? \n ### Answer: Okay, if I'm not mistaken, the piercing is in my nipple, and therefore the ointment should be placed inside the nipple, right? At least that way it can't be in vain. But at the same time, how do I get inside my nipple? Of course, I don't have a syringe, and I'm afraid of touching the piercing, because it's extremely sharp and pinches my nipple, which bleeds once injured. The thing is, that I want to use ointment that is supposed to stop excess bleeding, reduce painful stimuli, and regenerate my nipple faster than without ointment. However, there is also the problem that I can hurt my nipple, or even bleed, while trying to apply ointment. So, what am I supposed to do if a mother experiences bleeding and feels uncomfortable (because it hurts or the bra reminds her of the strangely shaped piercing beneath)? Also, what if the piercing comes off \u2026 without the left nipple bleeding excessively (as there was currently bleed to no end), not to mention pain? Or is this supposed to stop the bleeding? What are my options here since this happened to me, and I'm not alone? Questions that fill me with uncertainty and worries. Question no. 6"}

Increased pressure should cause your fingers to feel a noticeable pulsation on the opposite side of your neck. To relieve tension while doing the test, breathe deeply, relax, and sit for a few minutes. Elbow and forearm should be clear of the arm on which the pulse is taken and the forearm should be horizontal. Place your head and back on the backrest of the chair. Put your bare feet flat on the floor. Take your blood pressure one time. Put on a blood pressure cuff that\u2019s correctly sized, and fasten it around your arm, about 1/2 inch above your wrist. Proceed to inflate an automatic blood pressure machine or note the time. Don\u2019t adjust the cuff if you have an arm prosthesis or brace.

Also, the upstream region of mbp gene (bioprocess to bioengineering, Ashvin Kumar (2011) 3) was predicted to further encode the peptobismol isoforms by an upstream sequence (AAGTAA) aligned with the upstream peptobismol (AAGTAA) identified in the Shigella dysenteriae strain used by Hof et al. and Stieh et al . With these results and the high throughput analysis (expression counts, see Additional file 2) indicating a relatively high gene expression, pepto peptobismol were chosen for confirmation in this strain."}
{"text": "Question: Is poison ivy contagious between people? \n ### Answer: Poison ivy is caused by contact with urushiol in the sap of the leaves, stems and roots of Rhus species, including Toxicodendron radicans. If the uncontaminated outer skin contacts the oils from the plant, the skin keeps Uisho out of the bloodstream. So, poison ivy is not contagious and is not supposed to spread from person to person unless the rash is open. Even then, urushiol is rapidly broken down by the natural oils in the skin."}

{"text": "Question: What is the best hypertension treatment for patients who are also diabetic? \n ### Answer: RAAS blockers are a safe treatment for diabetic nephropathy. The most effective way to stop diabetic kidney disease progression is to use agents that block the RAAS. Conventional drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics are among the most widely utilised. Other classes of drugs are therefore adequate for reducing blood pressure and slowing kidney disease development. ACEIs, ARBs, and diuretics are still widely regarded as the class of drugs most effective for treating diabetic kidney disease. In rare instances, medications that target the RAAS must be combined to achieve optimum blood pressure control. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are another viable option when RAAS blockers fail or are not tolerated. SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly lower blood pressure, particularly in diabetic patients who are African American. While there are several classes of medications that can successfully treat hypertension, there are no universal cures. The issue is that certain medications are more successful in controlling hypertension than others. According to numerous studies, the most effective hypotensive agents minimise the high levels of albuminuria and slow kidney disease progression in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics, respectively. In treating diabetic nephropathy, RAAS-blocking medications are the most prevalent option; however, various specialists also favour the usage of non-RAAS-blocking drugs, specifically SGLT-2 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors.The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to block the formation of angiotensin II is the gold standard for treating nephropathy in patients with diabetes. A recent case study revealed that both ACEIs and ARBs benefitted formic acid/alzfheimer's disease (FAD) patients. It was shown that the use of ACE inhibitors lowered the level of Ang II by competing with angiotensin 2 receptor 1 (AT1). It was subsequently found that angiotensin 2 receptor 2 (AT2"}

When their disease is controlled with sulfasalazine, women can be safely conceived and treated with sulfasalazine throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding .The azasulfhonic (5-aminosalicylic) acid drugs have been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly when used during the first trimester of pregnancy, so these drugs should be avoided in the first trimester.Methotrexate is potentially teratogenic and should be avoided in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester due to fetal risk .Thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenic properties ."}

If there is iron deficiency anemia due to bleeding from the GI tract, suspect of GI ulcers or slow bleeding from polyps and precancerous areas will be seen during colonoscopy.Colonoscopy does not aid in the diagnosis of gastritis."}
{"text": "Question: What would cause immunocompromise? \n ### Answer: Myriad factors can contribute to depressed immune function, including chronic illness and nutritional deficiencies . Undeniably, the most common root cause of immunosuppression, however, is immunosuppressive medication. In normal healthy individuals, immunosuppressive medication has immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects that are essential in treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The intended effect of these medications is to suppress an overactive immune system during inflammation to restore immune homeostasis and balance, i.e., the adjustment of overactive T cells, auto-reactive B cells, and overproduction of inflammatory mediators by monocytes/macrophages . In skilled hands, these drugs can be exceptionally effective but, ultimately, they blunt the body\u2019s ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility and lowering the body\u2019s threshold for infection."}
{"text": "Question: Whats Keratosis Pilaris? \n ### Answer: Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a common, benign skin condition that causes small, rough bumps on the skin.

{"text": "Question: Whats a cluster headache? \n ### Answer: A cluster headache is a type of headache that occurs in a group or cluster of people. It is a type of primary headache disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headaches that last for a few weeks, followed by remission periods. The headaches are usually unilateral and are often associated with symptoms such as tearing, congestion, and facial flushing. The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but they are thought to be related to abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-autonomic system. Treatment options for cluster headaches include medications, such as triptans and ergotamines, as well as other therapies, such as behavioral therapy and neurostimulation."}
{"text": "Question: Whats good for muscular pain? \n ### Answer: (Does this pain will go away after a while?) How risky is an NSAID? (How good are NSAIDs in risk reduction, what risks can I face using these medications, and what happens in a chronic condition?) I wonder if there is any kind of a hygiene, self-care cure, and when should I see a doctor? How is my pain evaluated by the doctor and to what extent can medication help me? These were some of the expressed worries and questions that can be handled by machine learning tools. There is a substantial gap between the providing and receiving information about symptoms, diagnostic procedures, treatment modalities, possible complications, and the side effects due to differences in information desires and information reception between health care professionals and customers , particularly in cases with some chronic conditions such as musculoskeletal conditions, the desired information is a serious concern, and the physicians who care for these patients should be expert on communication with their patients . Therefore, enough and appropriate information about treatment prognosis can be a spur for pain relief (placebo effect). However, it is better if the provided information has been produced from the clinical experience without relying on hearsay."}
{"text": "Question: Whats menigitis? \n ### Answer: Meningitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Viral meningitis is often mild, with symptoms that can range from a simple headache to a flu-like illness with a high fever. Bacterial meningitis, in contrast, is a medical emergency that should be diagnosed and treated without delay."}
{"text": "Question: Whats the difference between Valtrex and Acyclovir? \n ### Answer: Both are antiviral medications used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. Valtrex is a prodrug that is converted to acyclovir in the body. Acyclovir is the active ingredient in Valtrex. Both medications are effective in treating herpes simplex virus infections, but Valtrex may have a slightly longer half-life and may be more convenient for patients who require multiple doses per day."}

{"text": "Question: Will the antibiotics prevent the lyme disease from progressing? \n ### Answer: Yes, antibiotics are effective for the prevention of lyme in persons at risk for acquiring the disease. In Europe, antibiotics have also been used to ensure eradication of the bacterium in persons thought to have an early stage of the disease that is limited to the skin. The maximum benefit [JOI ratings about 15\u201325] was obtained when the antibiotics were used within the first few days or weeks after the bite. Antibiotic treatment beyond this time period will have considerably less benefit although the risk of progression to late disease is quite low with or without antibiotic treatment. For example, in a recent study from Sweden, 91 cases of erythema migrans received either oral antibiotics with doxycycline for 10 days (55 patients) or no antibiotic treatment (36 patients). Forty-two percent of the 36 patients in the control group all had complete recovery while there was not a single patient who had severe disease in this group. In contrast, among the 55 patients who were treated the failure rate was 23 percent. In other words the risk was reduced by almost one half by proper treatment. Despite the lack of evidence from the U.S. the general recommendation is that all cases of erythema migrans be treated as soon as possible and with at least doxycycline, 100\u2013200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days. The reason for this recommendation is that although the risks of developing long term lyme disease after erythema migrans are now relatively low, they may rise during the next few years and become higher than is advised in some European recommendations."}

{"text": "Question: would standard urinalysis detect kidney stones? \n ### Answer: Provide examples using the values in Table 1 \u2298 Table 2 to explain how these parameters relate to kidney stones (lit. Stone Diseases: Hypercalciuria Following a crystallization event, calcium oxalate is typically the initial \u201cnidus\u201d. The most common site of deposition is the renal papilla, where no fluid comes into close contact with tubular cells and there is poor solute transport capacity. (Unless deposited in the renal pelvis, calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals that have grown large enough to block the lumen of the renal tubule dissociate within the tubule, resulting in \u201ccalcium nephropathy,\u201d without destroying the tubule until later stages, when the crystal is large enough to physically traverse the cell and disrupt transport or cause epithelial cell death. Stone disease is also fairly uniform in that it grows and is composed of hydroxyapatite. Created by Jason H. Morse, Ph.D. Candidate, Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). Report in a manuscript or prominent quality scientific journalGood assessments of this issue should also explain how crystals of calcium oxalates may dissociate from the embedded area (I couldn\u2019t find out what the embedded area is). It may also be worthwhile to explain pathophysiology of urinary tract infections, i.e., how infection of kidney tissue may begin from a urinary tract infection. Since the crystals are likely formed in the urinary tract, it would be interesting to know if an infection of the kidney tissue should follow a kidney stone infection. (I couldn\u2019t find any information that describes a logical sequence of events on how a urinary tract infection may progress to a kidney tissue infection, especially in the \u2018mild and severe form of kidney tissue infections\u2019 situations). Would the cause of short vs long term baseline urinary tract infections lead to different manifestations of the tissue infection? I mean, if a mild response to a short term UTI (due to less kidney stone detection) eventually stages to a severe kidney tissue infection, they will also likely have a technologically mediated reason to complain of a phenomenon that is associated kidney tissue infections. If this explanation is understandable, it may be worthwhile to try to explain this. If"}
