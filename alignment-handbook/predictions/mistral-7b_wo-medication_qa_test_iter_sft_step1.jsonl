{"text": "Question: how does rivatigmine and otc sleep medicine interact? \n ### Answer: The FDA has approved a new drug for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The drug, called rivastigmine, is a cholinesterase inhibitor that works by blocking the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is important for memory and learning.\n\nRivastigmine is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in over a decade. It is also the first drug to be approved for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe drug is taken orally, and the recommended starting dose is 1.5 mg twice daily. The dose can be increased to 3 mg twice daily if needed.\n\nRivastigmine is not a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it can help to slow the progression of the disease. It is important to note that the drug does not work for everyone, and some people may not see any benefit from taking it.\n\nIf you are considering taking rivastigmine, be sure to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the drug.\n\n## What is the best medicine for Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best medicine for Alzheimer\u2019s will vary depending on the individual\u2019s symptoms and needs. However, there are a number of medications that are commonly used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s, and some of these may be more effective than others for a particular individual.\n\nOne of the most commonly used medications for Alzheimer\u2019s is donepezil, which is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Cholinesterase inhibitors work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help to improve cognitive function. Other cholinesterase inhibitors that are sometimes used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s include rivastigmine and galantamine.\n\nAnother medication that is sometimes used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s is memantine, which is a NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptor antagonists work by blocking the activity of the NMDA receptor, which can help to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThere are also a number of other medications that may be used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s"}

{"text": "Question: does cyclosporine ophthalmic helps for iritis? \n ### Answer: Well, it is the only FDA-approved treatment for Behd\u012bnish disease. Although it contains just one active ingredient, cyclosporyne is the only one utilizing its anti-inflammatory mechanism of action to treat iris cells. The article will also look at whether or not to utilize the medication in Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\n## What is Cyclosporine?\n\nCyclosporine A is a fungal peptide of the cyclic undecapeptide composed of 11 amino acids. It is a versatile molecule that is broadly used in many fields, including immunopharmacology, psychiatry, autoimmune disease, and corneal opacification for molecular biology. For veterinary use, cyclosporine A is used to treat various diseases related to the immune system.\n\nThe Calcineurin/NFAT Signaling Pathway is the general mechanism of action. Calcineurin modulates several inflammatory and proliferation signaling pathways to downregulate NFAT activity, which increases inflammation and enhances nitric oxide production, constricts blood vessels leading to tissue injury and ischemia, and helps cells regain energy production.\n\nCyclosporine appears to inhibit several aspects of SARS-Cov-2 infection by decreasing nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines, platelet aggregation, reduced lymphocytes, and decreased Epstein Barr Virus. In addition, the drug modulates NFAT activation via Calcineurin by downregulating cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Cyclosporine may have anti-viral activities due to these pathways.\n\n## Does Cyclosporine Help Face Inflammation?\n\nThe short answer is no. For instance, a Neuraxial analgesia service for obstetric and gynecologic pain is not associated with this complication when administered via the intravenous route. Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion reduces inflammation associated with acute Keratitis.\n\nCyclosporine ophthalmic is a steroid drug with several moisturizing features for those with dry eye syndrome. Its mechanism is complex and focuses on increasing tear production and promoting corneal preservation. A"}

{"text": "Question: results of stopping terazosin? \n ### Answer: > I recently asked about anzyos, and was told to try lifting while on it and see how it effects my endurance. Well, I tried it twice before I stopped cause I couldn't stand feeling how weak I was with that stuff in my system.\n>\n> Now, I have been working it off my system for a week. I'm gonna keep it out for a while, take a break from the gym, and recover. I'd hate to lose muscle due to this stuff. But, really, I'm almost better off not taking it, since I'm just feeling like GLUT ( no athletic ability ). So, a while ago, I asked what would the side effects be if I stopped taking it.\n>\n> Well, is what I found. I feel great, I feel like I have 3 times the energy i even had on anzyos. So, I guess it kind of lifts your endurance, but not in a very good way. The catch is that you loose most if not all of the endurance you have built up (the intensity you feel when on 1MG or 2 of anzyos) when you stop taking it. It's like when you learned how to run very fast, but have to stop running for a while or you'll have a heart attack, so you don't learn how to run that fast again. First, with regard to anzyos, especially for skinheads on ED, I think it loses its affects after about a month. I don't necessarily think that your endurance from before you started it can be built up again, since if you feel that way while on anzyos, it means something else is going on.

{"text": "Question: how many mg does it take to overdose on oxycodone? \n ### Answer: Oxycodone is a selective opioid agonist, meaning that it binds to specific receptors in the central nervous system to produce its effects. This makes it a very potent and effective medication for treating chronic pain conditions. However, like all medications, there is a risk of overdose associated with its use. The question of how many mg it takes to overdose on oxycodone is an important one to consider if you are taking this medication or are considering taking it.\nIn general, it\u2019s very difficult to give a definitive answer to this question because everyone\u2019s tolerance level and body chemistry is different. However, we can give some general guidelines based on our experience working with patients who have taken this medication. First and foremost, it\u2019s important to remember that taking more than the prescribed amount of any medication can increase your risk of overdose.\nGenerally speaking, it\u2019s recommended that people taking oxycodone take between 5-10mg per dose throughout the day, depending on their specific needs and tolerance level. It\u2019s also important to only take the medication as directed by your doctor or pharmacist; taking more than what is prescribed can increase your risk of overdosing on oxycodone.\nIt\u2019s also important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of an oxycodone overdose. These can include feelings of euphoria or extreme relaxation, slurred speech, confusion, dizzy spells or fainting spells, shallow breathing or slowed heart rate, keyed muscles or tremors, vomiting or loss of consciousness. If you experience any of these symptoms after taking oxycodone, seek medical help immediately!\nTaking too much oxycodone can be very dangerous and even deadly if left untreated so it\u2019s important always take this medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor or pharmacist in order to avoid any potential complications related to overdose. If at any point during your treatment with oxycodone you have any concerns about overdosing on the medication then speak with your healthcare provider for advice on how best proceed forward with your treatment plan!\nSide Effects Of Oxycodone Overdose:-\nOxycodone is a powerful opioid analgesic associated with common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation and drowsiness.

{"text": "Question: is it safe to add peppermint essential oil in \"mouth wash?\"? \n ### Answer: I made a healing salve for tooth sensitive teeth before, after i put a drop of peppermint essential oil, and i felt really refreshing in my mouth after using this salve. But here is the question:\nDoes this peppermint oil (and maybe other oils added in salve) do any harm to the outer membrane of my mouth?\nI feel a little uneasy and skeptical to put peppermint oil directly in my mouth. So i thought i better ask, is it safe?\n\nregards Kendy\n\nI expect that it is still safe. The MSDS for a particular molecule does not account for how the molecule behaves when blended with anything else; it is only designed to represent those aspects of the molecule's chemistry which are relevant to its interaction with biology.\n\nThe OSHA code for a similar molecule (mostly because they share the same base identity) is somewhat reassuring in that it states:\n\nCode 5A.5: This chemical substance demonstrates an additional low acute oral toxicity. Thus, an oral toxicity code (ex: 5A.1) is added.\n\nThis is followed up with a '1', indicating that the LD50 of this compound (this, basically, is how toxic the compound is) is between 1-5 g/kg in rats. While not the most relevant, this is at least a code for \"not-super-toxic\", which helps me feel a bit more comfortable.\nThe range is thought to be around 1-3 mg/kg in humans. There is also mention of a dose of up to 20 mg/kg (2-3 ml) having no effect on rats in a three month toxicological study."}

{"text": "Question: what does spironolactone 25 mg pill look like? \n ### Answer: # What Does Levothroid Look Like?\n\nAlthough the size and shape of medications can vary depending on the brand, Levothroid comes in an instant-release white tablet imprinted with 0-737 with 125 micrograms of levothyroxine every pill. The potency of this drug is very mild, which makes it highly suitable for children and those with mild hypothyroidism.\n\n### Does Levothroid come in capsules?\n\nNo, Levothroid comes in instant-release tablets, whereas hypothyroidism medications like Synthroid come in oblong white capsules. The mechanism of these capsule medications is similar to the tablets, even if they look disparate.\n\n### What is Levothroid used for?\n\nCommonly, Levothroid is used to treat mild-to-moderate hypothyroidism through electronic attempts at boosting the thyroid gland to produce enough hormone on its own. Although this medication is not a replacement for the thyroid hormone, it does help tell the body that it has enough and enough is not needed. Levothyroxine is the principle hormone within this drug, and it replaces this hormone via the body being provided and stimulated.\n\n### Levothroid and Drug Interactions\n\nThere are ways to interact with medications other than imbalances in individual drugs, and these involve the affects and dangers of interacting with other substances in your body. For example, Aciphex works best when taken before breakfast, to allow for maximum medication absorption before the body has time to absorb any other medications that feed interactions. In this case, Iron should not be taken within an hour of Aciphex being taken. Similarly, Levothroid cannot interact with Propranolol, another factor that tells the body it has no shortage of hormones of any type. When these two drugs interact with one another, the individual will overproduce hormones.\n\nHyperthyroidism can also occur as other medications intercept with Levothroid. The glucocorticoid hormone family \u201cmight\u201d interact with this medicine, which means you should notify your doctor to eliminate any chances of hyperthyroidism and hypertension. Other hypertension medications can also increase chances of hyperthyroidism, which is why you should rule out the possibility.\n\n### What is Lev"}

{"text": "Question: do i take a statin with or without food \"?\"? \n ### Answer: With food. You are more likely to have an upset stomach if you take it on an empty stomach.\n\nIf you happen to take it on an empty stomach and have this reaction, DO NOT PANIC! You are not having a serious reaction. It's just gastritis.\n\nAlso these are the easiest meds in the buffet to get down, especially if you take them too large doses. They bother some people so drink lots of water with them. Water has two benefits. It helps get the pill down and any coated med like statins, it prevents an upset stomach.\n\nSide effects include an upset stomach. I find this medicine hard to get down. No upset stomach just bloating and poor stomach ups end.\n\nHello,\n\nWhether or not you take a statin on an empty stomach depends on what statin you are taking. Some have to be taken on an empty stomach and others must be taken with food as they can breakdown the food in the stomach and cause diarrhea and gas.\n\nStatins should be taken for a minimum of 7 days before studying their effectiveness. Every statin is different though. Some need to be started at a low dose, then increased, and others can be started at full strength.\n\nHTH!"}

{"text": "Question: do antibiotics like keflex continue working after cessation of drug ?\n? \n ### Answer: No, no matter how much time passes after the antibiotic is discontinued, the antibiotic will cease to work. Medicine does not pass to a lower potency with time. However, nearly all bacterial infections will get better even if they were not treated effectively. Therefore, on occasion a patient will get better even though the antibiotic may have begun working after it was given. This is possible because certain bacteria will die because their host is no longer alive. Others may die because they are resistant to the antibiotic. Others may just be cured spontaneously because of an as yet undefined healing process associated with Koch\u2019s premise of the continuum among the well and the ill."}

{"text": "Question: pain medication how to use? \n ### Answer: The term opioid addiction implies a person having spent significant time ingesting, smoking, injecting, sniffing, or otherwise consuming opioids frequently within the same time frame. It could be two hours or more per day. The amount of time spent in the addiction cycle will vary, but the pattern of cyclical consumption will generally remain the same; this characteristic marks the true addict. However well a person can control the drug intoxication, and however well she can deny she has a real problem, there will inevitably come a time when it will become utterly impossible to deny the addiction.\n\nThe dose of medication may have to be decreased while the patient is developing tolerance because tolerance will increase the dose requirement of the patient. But as time goes by, even the tolerance dose begins to produce painful withdrawal symptoms commonly called drug-dependent withdrawal or drug sickness.\n\nThe depressant effects of narcotic medications work on the entire central nervous system (CNS). The CNS strictly regulates pain sensitivity and mood. Occasionally, abusers seek to increase their intoxication by combining a depressant drug with a stimulant like methamphetamine, coca, or cocaine. Opioids often stand alone in the class of drugs called depressants, Central Nervous System depressants usually slow down heart rhythm and respirations. These depressive effects are most profound when large doses of depressant medications are consumed. The depressive effect on the brain\u2019s appetite regulators can bring about the behaviors cited above. For instance, beer the mildly intoxicating drug, like wine, has shown sales increase of 14 percent on an annual basis. Whether or not the increasing addictiveness of opiates is responsible for increasing beer sales, there is no doubt that certain other antidepressants are the most prescribed drugs for depression and anxiety. On a percentage basis, these medications make up about 17 percent of all medically used drugs. The pain medication market trends watcher has also helped break ground in the design of OxyContin analgesic tablets. Oxycontin, made by Purdue Pharma and currently the most popularly used opioid, represents a system to treat addictive pain patterns. Moreover, Internet sales of opioid medications have skyrocketed as well.\n\nThe purpose of treating with the drugs within the opioid marketplace is seemingly twofold. First, most patients use"}
{"text": "Question: freezing clotrimazole? \n ### Answer: Clotrimazole oral tablets are used to treat several fungal infections, including fungal nail infections. Clotrimazole belongs to the antifungal class of medications. The two most common nail fungal infections are athletes\u2019 foot (tinea pedis) and ringworm (tinea corporis). Occasionally, people with athletes\u2019 foot or ringworms further develop the infection so that it affects the nail, so it needs separate treatment. In other cases, people may have had nail fungus all along. While athletes\u2019 foot or hair ringworm can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams or medicines, these can\u2019t otherwise be used to treat nail fungus.\n\nDo not use clotrimazole oral tablets longer than prescribed by your doctor because this antibiotic may stop working. They can also help prevent infection when given as a prophylaxis. This means taking an antibiotic before being exposed to a possible infection instead of afterward.\n\nEven in its first forms, clotrimazole has regularly shown clinical effectiveness against a wide range of yeast and dermatophyte infections. When applied topically, clotrimazole is effective against Aspergillus, Candida, Malassezia, and dermatophyte infections. This broad spectrum of activity is attributable to both its low pKa value and its high lipophilicity, which enables it to overcome both the outer membrane and the low lipophilicity of the fungal membrane. Discordantly, the related molecules bifonazole econazole are not effective against dermatophytes owing to their weak fungistatic properties[14]. One 2003 study by one of the company\u2019s primary founders, Dr. Mike Wan, demonstrated that clotrimazole cream combined with other kinds of commercial antifungals was able to cure nail fungus with a \u201c100% success rate\u201d after four months of treatment. However, Dr. Wan \u2019s data was gathered in house, so it\u2019s not peer-reviewed, which gives us less confidence in the results.

{"text": "Question: how to combine dapaliflozin with metformin\n? \n ### Answer: 1043 accredited users gave their opinion\n\nMetformin assuages plasma sugar in the people that suffer from type II diabetes mellitus. Within the same group of people that suffer from type II diabetes, it usually becomes necessary at some point, to elevate the antidiabetic doses. In this regard, metformin combined with dapagliflozin can be of interest. This is the first study of clinical trials conducted on the combined effect of metformin and dapagliflozin.\n\nType II diabetes (T2D) is seen more often within a group i.e. obese because obesity in itself is a factor of precursor for diabetes. The precursors are essential in bringing about the disease into action. Among the factors that brought about the diabetes can be spoken about the genetic predisposition and also the change in certain metabolisms i.e., modified activity of various hormones. Metformin is a common drug, known to have a great impact on such conditions like obesity and the management of diabetes. This slow-acting drug is working by improving sensitivity to insulin and inhibiting the absorption of carbohydrates in the body. It is very important to know how to take metformin.\n\nThe means to achieve glucose management, and therefore the diabetes by metformin combined with dapagliflozin started a few years ago in the United States. This is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetes in cases in which the treatment with metformin does not give a good result.\n\nApproximately every third person suffers from diabetes. Like type I diabetes patients, patients with type II diabetes (T2D) need therapeutic management on a daily basis, and over the past decade, the treatment with metformin alone has had the same efficacy, and over the past decade has been used in most diabetics patients.\n\nAlthough the commonly used medicines affect the glucose disposal in the body, decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract and improve insulin sensitivity, over the last few years, these medicines have made substantial changes in management strategies to target new pathogenic mechanisms and achieve better blood sugar homeostasis in patients affected by type II diabetes.\n\nDapagliflozin is another new and promising medicine used for the treatment"}

A lot of people are feeling this way around COPD and many of the pain med are also addictive.\n\nI have inflammation and the first indication is bumpy legs ( pain and pressure ). That is caused by a build up of fibers under the skin. Also look for unusual feedback from the skin where the skin is pinched or bent by the body. Those fibers put pressure on the nerves which is felt as pain. The swelling of the veins is a sign of inflammation. Do you have a tonsil? They are not curable.\n\nYou may have a litany of symptoms and you wonder if they can be cured. The answer is yes!\n\n## Can You Take Spicy Stuff With Advil?\n\nAn over the counter painkiller such as aspirin or anything over-the-counter is not recognized by your body as a drug which means it is ineffective. That is the reason it does not carry the same side effects, as prescription painkillers and that is the reason aspirin is not recognized by your body as medication.\n\nAn aspirin loses its effectiveness from half an hour to a day and a half. Aspirin is very well absorbed by the body, is in direct contact with the blood and diffuses slowly into the body.\n\nAspirin on its own causes one of the most dangerous side effects: irregular heart beating. Irregular heartbeating changes the way your heart fluctuates and can cause cogs, spots and other trouble. With a prescription painkiller the sudden change in the heartbeat could cause something like pregnancy. With aspirin the irregular heartbeat can cause maternal bleeding and a miscarriage.\n\nThe reason aspirin is not recognized as medication is because it does not require the body to absorb it.

However, it cannot quantitate drug concentrations in urine. What hospital so far has these highly confirmed devices? Quantitative assays can be used to ascertain the quantity of a substance in biological products by accurately measuring physicochemical characteristics of that product.\n\nMore specifically, quantitative assays focus on the detection of whether drugs are above, below or in therapeutic levels. It is done by way of comparing a subject\u2019s drug metabolite concentrations to an established reference range. You can measure a particle\u2019s mass, the energy it radiates, or its fluorescence properties, all of which can be correlated with the presence of an analyte.\n\nTriple Quadrupole LC/MS/MS instruments are often utilized to do quantitative drug assays. Each fluctuation with every quadrupole is set for specific molecular parameters like mass-to-chargeratio, ionic charge state (or chargespecies typically exemplified by +1, +2 or + 3 charge), and ability to elongate or contract and transform molecular structure.\nThe first quadrupole (Q1) is packed with small gas particles. By decomposing an analyte into peptide fragments, its mass can be identified. As gas particles can only move inside this quadrupole in a linear fashion, fractions can be efficiently selected or rejected.\nThe widened ion species.\nQ2 is a radio-frequency quadrupole. Its mass spectrum is broader and not precisely calculated. The result is most ions in the analyte are molecularly present. Substances of interest which pass the Q1 filter are injected into a collision cell, where they are fragmented. This allows the product ions to have a different identity from the original substance.\nThe third quadrupole (Q3) is identical in functionality to the second quadrupole (Q2) and allows the restriction of these product ions to some desired mass-to-charge ratio. Now, an analyte as a whole can be identified by its own product ion\u2019s mass-to-charge ratioand a single compound can be given a unique identification.\nAttachable elements increase sensitivity and specificity.\nA wide variety of analytical methods can be"}

{"text": "Question: age limits for use of bupropion? \n ### Answer: Avoid use in children, hard to say what the limits should be.\n\nADHD\n\nIn studies over the past decade, bupropion has been found to improve ADHD exclusively in children and adolescents with hyperactivity and impulsivity -- children with the inattentive type of ADHD did not respond. Still, the most common bad effects are insomnia and anorexia, which can only aggravate hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nAny risk of seizure must be weighed against this. There is a lot of conflicting evidence on sertraline, but keep in mind that paradoxical stimulation is a relatively frequent reaction to SSRIs in any age group, so perhaps don't do both together. Remain wary of using sertraline even in young adults. Bupropion is a fat-soluble tertiary amine, not an SSRI. No good clinical trials have been done with its use in hyperactivity.

{"text": "Question: what is aldosterone? \n ### Answer: Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, located just above the kidneys. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones that are essential for the production of blood cells, the regulation of salt and potassium levels, and the response to stress among other things. Most aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa, which in turn creates other compounds called adrenocortical steroids.\n\nWhat does aldosterone do?\n\nAldosterone is essential for the maintenance of electrolyte balance. Electrolytes are ions (particles with a positive or negative charge) that, when excreted, regulate the effects of other substances in the body. Aldosterone serves to retain sodium and excrete potassium, or vice versa. A lack of aldosterone can lead to death from dehydration.\n\nHigh levels of aldosterone in the blood can potentially lead to heart failure, as it allows for an increase in blood volume.\n\nWhat conditions or diseases are linked to high levels of aldosterone?\n\nToo much aldosterone in the blood can be created by a neurological disorder called Cushing\u2019s Striatum Dysphoria. This disorder may also be confirm to aortic aneurisms and thoracic disorders.\n\nLow levels of aldosterone may be caused by adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease."}

However, symptoms get better (weak cough, exhaustion and other things) after 2 puffs of ProAir. So I wonder how much is contained in each puff. Of course, ask your doctor. But as I understand, 2 puffs of Advair means 44 micrograms of fluticasone and 220 micrograms of salmeterol xinafoate. My inhaler of ProAir isn't approved for COPD. Which formula can I use for ProAir? It's 160 micrograms/metered dose. It's ProAir HFA - 4.5 mg. So, it's 100 micrograms per puff.

{"text": "Question: ink 2.3 how much coumadine should one take? \n ### Answer: Depends on the indications for anticoagulation: how severe is your condition and what is your goal.  The big three are to prevent clotting, potentiate the fibrinolytic (dissolving) system, and then tighten up the capillaries from leaking (Klingor rule).  Coumadin will lower INR via protein changes, which will trigger an increase via reflex secretion. Coopers study review laid out the right right combo data on prov this.  Were still figuring that out today with FactorVa trial.\n\n- Coumadin has lots of risks and complications worth reviewing, including portal failure, rupture, necrosis, hemorrhage, and death.  If youre not an expert at how to manage it, you should see someone who is.\n- The dose is based on how much your proteins are altered, just as the gauging of blood sugar is the rate at which your cells absorb or produce it.  Just because a certain number forces a revolution in one body doesnt mean it will do so in yours.\n- Fed state is measured at a different time and will coincide with Dec.\n- Your theresponse to anticoagulative drugs depends on your current state of health, also coupled to nutritional support (elevated lipid being one reason it might not work). Ive made the point before that the numbers we deal with are that of the physicians office visit, but are much smaller than the number of anticoagulants passed into the circulation in terms of the data gathered from arteruit blood draw vs NPO lab report. The ok cases normally adress this issue by taking on additional risk: multiple injections, increased drug usage at OD or above its saturation point, etc.\n- Your max amount above nutritional need in the intervening period permits you to take the max dose at a minimum.  Both D-RNA* and the gem issue here are multiple doses, so i worked with a very small amount over the period of time from morning to lunch, when id read it as ok in The Average Dose Report (DDay). You should land on the max amount nine times through you higher vivo data levels: youre nearly at peak risk, so its important to see the data from first thing in libe to afternoon, and that are calculated at the periods"}

{"text": "Question: how does spiriva work? \n ### Answer: The active ingredient in Spiriva is called tiotropium bromide. This is a form of muscarinic agonist which is a substance that works with the muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system.oxitropium bromide are known to reduce activity in groups of neurons in the brain and muscle cells, which is what ultimately helps those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) breathe better and slow down the decline of their disease.\n\nTiotropium bromide is a type of anticholinergic drug, which means it indirectly blocks different types of receptors in the body. In the muscarinic part of the brain, it works to inhibit the neurons by binding to calcium channels in muscle and connective tissue. These anticholinergic drugs are also used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nSpiriva comes in the form of inhalation capsules to be inserted into a Spiriva HandiHaler. It comes in two main dosages to fit the needs of the individual patient. This medication is usually taken about once a day due to its long-lasting effects, which makes it easier for the patient to remember. It can take up to several weeks before the patient starts to see noticeable results.\n\n## Side Effects\n\nSpiriva j indigestion causes a significant number of serious side effects, which is why it\u2019s important to understand this before you decide to use it as a treatment for your COPD.\n\n- Asthma Bronchospasm: Simply stated, this means that for some patients with asthma, Spiriva can trigger an asthma attack. If a patient suffers from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the doctor will not prescribe Spiriva for the COPD, unless it is a better choice than other medications.\n- Allergy: Spiriva can cause throat irritation, nose and throat swelling (laryngospasm), nausea, vomiting, and itchy skin reactions.\n- Increased Urinary Tract Infection Risk: Using Spiriva can increase the risk that the patient will develop urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis.\n- Gastrointestinal: Patients using Sp"}
{"text": "Question: norvasc and depression? \n ### Answer: - A connection between anxiety and heartburn has not been made.\n- Many anxiety patients suffer from heartburn, and anxiety can increase the severity of these gut related symptoms.\n- The anxiety should decrease regardless, but remember that it may take a while for all your anxiety symptoms to subside, and often the physical symptoms are the last to go.\n\nThe same applies here as it does for stomach-related symptoms - discomfort from heartburn is in itself painful, but the anxiety may worsen the symptoms. If you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), this may play havoc with how your body reacts to any form of tension, irritation, or stress.\n\nPart of being anxious may include the way your body reacts to anxiety at any time, particularly when it comes to stomach or digestive problems, but this may be heightened by the negative thoughts around anxiety. A few things to note here:\n\n- It's possible for anxiety to worsen symptoms of heartburn, so controlling your anxiety can help relieve your heartburn.\n- For anyone that is free of heartburn, anxiety can make you overly sensitive, susceptible to problems related to the digestive tract. Anxiety may hence increase the chance of developing heartburn as well, or make that one irritable bout of heartburn feel so much worse.\n- Anxiety, and the stress it brings, can cause heartburn for different reasons. It might provoke the release of extra gastric acid or calcium, alter the way the stomach contracts, and lead to greater sensational pain!\n- However, only periods of long-term anxiety are known to have an effect on heartburn. So, it's not anxiety, but stress. By controlling your anxiety and ensuring your heartburn doesn't turn into long-lasting acid reflux, you may be able to control and even experience relief from your heartburn symptoms.\n- Just like with irritable bowel syndrome, or other physical symptoms, anxiety has a way of conspiring and generating what is called \"anxious attribution\". By that I mean, the anxious person may start interpreting mild burps or hiccups as clear indications of ominous and frightening illness, which is not at all helpful.\n- We're withdrawing from other people. We don't like the way we look. We don't feel confident"}

Three vaccines are given at ages 6, 18, and 12\u201318 months. In general, children who received the DTaP vaccine in the past will require DTaP replacement vaccinations at ages 4 and 6 years (you can also get the Tdap vaccine as part of the pre-adolescent series). The alternative to this is the booster, which updates the vaccine every 5 years. It is most essential to use if you were instantly exposed to whooping cough bacteria. Additionally, the vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before exposure to the bacterium. The DLT or IHL will be given to your child if he suffers an adverse reaction to the medication. An annual booster shot for pertussis is recommended by the AAP to prevent the spread of infections in schools. There are two vaccines used for pertussis prevention: the childhood pertussis vaccine and the adult pertussis booster vaccine, or both, and these protect your child against pertussis (whooping cough). Your child should also get the pertussis vaccine when he or she goes to the pediatrician. If you were exposed to whooping cough bacteria within the last two weeks, you can protect yourself by getting a pertussis vaccination. The DTaP vaccine is required for all children entering daycare or school, according to Oregon law. In close contact with the disease, adults who receive the vaccine or Tdap booster shot are the only people who should be given the vaccine. Although it is rare, it is always worthwhile to prevent an infection by getting one more DTaP shot.\n\n## Tdap (H-167)\n\nA single immunization against whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is required.\n\nIf you are over the age"}

However, it is important to note that these products should not be used with other over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications without first consulting with a healthcare professional.\n\nMucinex Fast-Max products contain guaifenesin, an expectorant that helps to thin and loosen mucus in the lungs and airways. This can be beneficial for individuals with cough and congestion caused by a cold, flu, or other respiratory infection. However, guaifenesin can also interact with other medications, including some OTC and prescription drugs.\n\nFor example, guaifenesin can interact with certain antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), which can cause drowsiness and other side effects. It can also interact with certain blood pressure medications, such as beta-blockers, which can cause a drop in blood pressure.\n\nIn addition, guaifenesin can interact with certain antibiotics, such as tetracycline and doxycycline, which can reduce the effectiveness of the antibiotic. It can also interact with certain antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can cause an increase in side effects.\n\nIt is important to note that Mucinex Fast-Max products should not be used with other medications that contain guaifenesin, as this can lead to an overdose of the drug.\n\nIn conclusion, Mucinex Fast-Max products should not be used with other OTC or prescription medications without first consulting with a healthcare professional.

{"text": "Question: how to stop taking buprenorphine? \n ### Answer: The first thing to know is that Buprenorphine should never be stopped suddenly. Buprenorphine addiction recovery programs require that you first consult with your doctor before terminating the medication.\n\nA tappering schedule should be determined, along with a schedule for counseling sessions to be completed to support your recovery. Never attempt to discontinue the medicine on your own.\n\nThe most effective way to halt a buprenorphine treatment is through proper tapering.\n\nTo stop using buprenorphine through medical evaluation with those who are addicted is crucial. Tapering also helps reduce withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, pain, difficulty sleeping, and nausea.\n\n## How to stop taking buprenorphine?\n\nIf you have suffered from addiction to opioids for some time, stopping the drugs abruptly can result in withdrawal symptoms that can be harsh. In this case, a specialist can help you stop using the drugs by tapering intead of stopping abruptly. There are also addiction support groups that can help you reduce dependence on opioids or other prescription drugs.\n\nTapering refers to gradually reducing your dose to help lessen the body\u2019s dependence on the substance. In this kind of scenario that is gradual tapering, medication is reduced day by day, until it is eventually eliminated. It is important to keep in mind that failing to reduce your dose over the course of time is not likely to eliminate your withdrawal symptoms. In this case you\u2019ll require medical assistance.\n\nAnother option to help with withdrawal symptoms of prescription drugs is using anti-addiction medication like Clonidine, which is sometimes used in conjunction with the Suboxone (Subutex). This drug is administered orally or through sublingual tabs. It takes about two different processes to get rid of the drug. They are medically-prepared decompression and maintenance with long-term abstinence.\n\nMedically supervised decompression and maintenance with long-term abstinence may involve three phases:\n\nMedically-prepared decompression and maintenance with long-term abstinence\n\nA medical professional must supervise medically-prepared decompression.\n\nParticipants are unable to recover spontaneously at home.

{"text": "Question: fentanyl \"patch,\" what if \"doesn't\" stick well\n? \n ### Answer: Patches can lose their effectiveness if they separate from your skin or are damaged. To help prevent this from happening, we recommend the following steps:\n\n-Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the skin where the patch will be tucked in. This will protect the edges of the patch.\n-Avoid dressing over the patch unless it is an absolutely necessary medical application, e.g., therapeutic dressings, tape, splints. A dressing will subsequently increase the temperature around the patch and may cause the skin barrier to come from the skin surface.\n-Wipe the skin surface gently with soap and water to remove oils after a bath, shower or swimming pool.\n-Do not fold the patch when you change it. Discard the used patch properly and promptly.\n-Check if the patch is still in place a few times a day and after showering, bathing, partially removing clothing or exertion.\n-Apply the patch to a different spot of skin (below the neck or on the sides of the arms and legs) on days you replace the patch to reduce the likelihood of irritation or skin breakdown."}

For the most part, legal limitations exist between countries, with some states allowing you to smoke weed or buy marijuana-infused products from a store. Recent studies have discovered that the uptake of THC from herbal marijuana extracts can last more than ten days after inhaling the drug. However, if you consume drugs, it won\u2019t"}

{"text": "Question: what medications contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver? \n ### Answer: Certain medications have been associated with an increased risk of fatty liver. These include some drugs used to treat high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as some medications used for diabetes.\n\nSome of the medications that are most associated with an increased risk of fatty liver are beta-blockers, which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure; statins, which are commonly used to lower cholesterol levels; metformin, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes; and diuretics, which are medications that help to remove excess fluid from the body. Heavy alcohol use and obesity can also contribute to the development of fatty liver.\n\nFatty liver disease is a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver and can lead to inflammation and damage to the organ. In people who drink too much alcohol, this accumulation of fat can contribute to the development of an alcoholic liver disease. In people who do not drink, the accumulation of fat in the liver is called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.\n\nNon-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) can occur in people who drink heavy amounts of alcohol over a short period of time. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD).\n\nNAFLD is the most common liver disorder in the United States. It is estimated that 10 to 30 percent of the U.S. population has NAFLD.\n\nWhat causes NAFLD?\n\nThe causes of NAFLD are unknown, but certain conditions can increase the risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\n\u25a0 Obesity\n\u25a0 Type 2 diabetes\n\u25a0 High blood pressure\n\u25a0 High cholesterol\n\u25a0 Sedentary lifestyle\n\u25a0 Smoking\n\u25a0 Family history of NAFLD\n\nHow is NAFLD diagnosed?\n\nNAFLD is typically diagnosed during a physical exam, a review of personal and family medical history, and blood work. Imaging studies may also be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or liver biopsy may be done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of NAFLD?\n\nMost people do not have any symptoms of NAFLD. When symptoms do occur, they may include:\n\n\u25a0 Fatigue\n\u25a0 Weakness"}

{"text": "Question: shingles vaccine , is it necessary to get a 2nd shot? \n ### Answer: , shingles vaccination, shingles vaccine booster, Shingrix, vaccination for shingles virus in india, shingrix second dose, shingles vaccine 2nd shot,\n\n# shingles vaccine , is it necessary to get a 2nd shot?\n\n### Shingles vaccine: Is it necessary to get a second shot?\n\nLast Updated 4 Days Ago\nShingles vaccination is effective. But there is some confusion regarding the duration for which it remains effective. Up to 100 shingles doses have been added nationwide since March a year ago. A second shot of that vaccine is typically recommended for individuals 65 and older, even if they already had a shingles shot about five to 10 years before, the CDC affirms.\n\nThat recommendation won praise from specialists, who said they expected the coverage period of the original shot may not be long enough to get the complete benefit of new shingles vaccination.\n\n\"I was delighted to see they came out with booster messages. The initial vaccine will not give long-term protection,\" said Heather Hadley, PhD, associate teacher of neurology at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Ray Hogan Doctor of Medicine, scientist and vice-president and head of research and development life sciences for Alvotech, a biopharmaceutical company.\n\n\"Many people still get shingles years after prevention,\" said Hadley.\n\nThe newest shingles vaccine, designed Shingrix, is up to 97% effective in preventing shingles and skin diseases, such as post-herpetic neuralgia (paroxysmal neuralgia), doctor says. But people over 70 received antiherpetic immunity from before the vaccine is used and those 70 and older are the patients at the highest risk for severe skin rashes.\n\nShingrix Reimburses patients for $110 each, up to three days to protect against shingles and associated side effects. Some insurance providers cover the total amount of this vaccination.\n\n### Shingles Virus In Elderly India\n\nAt the Wake Forest School of Medicine, for instance, shingles is a severe concern among people over 65. Yet, we usually do not get to that herd. We need extra protection."}
{"text": "Question: shingles vaccine , is it necessary to get a 2nd shot? \n ### Answer: what are your thoughts? it sounds like there are 2 popular shingles vaccines...shingrix and zostavax. are two options different?\n\nshould one get the same type of vaccine 4 years later along again, or is the vaccine different each time?\n\nShingrix is the newest vaccine and requires two doses 2 to 6 months apart. If you are over 50, you may have already received Zostavax, the previous generation vaccine, in the past. Check your vaccination records to see if you have previously gotten this vaccine for shingles. If there is no record, then it is likely you have not had it. It's too big of a virus dose for them to forget about. Also, there should be a medical record as well. Now is a good time to see your doctor for a wellness check-up. If you have had the single Zostavax, ask your doctor if she will order a blood test to confirm before giving the Shingrix vaccine booster (second dose). Treat the shingles vaccine as an important, life-saving prescription medication. Doctors are also sent monthly emails with what the recommended immunization schedule is for you. This may or may not contain a written prescription information that direct admission to a state wide public health department portal. If you do get some unnecessary vaccine or if you get Zostavax and then Shingrix too soon, there is a line to submit adverse reactions. If you cannot find your record, then get a current copy of your record to see if you have already gotten vaccinated. The Kaiser vaccine portal is also available for Kaiser Permanente members and may have the CDC's current recommended preventative vaccine information available. Remember, errors can still be made and many health care facilities may not even know about the process to check."}

The primary metabolite of levodopa is carbidopa which has a half-life of about 6 hours. However, it does not accumulate in the body because it is excreted through the kidneys. The other metabolites of levodopa, such as dopamine and homovanillic acid, also have half-lives of a few hours but they can accumulate in the body.

{"text": "Question: blood thinner pills how to use them safely\n? \n ### Answer: https://tinnitus.o-t-d.com/blood-thinner-pills-how-to-use-them-safely/\nAnticoagulants, or \u201cblood thinners,\u201d are drugs that help prevent blood clots. They reduce the risk of stroke in people with irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation), heart valve disorders, and similar conditions.\n\nBut taking blood thinners \u2014 such as warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) and Pradaxa \u2014 can lead to unpredictable and sometimes serious bleeding, and other side effects. To make sure you stay healthy and avoid serious complications, it\u2019s important to take your medication exactly how your doctor prescribes.\nBeing aware of what can offset your blood thinner\u2019s effectiveness and increase the risk of bleeding is just as important.\nWarfarin is usually recommended for people at particularly high risk for stroke. It\u2019s inexpensive and effective, and its effects can be monitored with regular blood tests. Anticoagulants Pradaxa and Eliquis are newer. Eliquis lasts in the body the shortest time of the three drugs.\nPeople who take warfarin, Eliquis, or Pradaxa should know when to take the medication, how much to take, and which foods and beverages aren\u2019t safe to consume while taking these blood thinners.\nDiet and Blood Thinners\nYour diet is an important aspect of your treatment plan while taking a blood thinner. Many foods \u2014 and some beverages \u2014 can either boost the effects of a blood thinner or offset those effects.\nFor instance, certain doses of warfarin are affected by high-calorie, low-protein diets, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Low-sodium diets also seem to interfere with the effects of warfarin.\nThe NIH notes that some evidence points to a relationship between warfarin and folic acid, a vitamin normally found in dark, green vegetables, citrus fruits, nuts, and beans. The NIH believes folic acid might reduce the blood-clotting capabilities of warfarin, but that more research is needed.\nChanges to your diet while taking a blood thinner are another reason to regularly see your doctor.

The reason is that he or she will understand the doctrine, the reasoning, and will be able to explain the reasoning behind the assessment. A person who has not done any research at all will think you are crazy just because you read about something on a website, magazine, or newspaper. To test the mental ability of such a person, you just tell him or her that a certain dated item can be used by a person with the agl01 research paper first idea of drugs.\n\nDo not try to use the medicine beforehand; just wait for the expiration date to pass. You also need to watch your language so that people will not fear you or think you are crazy by interpreting your statements in a certain way.\n\nIf the expiration date has passed, be sure not to give the medicine into the skin. You also need to be patient, because you may need to wait until a few days have gone by. There is a scientific explanation for this: the medicine is said to be absorbed through the skin; however, it cannot be absorbed into the body unless there is fat where the medicine can be stored. The more fat storage, the greater the possibility for absorption; but on the other hand, if you have too much fat, the polymerases will just give the medicine back to the membrane, and not absorb it. Therefore, do not give the medicine into your skin; however, it is safe to put a film on your skin so that the medicine can absorb through that.\n\nThe agl01 blessing research paper pdf should be used on your skin. However, the study concludes that the use of these cells is not the first time that cells in the body have been given to people for medical use, and the study did not say anything about the meaning of the term.\n\nWe know why the cells can stay inside a small skin patch, but we do not know how to distinguish between the cells inside the patch and the cells in other parts of the body.

The question of drug interactions is tough.\n\nSince medications are administered to the body and are thus introduced into the body, they will influence the body and there will be processes taking place in the body from taking the meds.\n\nWhile many place high stakes reps on the warnings given by pharmacists and physicians and statisticians when they tell of potential drug interactions, the fact of the matter is that every single drug we take has the potential to interfere with another we take. This is because there is no drug that is taken that is without some kind of active or passive reagent that doesnt in some way or another interfere with pharmacological agents taken alongside it.\n\nThe deeper sources of concern are often when it comes to medications in specific classes. For example, antidepressants move quickly through the liver during a process called hepatic metabolism where they have strong affinities towards liver enzymes that are related to oxygen binding at carbon sink covalent bonds through chamical ionic bonds, but moreover it is the uniency chain links of time that are often more in the face of the statistics that are at the forefront of statistics.\n\nIn other words, the fact that anti-depressants can either degrade rapidly or work slowly through losing their strength while using the rapid loss of the medication that they were so quickly administered often at times than the patients who many times take them demonstrated a lose of efficacy of traditional values of medical value reserching is quickly losing the strength of traditional upkeep of values of medical values.\n\nThe more time passes without the patient seeing some kind of effect of relief from illness, the greater the strength of the drugs dissipates.\n\nUnfortunately, the antidepressants that are so frequently prescribed like fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, can render their users with limited options when it comes to what they find useful to take.\n\nA large number of brands of medications work around this.

The raw form.\n\n## How to Inject Pills Morphine\n\nThe morphine in the brain is most effective when it is taken once per day. Morphine is most effective when it is taken in combination with methadone as the two compounds act at different rates. Methadone is commonly used as it produces less toxic byproducts and is absorbed much more rapidly.\n\nBy applying morphine to the area around the eye, the drug can lead to mood swings, irritability and even panic attacks. This process can also lead to skin damage, which can lead to eye irritation. Morphine may also cause headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nTaken too much at once, morphine may cause abdominal pain, muscle spasms and even stroke.\n\nInjecting a small amount on the outer part of the throat may produce pain in the gums and muscles, muscle spasms and nausea. If taken illegally, abusers may not know when they receive their treatment. This can cause them to take doses that are not effective throughout the day. This can put them at risk of a cardiovascular event such as an stroke or seizure.\n\nSo what is the best way to inject morhing into a person? Laxine cracks the surface of the pill with a toothpick and places it on a solid surface like paper, coated plastic labsubstances such as cigarettes, pipe bombs or pipes. Laxine then sprays the pill with a liquid food product, such as red wine, vodka and water, and leaves it to soak in the substance for a few minutes. The pill is then rolled up and placed in the mouth and is then smoked. The bitterness from the alcohol and the cocaine cross the blood-brain barrier. Because crack or cocaine are caffeine stimulants, the body quickly becomes addicted to them.\n\nAn illicit user can take their drugs by toothpick and leave all the debris in the house. Crack"}

It is a type of anti-epileptic medication, which means that it treats seizures. It can also help in the treatment of bipolar disorder, which involves extreme highs and lows.\n\nwhat is divalproex used for and treated?\nTreatment with divalproex sodium may make your child sleepier than they normally are. However, the child\u2019s mood stabilizer may be added to help reduce the risk of having all episodes, episodes of depression, or attempted suicide. Renal disease, heart disease, or liver diseases can make divalproex sodium doxycycline not a safe option for your child. Additionally, divalproex sodium and birth control pills may increase the risk of blood clots or stroke. If your child must be taking birth control pills and divalproex sodium, talk to your doctor. Generally, women more than 35 years of age taking estrogen therapies in someone who smokes are at particularly high risk. In addition, interacting drugs may make divalproex sodium or birth control pills less effective at reducing seizure episodes and low blood clots. Discuss with your child\u2019s doctor to further consider the use of divalproex sodium or birth control pills during pregnancy. Divalproex sodium blocks the activity of GABA. GABA is a brain chemical that is necessary for seizures to occur. By helping GABA increase, divalproex sodium can reduce the risk of seizures. Divalproex sodium has also been found to stabilize the mood of some people. The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood."}
{"text": "Question: what is divalproex? \n ### Answer: Belonging to the family of drugs designated as anticonvulsants, divalproex is used in treating various individuals with epilepsy. It is also one of the drugs of choice for manic episodes characterizing bipolar disorder. Selling costs are significantly low when divalproex is presented to over the counter drug establishments. It is accessible in both oral as well as injectable forms. There have been claims and counter claims on the effectiveness of divalproex.\n\nStudies conducted by expert laboratories indicate prevention of manic states and the onset of further episodes. However, researchers have noted that there are an unidentified number of divalproex side effects. These negative responses to the drug can inhibit its inclusion into the holistic regime of treatment. Drugs are always subjected to review or alteration as far as the treating of afflicted patients is concerned. Various ailments or occurring complications may exacerbate particular health conditions susceptible to even minor drug inflows.\n\nBesides restoring manic patients and the prevention of further episodes, divalproex is fast-acting and effective. Failure for the patient to observe recommended divalproex guidelines may result in the enhanced drugs counter effects. Failure to adequately address the reactions is likely to aggravate the illness. The zero tolerance with the accompanying reactions represents the basis for the control of drugs. Depression and even suicide is attributed to the poor regulating mechanism where complaints may be violent for the patients or their relatives.\n\nMore often than the administrators of these drugs, the controls are carried out by nurses and physicians in the process of diagnosing patient on the adequacy of divalproex. All the secondary factors concerned are likely to compromise the performance at this juncture. Anomalies can present a tendency for the planning and execution of treatment, evaluation of therapy, and even the necessary prescriptions. It is highly recommended to consult the physician in case the divalproex drug side effects become a cause for worry.\n\nThat will eventually let the prescribing physician alter the dosage. These adjustments can either be in the form of time and the drug dosage. Naturally the divalproex side effects information is well known to all patients who have formerly undergone the ordeal of using divalproex. The best remedial structures should capture all the div"}

Ive never took a drug of any kind and i kinda scared.?\n\n?

If you read the package info in its entirety you will find little to no contraindications, and the only list of side effects I could find were headaches, dizziness, rashes, and decreased effectiveness of medications used to control osteoporosis. (I don\u2019t take that, though I might someday, because I am a womanay of a certain age).\n\nNow to your questions\u2026\n\n1) Is 600mg considered a strong dose?\n\nGabapentin is a benign medication in terms of side effects, and you can begin with 300 and increase the drug dosage by 300mg per week.\n\nSo your answer is NO - 600mg currently is not a strong dose. Making a comparison to other meds commonly used to control seizures will be of help to you.

{"text": "Question: what is acetylcholine how does it work? \n ### Answer: A:\n\n## How Does Acetylcholine Work?\n\nAcetylcholine is one of the most important neurotransmitters that exists in the human body. It is produced by the preganglionic and cholinergic neurons in the brain and is the essential neurotransmitter for the formation of muscle and other voluntary function cells. This is the same neurotransmitter that helps to trigger or activate certain responses of the brain and nervous system when people are excited. This is why you may get certain reactions when you are nervous or excited. This may result in you being clumsy or having difficulty completing ordinary tasks such as eating or drinking. The word acetylcholine actually comes from two Greek words which mean to produce choline and is used to describe this feature of the body\u2019s biochemistry.\n\n## Significance\n\nThe significance of acetylcholine is that it is a very important transmitter that helps the body function properly and effectively. By using the power and effectiveness of this neurotransmitter, the brain is able to stimulate or activate a wide array of reactions that occur simultaneously within the body. Due to the way that acetylcholine travels through the chemical reaction of the body, various bodily functions are activated. These include the hormonal storing and releasing aspects of the body, as well as the processing of thoughts and sensations of pain or pleasure. Because this neurotransmitter works very swiftly and effectively, people who have too much or too little of this chemical in their system can experience some very severe consequences. This is why it is crucial to monitor your levels of choline in order to maintain your body\u2019s natural functioning and also reduce the risk of possible further complications."}

{"text": "Question: what is dopamine? \n ### Answer: Dopamine (Prussic acid Dammar Epicatechin) is a hormone and neurotransmitter produced in some parts of the central nervous system (CNS), mainly in the spinal cord. Experiments have shown that dopamine activity precedes stimuli that relate to reward, such as food or sexual behavior. Scientists have repeatedly related dopamine to pleasure, happiness and motivation, among other functions. It has also been shown that it plays a major role in cognitive functioning, including attention, memory and movements. It closes a communication channel between various neurons in the CNS. A leap in action immediately after Dopamine release can occur, which can be triggered problematically by drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine (also known as Ampetamines) or methamphetamine (also referred to as Methamphetamines).\n\nNeurologist release: Greater Dopamine Summary: Dopamine is a hormone and youthful neurotransmitter found in animals. It acts as a neurotransmitter in some parts of the brain. It has also been shown as a transmitter in the adrenal medulla in vertebrates. Dopamine is a hormone and natural neurotransmitter, which is produced in some parts of the brain. It is manufactured by some cells in the brain (neurons), which are essential to good mental health and feeling good, 5,400,000 (23). Dopamine is synthesized within the substantia 1 \u2013 Cells and is converted to prolactin by decarboxylation of chemical reactions within these cells. Dopamine can interact with the central nervous system. It can be quickly broken down by the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase, ubiquinone reductase, or by autoxidation (1). Dopamine has a longer half-life than norepinephrine because the added methyl group of beta-methylaspartyl amino acid outperforms dopamine. Dopamine acts on two types of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2, which are harder to access, and shows slight intrinsic activity (1). Dopamine acts as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. It is released from neurons in the substantia 1 cells (the central area of the limbic system, the so-"}

{"text": "Question: how to reconstitute cefazolin\n? \n ### Answer: Our normal reconstitution is a vial with 150-1500 mg in a 10 mL vial (when it's fluffed up) and 1-10 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride sodium. If you overdraw you can dilute it up to I believe 50-200mg/5 mL.\n\nIf you are dealing with a 500-1000mg vial I find it best to really ball it up at the top with a health care guide to push it in. I still do my usual check of fluffing it up from the top to bottom, but making sure it\u2019s broken up enough. If the vial is broken (yes it\u2019s very difficult to break but does happen) I will grab the C.P.H.I and do a little math to dilute it to the correct concentration.\n\nIf you are doing 500 mg a vial apparently a mix of sterile water and 0.010M (concentrated) of NaOH will make 7 mL of sterile water. If you use lot o #57 sterile water it\u2019s .389 NaOH + 6.4229 g sterile water to make 7 ml. That means you now have the correct amount of NaOH and sterile water but have a total of 7mL not the 5 mL you want. Take away 1.5mL of sterile water to make 150,000 units cefazolin in a total volume of 5 mL (which is the 100,000 units/1 mL.) We always make 150,000 units to ensure we have the correct amount and are using the correct volume per mcx instructions.

{"text": "Question: what pills are not compatible with hydrocodone? \n ### Answer: Hydrocodone is a powerful narcotic pain killer that is ordinarily found in the form of a white powder. Most people take it in conjunction with other medications, and also in combination with other drugs. It\u2019s no wonder that there are so many combinations that are sometimes used. But what happens if someone takes the wrong combination of drugs? It\u2019s not hard to pick out what pills that are not compatible with hydrocodone, because some of them are going to cause major problems. There are many drugs, including hydrocodone, that can have a negative effect when combined with another pharmaceutical. Hydrocodone is one of those prescription drugs. Most likely, any pill combinations that contain this component and another one will lead to disaster. It\u2019s not just the fact that ingestion of these drugs may put you in danger; they can also endanger the wellbeing of those around you. If you take the wrong dose of prescription medication, your body can also experience harm. If you are using prescription drugs, pay close attention when getting your prescriptions filled. Stay away from any medications that contain hydrocodone and other sedatives. Additionally, consult your doctor before beginning any drug regimen. If you are taking any medication containing a narcotic drug, make sure that you thoroughly review your prescriptions. A lot of drug combinations can lead to a lethal outcome.\n\nOne of the most common combination of drugs to use that is not compatible with hydrocodone is prescription antihistamines. It\u2019s generally easy to pick out which one of these you should use. In any case, remember that when you\u2019re taking these medications, it\u2019s crucial that you read the directions carefully.

{"text": "Question: how long will suboxone block opioid? \n ### Answer: There is no definitive answer to this question as the metabolism of suboxone varies from person to person. However, it is generally agreed that suboxone will metabolize opioids for approximately 2-6 hours after ingestion.\n\nThe answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the dosage of suboxone and the individual\u2019s metabolism. Generally speaking, suboxone will block opioid receptors for up to 24 hours.\n\nNo matter how many times you\u2019ve taken Suboxone, the ability of the drug to block opioid receptors rest long after you\u2019ve had your last dose of Suboxone.\n\nabout 6 hours.\n\nCaffeine can not be a helpful supporter in this If you use ibuprofen or aspirin, beginning about six hours before you take Subutex, you pain and Read More \u2026\n\nHow Long Does it take for Suboxone to Metabolize? The metabolism of suboxone varies greatly from person to person and can take anywhere from 2-9 hours.\n\nSuboxone is a prescription medication that is used to treat opioid addiction. While it is not fully clear how long it will take for suboxone to block opioids, it is generally believed that the medication will continue to block opioids for a period of time after the dosing has ended. The length of time that suboxone will continue to block opioids will vary from person to person, and there are a number of factors that can influence this. Some of these factors include how much of the medication is taken, how often it is taken, and whether the medication is taken in combination with other drugs.\n\nHow long Suboxone will block opioid receptors depends on how high the dosage of Suboxone taken was. The higher the dosage, the longer it will take for the block of receptors to weaken. The dosage of Suboxone should not most of the time exceed two mg per day.

{"text": "Question: how to stop taking trazodone? \n ### Answer: Some people take Trazodone sleeping tablets to help them achieve improved and longer sleep. However, long-term use of this drug can have very dangerous effects on your body, if you suddenly stop taking them. You should not stop taking your sleeping drugs before consulting a medical professional. This will allow you to stop your medicine gradually and safely.\n\nPeople who have been taking Trazodone for a long time and are trying to stop taking it should exercise some caution. Various factors like anxiety, depression, or overwhelming feelings can make you want to suddenly stop taking the drug. Or simply forgetting the side effects of using it for a long period of time. These factors can cause you to stop taking it without paying attention to the fact that it can cause you a lot of problems if you stop it suddenly.\n\nCommon health problems seen with the sudden withdrawal of Trazodone are stomach bloating, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping. This can disrupt your digestive system and make you feel tired all the time. The headache after discontinuing the drug can cause you forgetfulness, lethargy, lightheadedness, and confusion. If you suddenly stop taking the drug at night, it can cause abrupt insomnia. In severe cases, it can also cause a feeling of tiredness, shortness of breath, deterioration in your thinking, and constant feeling of despair.\n\nSo, if you abruptly make the decision to stop using the drug, we suggest that you first consult a health professional who can help you gradually cut back on the medication in your body before stopping using it altogether. This will slow down the effects and allow you to avoid withdrawal. Usually, you need to reduce the dosage gradually over a period of time to avoid the symptoms that can occur when you suddenly stop taking the drug."}

Use soap and water and don\u2019t forget to dry your hands well.\n\nWatch Video\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Body Site & Clean the Skin\n\n- Remember, people with diabetes should rotate \u201cbody sites\u201d every day to avoid sore and tender skin.\n- There are five recommended sites for administering insulin: abdomen, upper arms folds, upper thighs, the area around the navel and back of the upper arms.\n- Always use a clean, sanitized surface to prepare your insulin.\n- There is no need to inspect for redness at your injection sites before giving yourself a new injection. However glucometers with a blood ketone testing strip can somewhat confirm that the area you are going to use for that shot is nearly devoid of any kind of infection. It must be noted that blood glucometers are not meant for testing ketone levels, and are most suitable for blood glucose levels. Glucometers are not 100% accurate and rates of false negatives are high. These are not a replacement for a personal and family physician examination.\nWatch Video\n\n### Step 3: Inspect the Vial\n\n- Look at the outside of the vial for any sign of tampering and check the expiration date.\n- Wipe it down with an alcohol pad and make sure the rubber top of the vial is clean and intact.\n\nWatch Video\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Correct Dosage\n\n- It\u2019s always best to use a separate dose of insulin to administer your insulin and a separate dose to prepare your injection. Some people write their dosage by hand or mark their syringe combs with tape, but this step can be confusing. Your doctor can teach you more accurate ways to do this. Be very careful not to inject a mixture of some insulin.\n- Make sure your syringe and needle are clean and sterile. Syringes should be changed after each use.

It is an annual herb known best for its mind-altering effects. It is the plant\u2019s dried flowers that produce the psychoactive effects of it. These flowers are commonly called nugs or buds and normally have a colour range of green to brown. They are often covered with small stubby white hairs, and the dried flowers are sometimes covered in a layer of resin, and appear shiny. Marijuana has a strong , pungent odour and some people also describe it as being peppery or musky.\nThe shrub can reach heights between 1 and 6 metres, with stems that measure 5 to 25 cm in diameter. Large, deep, palmately-lobed leaves measuring up to 15 cm are alternately arranged along the stems, though lower leaves may fall off if the plant matures. The plant has long, woody roots that reach several centimetres deep, growing in both open fields and understory conditions. The plant produces glandular trichomes on its leaves that contain most of the processed drug. The hairs are concentrated especially in the upper portion of the plant and are mainly spaced around the leaves and buds. It is two of these components that are found in marijuana \u2013 THC and CBD.\n\nA distinguishing characteristic between juvenile and adult marijuana is found in the colours of the leaves. The stems and leaves on a mature marijuana plant will be coloured green or a brownish green. Juvenile plants are generally pale green, with larger leaves and less trichome or hair functions.\nThe life cycle of the cannabis plant includes three stages:\nSeeds \u2013 105 degrees(F) germination or 405 in other conditions; root system develops in few days\nPlant (Veg.) \u2013 Heat optimum \u2013 photoperiod \u2013 25 to 30 degrees (C) sativa, 20 to 24 (C) indica; watering \u2013 stage 2 at 60 days, stage 3 at 90 to 120 days\nFlower \u2013 Optimum temperature \u2013 20 to 22 (C) sativa, 15 to 19 (C) indica\n\nCommon Marijuana Subtypes\nSativa: More accustom"}
{"text": "Question: nitroglycerin how it works? \n ### Answer: Nitroglycerin is in a group of drugs called vasodilators. Nitroglycerin relaxes your blood vessels (veins and arteries) so that blood can flow more easily. Some people with heart problems can benefit from this effect.\n\nNitroglycerin is a generic drug, which means it may be manufactured by different companies and sold in different forms. Nitroglycerin generic is generally based on a medicine that has previously been sold as a brand name drug.\n\nnitroglycerin used for what?\n\nNitroglycerin is used to treat symptoms of chest pain (angina) such as chest pain due to coronary artery disease. It converts coronary arteries so they can easily dilate reducing the tension associated generating cause chest pain. By increasing the flow of oxygenated blood in the heart, chest pain caused by blockage of the coronary arteries is prevented.\n\nnitroglycerin absorption\n\nSince nitroglycerin is usually absorbed systemically, any directly applied onto the skin in nitroglycerin patches will be directly associated with systemic exposure and systemically absorbed, excessive doses will also have direct effects in the cerebral and coronary circulations, which can in turn lead to severe headaches and vasodilatation. Despite of these disadvantages, still are recommended by drug agencies around the world to avoid the rapid peaks of plasma levels that occur following its oral use. injectable nitrogen in contrast, can have a slower systemic absorption, which can be a disadvantage in the case of asystoles given to people with coronary disorders. It is probably for this reason that injections are not usually preferred to other nitroglycerine preparations, this has a stable systemic release characteristic being much more biocompatible.\n\nExtensively, studies made with transdermal nitroglycerin gels indicate that they are more useful than patches, being studies that the use of nitroglycerin patches begin to trigger the pain killer effect in 10 minutes, while transdermal gels begin to trigger in 3 minutes. This facilitates the application of these gels so that they will be very useful for people with pain of unpleasant intensity and even more useful for people with slow and stable affections such as angina pectoris.\n\nnitroglycer"}

{"text": "Question: what is medication for singular 10 mg.? \n ### Answer: That\u2019s the common question when it comes to antihistamines. I\u2019m going to show you how to answer that question here.\n\nMy favorite brand of antihistamines is Singulair. They\u2019re one of the few anti-histamines that are FDA approved for use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and also for use in the treatment of allergies.\n\nI used to love taking antihistamines, but now I use them so infrequently. I feel like they dont do anything in my system, so I feel like they should be banned. I use them as a back-up if I cant get my usual dose of antihistamines in time.\n\nI know that some people are taking Singulair for asthma, but I think that is probably not a good idea if you are allergic to histamines. Also, I read that Singulair can cause seizures. I was very, very, VERY afraid. I had a seizure while taking Singular.\n\nI\u2019m sure that there are plenty of people out there who use Singulair to treat asthma, but the research on that hasn\u2019t been done. In fact, the research on Singulair has come out of the pharmaceutical industry. This is what makes people really upset about it. We need to find a way to get Singulair in enough people to see what the risks are.\n\nSolutair is an asthma medication that is now available for people who have not responded to other asthma medications.

{"text": "Question: what is marijuana\n? \n ### Answer: # Cannabis\n\n## The Chemistry Behind Weed\n\nMarijuana is a psychoactive drug extracted from the flowers and leaves of the cannabis plant, a plant that consists of 200 unique chemical compounds and is used for both recreational and medical purposes. Its most well known component is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an ingredient that produces the psychoactive effects associated with cannabis use. Shortly after THC enters the body, it attaches to cannabinoid receptors in the brain and binds with neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters send messages about the user\u2019s thoughts, feelings, movements, and senses. Marijuana\u2019s effect on these neurotransmitters (or \u201cmarijuana high\u201d) is one of the substances users enjoy most.\n\nMarijuana is one of the world\u2019s longest-known psychoactive drugs. It was known in mummified remains over 1,000 years before the Common Era. More recently, the drug became legal in the U.S. for medical purposes in the 1990s and has remained a hotly debated hot potato within the bureaucratic and political estates.\n\n## The Long-term Effects of Weed\n\nThe long-term effects of weed depend on the duration of use and individual tolerance to the substance. Risk factors increase as periods of use do, and greatly increase when the primary causation is addiction. Marijuana addiction entails a physical withdrawal and progression over months and years. Addiction will likely skew the user\u2019s brain over time to perceive\u2014and therefore seek out\u2014marijuana as a necessity.\n\nmarijuana's addictive effects can be most intrusive on the cognitive abilities of moderate/heavy users. This aspect of the drug is commonly referred to as amotivation, or what is clinically referred to as cognitive functioning. Marijuana use can numb the logical parts of the brain, creating a temporary illusion of euphoria that removes the user from the tangible world. For someone experiencing amotivation, the frivolousness around them seems extremely important. Conversely, the symbiotic relationship created within a user\u2019s social environment becomes both physically and psychologically devalued.\n\n## The effects of high\n\n4 reasons why weed affects us"}

A part of the stomach or the entire stomach may be removed in this procedure. Oncologists may also perform a stoma (artificial urinary opening) in addition to the surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation are also offered as additional treatment.\n\nSTAGE 2: Surgery is the most acceptable cure for localized stomach cancer. A portion of the stomach or the whole stomach is removed by surgeons to do this. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may also occur simultaneously as the surgery.\n\nSTAGE: If the methods applied to stages 1 and 2 don\u2019t work, stage 3, 4 can be diagnosed. In this case, the surgery will occur. In addition to this, interventional treatment occurs. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can also be used as a combination treatment.\n\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy are used as an interventional treatment together. Removing stomach cancer entirely at this point is impossible. The patient may also be offered the option to push treatment further or end it.\n\nSurvival rates are measured in 5 year and 10 year periods. In a study conducted in the United States in 1999, around 26% of people diagnosed with stage 1 stomach cancer were alive after 10 years.

You suck the smoke in your lungs, and hold it for a second then exhale.\n\nI guess, you do not have to do this much. But, but, but I can say that smoking marijuana is an addiction like smoking cigarettes thus if this is true, you need to use very little quantities at a time. And have less time for it than you do for your favorite TV program.\n\nDo the majority of kids (homosexuals) smoke and do marijuana is the most used drug (including cigs)?"}

{"text": "Question: what would a normal dose be for valacyclovir\n? \n ### Answer: I'm currently treating a cold sore with 4g of lysine and tea tree oil. I use that for several days, then stop. When the cold sores don't hurt, no longer feel tender, and appear to be healing, I stop the lysine and tea tree oil ( as they irritate the skin) and then continue to use plain water to rinse out my mouth 4 times a day. I've found this does not cause any cross-reactivity, and actually stops the cold sores from coming back. However, this works on 80% of my cold sores, and not all of the recurrences. I get the sense that what is happening is the herpes virus is breaking out of hibernation (if you will) and coming towards the surface, becomes inefficient, and is \"cleaned up\".\n\nSo it's a process of interrupting the ascendance of the herpes virus to the surface, and keeping it there until the body gets it \"under control\". I need either one thing or the other - (1) something that does what lysine/tea tree oil does at the skin level, which is interfer with the ascendance of the virus to the surface, but does not cause the side effects or (2) a way to clean up the herpes virus that is \"near\" the surface (which causes the symptoms and the sores).\n\nHas anybody done what I'm describing?

They can take four to six weeks to start to work, so often when starting these drugs you are expected to wait to withdraw them. Some antidepressants must not be stopped suddenly, but are reduced over time to avoid dangerous conditions. Treatment with Effexor is often long term.\n\n## Does Effexor weaning cause anxiety?\n\nWeaning from the medication at the end of the study was consistently associated with increases in anxiety and anger, and drops in the mood scores. The rates of success for the withdrawal varieties are thought to be much less than reported here, as the efficacy of acute doses of Effexor (and other SSRIs) is itself disputed.

{"text": "Question: how ph change with antibiotic\n? \n ### Answer: Antibiotics are a group of drugs that are used to treat bacterial infections. They work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics can be divided into two main categories: bacteriostatic and bactericidal. Bacteriostatic antibiotics inhibit the growth of bacteria, while bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria.\n\nThe pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A solution with a pH below 7 is acidic, while a solution with a pH above 7 is alkaline.\n\nThe pH of a solution can change when antibiotics are added. This is because antibiotics can affect the pH of the solution in which they are dissolved. For example, some antibiotics can make a solution more acidic, while others can make a solution more alkaline.\n\nThe pH of a solution can also change when antibiotics are added because the antibiotics can react with the components of the solution. For example, some antibiotics can react with the water in a solution, which can change the pH of the solution.\n\nThe pH of a solution can also change when antibiotics are added because the antibiotics can react with the bacteria in the solution.

{"text": "Question: how does vitamin d help our bodies? \n ### Answer: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, food, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first occurs in the liver and converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol. The second occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], also known as calcitriol.\n\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany. It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis.\n\nVitamin D has other roles in the body, including modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation. Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D. Many cells have vitamin D receptors, and some cells have the 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme that converts 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, and can thus produce bioactive vitamin D locally.\n\nVitamin D deficiency is common and is caused by inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate vitamin D intake, and inadequate absorption of vitamin D or impaired vitamin D activation. It is associated with an increased risk of falls, bone fractures, certain cancers, cardiovascular disease"}

Ultrafiltration membranes, such as ISO, will produce gels during the filtration. Although the product claims to accurately determine the parallelism between the filtrate and the clarification under normal conditions, it is usually a result of the filtration operator. Improper operation caused by disruption and impaction of gel.\n\n(1) Inlet tube configuration How to connect the inlet tubes of membrane filtration equipment? For the same amount of samples, four tubes can be used to filter four kinds of samples; one or two tubes can be used to filter in batches. In the first method, the flow balance is better after the batch filtration, and the pore block will not occur due to blockage; In the second method, there may be blockage when processing a sample in a batch, resulting in the need to replace the membrane samples.\n\n(2) Ultrafiltration flow balance Before filtration, pay attention to the flow balance of the input and the outlet. Roller pump, three-roller pump and other pumps are convenient for flow balance adjustment; peristaltic pump flow adjustment is inconvenient before filtration.\n\n(3) Do not change the volume of the membrane Firstly, the membrane should be washed with 10 times the volume of the sample solution; secondly, the height of the liquid should be adjusted to the 1/3 position of the tube; then, stop the input water, and pay attention to the overflow of the outlet, so as to prevent the face of the plate from blocking.\n\n(4) Sample size There are two types of polymer plugs when the amount of filtrate is too large: one is placed on the filter element. The high volume cannot be withdrawn from the bottom of the filter element, resulting in the loss of the polymer plug; The second is plugged by the mass inlet, resulting in the inability to flow due to the formation of high-pressure.\n\n(5) Filtration pressure In the filtration process, the pressure on the top of the filter element should be kept very low to avoid entering"}

{"text": "Question: shingles vaccine how often\n? \n ### Answer: Shingles vaccine how often? A lot depends on who you ask.  Most practitioners of naturopathic medicine are advised to give the shingles vaccine only to certain high-risk patients such as those with HIV, AIDS, organ transplants, and cancer patients on chemotherapy.  Others arbitrarily decide to vaccinate on a case-by-case basis. Further, individual risk factors of the patients lives are considered.  Likewise, some patients want a stronger pharmaceutical protection while others reject the vaccine as strongly as natural herbs to treat shingles outbreaks.  Despite all the warnings and apprehensions of both patients and practitioners alike shingles or herpes zoster vaccines are advocated largely for public health benefit due to positive efficacy and effectiveness research (Jones et. Al,2007) Hence, shingles vaccine policy and dissemination likely to be risky business, but, nonetheless effective and warranted from the perspective of the clinicians. Case in point?  Let\u2019s follow the advice of Dr. Zhu Lijian MD, Director of the Shanghai Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (SCDC) in relation to a recently identified public health crisis of the H1N1 virus that has since been declared a global pandemic.\n\nHere is a quick summation, Dr. Lacarlo made the following comments at the outbreak of the Avian flu, \u201cwhile containing the H5N1 virus there is an added possibility that H5N1 might mutate into a new strain that is almost entirely different from its predecessor and more virulent than previous influenza epidemics.  H5N1 virus does not seem to transmit among humans.  From these two considerations we believe it is too early to implement the nation-wide hermetics or vaccination to try to control this virus\u201d.   Thus, most people share a common belief, vaccines are an effective and, perhaps only protective measure for both targeted and controlled outbreaks.  Indeed, the shingles vaccine has thus far demonstrated excellent results for both physician and patients nationwide.  Despite any short-term and possible long-term impairments shingles vaccine should be capture thereby not fall victim to the historical nature of past pharma intimidation tactics.  In the final analysis few practitioners and researchers alike believe that an effective vaccine for shingles is warranted."}

{"text": "Question: how should i dilute ceftriaxone \"infection?\"? \n ### Answer: There are many different infections that can be treated with ceftriaxone. The concentration of the antibiotic may vary depending on the type of infection being treated. It is best to speak with your doctor or pharmacist to determine the correct dosage and concentration for your specific situation.\n\n### Can I dilute a prescription?\n\nYes, you can dilute a prescription. Some medications come in concentrations that are too concentrated for the dosage you need. You\u2019ll need to dilute the medication yourself so you can use the correct dosage.\n\nIt is important to get the correct dosage from the medication. Talk with your physician or pharmacist to find out how to dilute the medication so you can use the correct dosage.\n\nTypically, at least enough water to fill the vial is added to make the solution.\n\nThe instructions for diluting antibiotics will be different for each type of medicine; since ENTREM\u00ae contains the same medicine as Rocephin\u00ae (ceftriaxone), it\u2019s likely they will be similar. If you\u2019re unsure of how to dilute ENTREM safely, you should ask your pharmacist or medical team.\n\n- IV (intravenous) antibiotics are injected directly into the bloodstream and are intended to be given in the hospital setting. Therefore, they are very potent and could cause severe infections if they were not carefully prepared.\n- ENTREM\u00ae can be given intramuscularly or subcutaneously, which are easier to manage at home.\n- Do not administer or mix ENTREM\u00ae with intravenous cannulae.\n\nIf a computerized dispensing unit is used, start an infusion, not a swab.\n\nYou can ask your pharmacist for advice. The best way to dilute ceftriaxone is to use a sterile solution. There are many different methods of preparation.\n\nIf you cant make a full coffee pot worth of ceftriaxone\u2014cantjut stretch it far enough\u2014buy ceftriaxone 3x a month instead of twice, econ etap.

{"text": "Question: how long can i take ibuprofen? \n ### Answer: Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. It is available over-the-counter and is commonly used to treat headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, and arthritis.\n\nThe recommended dosage of ibuprofen is 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 3200 mg per day. It is important to follow the dosage instructions on the label or as directed by your healthcare provider.\n\nIbuprofen can be taken with or without food, but it is best to take it with food to reduce the risk of stomach upset. It is also important to drink plenty of water while taking ibuprofen to prevent dehydration.\n\nIt is generally safe to take ibuprofen for a short period of time, but it should not be taken for more than 10 days without consulting a healthcare provider. Long-term use of ibuprofen can increase the risk of serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding, kidney damage, and heart problems.\n\nIf you are taking ibuprofen for a long period of time, it is important to have regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your health and ensure that the medication is not causing any adverse effects.\n\nIn addition to taking ibuprofen, it is important to follow a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of pain and inflammation. This includes eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress.\n\nIt is also important to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as these can increase the risk of stomach bleeding and other serious side effects.\n\nIn conclusion, ibuprofen is a safe and effective medication for relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and lowering fever.

{"text": "Question: how often is the tetanus shot \"given?\"? \n ### Answer: The pediatrician's office told me that Not all tetanus shots count. Each shot needs a diphtheria and pertussis (aka \"whooping cough\") shot. And she said there should have been 4 diptheria and tetanus shots, before the DPT. But he only had 2 Tetanus shots. Note: this was post-teen; he was vaccinated through late teens.\n\n#### Nicole\n\nwith 7 months old\n\nI have the same concern about my 7 month olds schedule.  He had 4 DPT shots by 18 months, we had to make a second appointment just to get the 3rd and 4th Tetanus only part of the DPT.  What a pain!  My pediatrician does not think this is a problem.  She stated as long as the child was receiving some Tetanus shots after 18 months he should be fine.  There were not any booster shots to receive before the age of 7 in his schedule.  Being this is his schedule, I am not going to argue with it, although I would like to know the same thing you are.  I am sure he will get plenty of Tetanus booster shots in the future, since I teach in a daycare.  I'm sure if my pediatrician would have known he had only 2 tetanus shots by 18 months, she would have asked me to reschedule the shot without the diptheria and pertussis parts.\n\n#### Kristen\n\nwith 9 months old\n\nDetails on that particular problem are in my article linked above. I agree that two is less (obviously, right?) than four; but I also think the problem is that AFTER age 18 months, they only get boosters. In other words, they never get junior booster and any vaccines after that are pre-teen/teen age. My thing is that I gave the kidlets all the shots they were due from birth to age 18, but then never went on with the recommended older child ones, so they are sort of \"out of sync\" (not chronological) and missing boosters.\n\nPerhaps the series of childhood shots has another path if we time them in advance of age requirements? I am still trying to research that one."}

{"text": "Question: how do steroids effect the digestive system? \n ### Answer: The digestive system is composed of the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), the large intestine (appendix, cecum, colon, rectum and anus), the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. Thus, any system relating to the urinary system may experience negative side effects, including male and female reproductive organs. Sex hormone alteration, development and male/female secondary sex characteristics interfere with sexual attraction and behavior. Most are due to sex hormone changes or direct effects of androgen or estrogen (gender hormones) deficiencies or excesses. For example, the bone marrow is a part of the lymphatic system and is vulnerable to over-stimulation by an androgenic hormone such as testosterone. Thus, blood clotting (thrombocytosis) is one of the more common side effects of androgen abuse or supplementation shown by studies. Population studies point to a strong correlation between the individual risk of cardiovascular heart disease and androgen exposure.\n\nThe major effects relate to\n\nChanges in sex-related hormone levels, including lower testosterone levels in men, and suppression of positive hormones like luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in both men and women. This direct impact on the endocrine system or increased blood clotting due to thrombocytosis. The liver, brain, kidneys, adrenal gland, eyes and bones may also be affected.\n\nThe digestive system has three parts, the small intestine, the large intestine, and the accessory organs which include the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. These organs are made up of glands, muscles and nerves that break down food to produce nutrients for your body. The digestive barriers protect tissues against the effects of the digestive products by protecting against enzymes and other chemicals which break down nutrients. The liver acts to clear the blood of toxins that might otherwise be toxic to the rest of your body. The gallbladder collects bile from the liver which is secreted to aid in digestion. A hormone called gastrin controls gastric secretion"}

COVID-19 vaccination is especially important if you\u2019re pregnant and at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including people who are overweight or obese, or have a condition like heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes.\n\nWhat we\u2019re still learning: There\u2019s no information specifically about COVID-19 vaccination and pregnancy and breastfeeding from clinical trials. Hospitals are reporting that they are seeing mostly unvaccinated people in their COVID-19 units.

COVID-19 vaccination belongs to the categories of medicines for which COVID-19 vaccine safety update and reporting systems are in place.\n\nBenefits of the vaccine include these:\n\n- The vaccines prevent most infections and for those who do get COVID-19, most cases are mild rather than serious illness\n- Vaccination protects the pregnant person\n- Vaccination protects the unborn baby\n- Vaccination protects those around the pregnant person\n\nThe benefits of being vaccinated for pregnant people and their babies outweigh any unknown risks\n\nQ15 ?

You will also want to know the answer to your question. That depends on the medical condition you treat with the antibiotic and the medicine to be used after you take the antibiotic. But, in most cases, it should not be a long period of time but how it all works is also a question you should ask your doctor.\n\nI\u2019m not very sure about that, but I know that most antibiotics like that tend to have a period of a few days that they need to work.

Maybe you are suffering from acne and you are suffering from a cold and you took both medications?\n\nThe reason why they give you meds to take after another is kinda of\u2026 complicated I guess. I don\u2019t know exactly myself, but it has something with the time which antibiotics can work efficiently themselves through the activity of their agents. And sometimes you can get the effect in a few days when you\u2019ve taken antibiotics. After this time span, it\u2019s needed for a different medicine to work since all the bacteria will have already became immune to the old medication.

{"text": "Question: warfarin and cabbage? \n ### Answer: By Dr. Chuck Dietzen | Sep. 17, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s very common for people to wonder if they should avoid certain foods or food supplements when taking warfarin. As a rule of thumb, read the label, know your anticoagulant and keep a food diary for a few days and let your physician know your finding. Hopefully, there will be no changes as a result.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve answered some of the most commonly asked questions about what foods not to eat> while taking warfarin below.\n\n1. Is citrus, orange juice or grapefruit bad for me if taking warfarin (Coumadin)?\n\nNot necessarily, but be cautious. There are several prescription drugs that can potentially interact with grapefruit juice and warfarin. If the patient answers \u2018yes\u2019 to the question about grapefruit, right now, I would not suggest grapefruit. Always talk with your doctor and then be cautious with your choices about drinking any of that type of juice.\n\n2. Can I eat broccoli with warfarin?\n\nBroccoli and other leafy greens are on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s list of best foods. They\u2019re great! But just because vitamin K is good for you, doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t interfere with anticoagulants such as warfarin if you are eating too much of them.\n\n3.

{"text": "Question: how long for allergic reaction after using nivolumab? \n ### Answer: # 1. Skin rashes\n\nYour skin may become red, flushed, or itchy, or you may develop a rash or hives.\n\n- Your doctor may prescribe antihistamines to control itching.\n- Ask your doctor if you can apply a small amount of hydrocortisone cream to the affected area to relieve itching.\n\n# 2. Allergic Pneumonia\n\nThe makeup of your lungs, bronchi, and trachea may be altered, making these allergic diseases dangerous, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a type of allergic reaction.\n\n- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immune response to an antigen.  In most cases, inhalations are the cause in otherwise healthy people.\n- This often manifests clinically as a diffuse interstitial, nodular, or mixed interstitial-terminal pattern of injury with a prominent bronchiolocentric lymypogenic composition.\n- The diffuse inflammation may cause the lungs to be stuck together, which can compress the vessels and make breathing difficult.\n- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is manifested by a triad of insidious onset of symptoms, such as cough (dry or productive), shortness of breath, and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on the chest X-ray. Other symptoms include fever, night sweats, and malaise.\n- Its contrast on chest x-ray is not specific. Because it is common to find a diffuse interstitial picture in its early stages and a nodular or mixed picture with prolonged illness, a high index of suspicion should be maintained when the disease presents with inspiratory wheezing difficulties and bilateral lower lobe density on chest x-rays. We can't be certain of disease progression, but based on a literature review, it seems there is a higher rate of progression of the disease in patients who demonstrate poor performance on pulmonary function tests and who have other comorbidities.\n- Allergen avoidance (such as cold showers instead of hot water or the use of a fixed range hood) and symptomatic treatment were used successfully to treat the disease in the past.

However, some women experience temporary discomfort (which can include a hot flash after discontinuing the use of the medicine; and the fact that physical activity or other natural factors can also produce heat flushes, make it difficult to tell if what you\u2019re feeling is due to post-menopause or due to your recent cessation of Premarin consumption\n\nEvery year, millions of women experience the ramifications of treating a number of potentially debilitating medical ailments from the benefits stipulated by the use of useful pharmaceutical drugs. As such, users of prescription drugs are often faced with the tough challenge of having to evaluate the pros and cons of what taking a certain drug might do to their overall health.\n\nOne of the most prevalent medications facing this very dilemma is Premarin. As a treatment for a host of conditions, Premarin has successfully been delivered to millions of women. Given the strong nature and diversity of options offered by this drug, it may have helped many women reach a favorable status on the health scale.\n\nMore to the point, Premarin is a combination of estrogenic derivatives (conjugated estrogens) which has been administered to menopausal women as a means to alleviate or otherwise provide relief from the often pronounced and potentially debilitating side effects of entering and experiencing menopause (like hot flashes, itching, and pain).

(5) Impaired gating of central neurotransmitters involved in respiratory control pathways.\n\n(1) Improvements in the regulation of the respiratory muscles. Glucocorticoids increase the power of the diaphragm. Glucocorticoids act through altering fiber-type distribution as well as directly by protein synthesis. Direct effect on the diaphragm is independent of the speed of breathing.\n\n(2) The human body cells have a relatively reactive oxygen species (ROS) which belong to the class of chemicals capable of nitrous oxide oxidation inhibits inflammation caused by neutrophils. Inflammatory cells cause oxidative stress in the lungs and can lead to gradual impairment of pulmonary functions, and thus corticosteroids can play a significant role in such areas. It is known that the lungs of prematurely born infants have a limited ability to absorb oxygen from the air, in addition to insufficient clearance, and this can lead to tachypnea and mild forms of respiratory distress syndrome. Since it is not technically possible to extend the time of gestation in the womb, prevention of these disorders is possible with steroids.\n\n(3) \u201cInhaled corticosteroids can also reduce neutrophilic inflammation.\u201d How does this help? In healthy adverse fluctuations in lung function occupy a neutral zone (112-130 respiratory cycles per minute, number 1.5 - 3.5 liters per minute and minute volume 8.5 - 15.5 l) in patients with COPD lung function can be located \"over the abscissa and does not return to normal\" (117 respiratory cycles per minute, tidal volume of 0.6 -"}
