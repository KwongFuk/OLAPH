{"text": "Question: What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease? \n ### Answer: Polycyctic kidney disease is a component of Mallory-Weiss syndrome in the Pweb group. Significant renal cysts occur in up to 24 to 30% of individuals with Noonan syndrome and provide a characteristic feature. Individuals with large renal cysts appear to have the most typical features of Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome and polycystic disease (PCKD) have some degree of overlap, and a few members of the Pweb class, have been discovered with PCKD. Some sporadic instances of NL syndrome with excessive renal cysts are described in the literature. These people display a polycystic kidney phenotype, on occasion combined with polycystic liver disease, in addition to the other NL features. The majority of these cases were found in families confirming autosomal dominant inheritance. An NL syndrome displaying a polycystic kidney phenotype can serve as an easily understood syndrome aided by autosomal dominant transmission, large multi-cystic round kidneys, renal failure post-juvenile, hearing loss, lentigines, short stature, and pulmonary stenosis. In the clinical simulation, distinctive people described for the polycystic kidney disease exhibited a relative absence of lentigines compared to other NL spectrum disorders. A member of the MIR17HG locus recently identified for autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome, causing deafness, renal system disease, unusual facial appearance, and short stature in individual, also studied for recurring cases of PCKD accompanying NLS.

{"text": "Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients? \n ### Answer: All persons with acute syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent) should be treated with intramuscular procaine penicillin as follows: 2.4 MU (6 MU for penicillin-sensitive persons). Treatment of patients with ECDC-defined primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis would be 1 dose of benzathine penicillin (2.4 MU given IM) if 24 STC or more are present in any organ sites. Untreated syphilis can be transmitted to others by sexual contact. Avoid being sexually active for 1 incubation period after treatment.

{"text": "Question: Can the administration of anesthesia, during hip replacement surgery, have any negative cognitive effects, especially on patients demonstrating FXTAS? \n ### Answer: This question arises because human genetic diseases are more prevalent, and surgical procedures are increasingly performed that contain high doses of anesthetics, such as arthroplasty. Hence, emphasis has been placed in recent years on finding methods and strategies to help anesthesiologists monitor patients with these diseases to reduce as much as possible any risk of negative events during and after their surgery. In addition, evidence is accumulating that the administration of anesthetics to symptomatic patients with fragile X conditions can negatively affect cognitive performance. For example, Young et al. (1999) found that the full range of anesthesia affect the antioxidative system in the hip putamen of FXTAS patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which anesthesia induces the onset of this disease and the way in which specific anesthetics interact together to influence FXS clinical phenotypes, and especially to clarify the role of the middle cerebral artery anomaly in the expression of FXTAS."}

{"text": "Question: Is uveitis an autoimmune disease? \n ### Answer: The answer is not simple. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the intraocular tissues (the uvea) and is traditionally classified as either anterior or posterior. An immune system\u2013centered approach to the classification of inflammatory disorders termed autoimmune disease is characterized by inflammation of tissues caused by self-antigens.1 These self-antigens can be organs or tissues (i.e., type I diabetes affecting the pancreas). Extrinsic or environmental factors that can act as mono- or polyantigens2 triggering the adaptive system are called triggers (smoking or anti-glaucoma drugs). In patients with uveitis, multiple factors often contribute to the initiation and progression of disease. The specific etiology of a patient's uveitis is highly dependent on age, gender, race, genetic inheritance, and whether or not it is associated with any systemic autoimmune rheumatological disorder."}

{"text": "Question: What are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Are there long-term pulmonary sequelae? Can marrying your cousin cause this? \n ### Answer: ANSWER: There are numerous possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, some as insignificant as a \u201chole\u201d in the membrane that occurred during the early stages of your baby's development. If congenital diaphragmatic hernia is present during fetal life, there will be a reduction in lung volume and a rightward shift of the mediastinum. Potential long-term complications may include decreased lung functioning and pulmonary hypertension (elevated blood pressure in part of the lungs). There are several diseases in which diaphragmatic hernias may occur, including those with reduced formation of the diaphragm, such as Prune Belly Syndrome and Jeune Syndrome, as well as others in which the weakness of the diaphragm results from poor closure after the structures separate. Factual congenital diaphragmatic hernia does not cause the diseases themselves, but there may be a genetic link between them. While the incidence is higher in certain races, for example, children of Spanish or French Canadian descent have a notably higher risk (11.3 per 10,000 births), congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in all ethnicities. HOWEVER, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are both associated with neurofibromatosis, a hereditary condition frequently caused by a lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Therefore, if you have caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, you may want to have your genes tested to see if they have a similar genetic basis. Genetic counseling will be important for individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia during preconception, conception, gestation, birthing, and in the postnatal period."}

But there are many more doctors who do not come from the functional medicine perspective (not basing diagnosis on a search for leaky gut or other functional imbalances). Such doctors would generally advise avoiding high intensity intensity exercise (which is a heart strain, rather than lung strain, as the maximum asthmatic ventilation is on a steady basis) and controlling asthma is difficult and stubborn then the advice would be about mechanisms, principles, etc. They may advise exercises, specific gym equipment/exercises, limiting the type and duration especially for those of severe asthma.

{"text": "Question: Is fildena like viagra and how does it work? \n ### Answer: Fildena is a popular ED medication drug used to treat erectile dysfunction disorder. Fildena is presumed to activate the nitric oxide synthase and increase the release of nitric oxide. Fildena leads to increased levels of cGMP, especially in the penile tissues. This facilitates smooth muscle relaxation in the penile tissues, increased blood flow in the penile region, simultaneous erection, and reduces the painful feeling while having sex, especially for older men."}

{"text": "Question: Can low dose naltrexone be used to treat severe depression? \n ### Answer: Studies have shown a relation between major depression and a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and a few have shown that patients with major depression have less dopamine D2 receptors (122\u2013124). In cell culture, low doses (1 nM) of naltrexone suppressed the degradation of norepinephrine and relieved depression without affecting signaling at the mu opioid receptor (67). This suggests that low doses of naltrexone may even be effective for people with a low density of mu opioid receptors in treatment resistant depression. Further studies are needed to determine whether low dose naltrexone can be used safely and effectively in these cases."}

{"text": "Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal? \n ### Answer: Hantavirus is a virus that can cause hemorrhagic fever. Whilst these illnesses are generally severe, they can mostly be treated in hospital. On rare occasions, however, the infection can lead to a more serious illness called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and is commonly fatal if left untreated. This syndrome occurs throughout the world and most hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents. In the UK, for example, there is an isolated population of bank voles on Brownsea Island in Southampton. People who visit or live on Brownsea can become infected with a hantavirus called Seoul virus (which causes fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and a rash) from infected voles. Some infected individuals may then develop hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and lymphocytic meningoencephalitis - a serious illness of the lungs and brain."}
{"text": "Question: Is there always an elevated temperature associated with appendicitis? \n ### Answer: We all agree to the fact that rise of body temperature is an ultimate sign of an ongoing inflammation and during acute infectious disease. It\u2019s quite noteworthy that there is a lack of enough clinical data about fever prevalence among patients admitted with suspected appendicitis due to the misdiagnosis of this entity . The level of fever was reported to range between 36\u00b71-38\u00b75\u00b0C and could reach even 41\u00b0C [, , ]. Furthermore, the occurrence of macroscopic purulent peritoneal exudate is not an everyday phenomenon as some researchers present serious concerns about the difficult identification of purulent collection especially in case of detection in the post-operative period. It may be confusing with applying suspicious intra-abdominal hypertension or specific disease and predictive tests of complicated appendicitis such as CT-scan [4,, , , ]. So, in a large proportion of patients with acute appendicitis, the absence of established risk factors for complicated disease may be contributing to the diagnostic \u201cnoise\u201d to prove an urgent indication for laparoscopy or laparotomy. In many instances, using more sensitive indicators to predict severe appendicitis could have prevented many forms of unnecessary tests. MFA is a predictor of acute severe appendicitis, and correct selection of the appropriate imaging modality for surgery or treatment guided by repeat image-guided reassessment specially CT-scan might be preventive. Considering that CT-scan allows necessary invasive intervention compared to the traditional option such as ultrasound scan."}

The condition is usually diagnosed through amniocentesis, or with noninvasive prenatal screening in the first trimester.Karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization are both diagnostic modalities for trisomy 13."}
{"text": "Question: To what extent is quinine in seltzer water effective in treating leg cramps? \n ### Answer: Commercial seltzer water was evaluated for its quinine content. The solution prepared by the manufacturer was consistent in its quinine level (approximately 50 mg/L) over several weeks. Small quantities of the solution were used to treat 1 patient at a time to minimize wastage. The number of bottles needed was relatively low, and seltzer water is inexpensive and easy to find. Furthermore, because it can be self-administered and is easy to carry, seltzer water is more convenient to use as a treatment than other methods (e.g., oral quinine tablets, lotions, or solutions). No severe adverse effects were found for intramuscular injections or quinine lotions. Whereas lotion applications are messy, intramuscular injections are painful, and seltzer water provided a rapid response most similar to that of intramuscular injections than to that of lotions.2,9 Finally, seltzer water can help mitigate the side effects of oral quinine. (It should be noted that when oral quinine and seltzer water are used, they should not mix as they can cause severe vomiting.)Limitations of the technology and disseminationRegulatory concernsRegulations regarding the use of quinine for GI preventative indication vary across the countries, limiting attempts to pass formal legislation for this indication. For example, in the United States, data and protocols were reviewed by the principal regulatory body, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for as many as 15 years with the goal of approving quinine for use as an antiemetic. However, the FDA impeded the approval process. Despite the requirement for a worksheet explaining the foams, no official decision was made. For multijurisdictional approval, the agency explicitly stated that there was no interested party supporting the marketing of the product. Although routine consultation was continued over the years between European Union agencies, they were unable to pass regulations without the support of the FDA. Use of quinine to prevent GI-related and other forms of vomiting remains banned in the United States.Although seltzer water may be more convenient and less costly for use to prevent an attack of cramps given that much less drug is needed than by using quinine infusion, the fastest approach is still the patient\u2019s"}

{"text": "Question: What is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? \n ### Answer: MNT formularies, with different tolerability and side effect profiles, form the basis of guidelines for choosing an optimal hypoglycaemic drug. Current ADA, ADA/EASD and other guidelines suggest starting a patient with MNT once it has failed. The question thus is what is the maximum dose of metformin A patient can take with adequate safety profile? We find roughly six guidelines, and there is real diversity of opinion. Should they be all condemned as incompetent practices or there are some scientific grounds present for each of the guidelines? Various guidelines suggest metformin's daily dose (if increased from initial dose) should be based on number of glucose-lowering drugs prescribed, age of the patient, kidney function and diabetes duration (bracketing increased risk of lactic acidosis). These guidelines are also based on various studies that have at some point or other tried to establish the maximum metformin dose on the basis of LAB (doto)."}

This is responsible for the majority of clinical symptoms of KTS.Cardinal findings in KTS include hyperplasia of skin and soft tissue, musculoskeletal deformity, lymphatic malformations, and ocular complications.Genetic linkage has not been definitively established for KTS. Results of many previous studies seemed to show that the majority of KTS patients were genetically predisposed to the condition. Familial occurrence ranges from 3% to 22%. Recessive and dominant inheritance have been suggested but neither theory adequately explains the wide variety of affected body parts.Surgical therapies may include angiographic embolization and wide surgical excision.Suggested treatment includes physical therapy, exercise, and attention to posture to help prevent contractures.Individual treatment must be limited according to unique characteristics of KTS patients.Recommendation for treatment should be individually tailored to the child and their specific presentation.Patient-centered communication and parent involvement with treatment plan are imperative for optimal development and wellbeing."}

{"text": "Question: What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C (a genetic change) Issues and long term prognosis? \n ### Answer: Regarding the long-term prognosis, we should consider several factors as a whole. These include, but not limited to, the genetic background; environmental factors such as smoking, coffee, and alcohol; low folate intake; and manners related to the disease and its treatment. MTHFR is a gene that can influence the process of folate metabolism. Homozygous mutations in this gene is known to cause a significant decrease in the level of activity of the gene. Some studies have shown that homozygous MTHFR A1298C has increased cancer rate. However, the majority of research shows that it has no certain impact on long-term prognosis, and unlike some other genetic changes, it cannot impact life expectancy. Homozygous MTHFR A1298C has some effect on increasing the risk of some diseases in some patients. It has increased risk of cancers such as folic acid deficiency and cervical cancer , and in other studies, its association with pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , and colorectal cancer  have been reported. Aside from cancerous diseases, homozygous MTHFR A1298C has also been linked to C677T polymorphism  and other diseases such as MTHFR A1298CC/C677TT which is a determinant of ischemic stroke . As can be seen, the effects of MTHFR A1298C mutation are not limited to a single aspect, and this extends to recurrent pregnancy loss. 5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) A1298C mutation has some effect on the recurrent pregnancy loss, but the extent to which this mutation affects it, and what other factors play a role in this condition are factors that need to be considered in these cases . 5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation has shown an increased risk of pregnancy loss. Based on several studies, a mixed mutation of the homozygous MTHFR A1298C and C677T mutation has had no relation to pregnancy termination.  Nevertheless, there are studies that have shown an increased association between"}

{"text": "Question: What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body? \n ### Answer: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body\u2019s immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This results in a lack of insulin, which is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes typically develops in children or young adults, but it can also occur in older adults. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and age. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and can develop at any age, but it is more common in older adults. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It typically resolves after pregnancy, but women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life."}

{"text": "Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.? \n ### Answer: In fact, TG is the coenzyme (not cofactor) that carries electrons from NADH to Oxidized LDL cholesterol/ferricyanide to reduce ferricin+ electrons to ferrocyanide (hypoxanthine). TG is required at approximately a 3:1 ratio to cholesterol. The lower the TGs then the lower the Oxidized LDL C cholesterol potential to damage the vascular endothelium is, although what is termed oxidized LDL C is considerably less likely to cause vascular damage than coagulated Lipoproteins with Phospholipids (VLDL and LDL) as well as Activated MacroPhages due to the largely elevated levels of PAI-1. PAI-1 over being produced in the liver by activated hepatic stellate cells, is an important wound clotting factor that plasmalogens can prevent coagulation of Lipoproteins, and thus vascular occlusion-causing thrombotic occlusions are almost entirely preventable from those factors that are phospholipid-dependent."}
{"text": "Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit? \n ### Answer: It is known that calcium supplements can cause the urine to become very alkaline and that calcium crossing the kidney epithelial cell with this degree of alkalinity results in extracellular calcium (hard) deposits in the kidney. We have suggested that the addition of magnesium to supplements was useful to prevent calcium deposits in the sub-endothelial space. To date, it is unknown if calcium supplementation with magnesium is more effective than calcium alone, and definitive studies addressing this question will likely take years to complete. Therefore, we would suggest that individuals with osteoporosis or who are at higher risk for osteoporosis receive concurrent magnesium along with their calcium supplements, until the optimal use of magnesium in supplements can be judged in large clinical trials."}

{"text": "Question: Can chronic cervicitis cause infertility? Why would tampons cause inflammation? \n ### Answer: Was scarring from previous procedures causative? Timing and presence of sexually transmitted infections continue to confound reports, despite medical intervention (Delaney and Sullivan, 1999). As much as half of T. vaginalis burden is asymptomatic (Passman, 1983; Rosenbaum et al., 2002). Biopsies, Pap smears, and culture rely on active infection of vaginal and cervical mucosa and poor sampling of large bodies of vaginal secretions. Does infection delay a woman\u2019s reproductive life? Co-infections with pathogens complicate studies of the role of T. vaginalis in sperm dysfunction. The solitary progenitor of T. vaginalis originated from a parasitically breeding algae before evolving (Anderson et al., 1995). Do environmental conditions influence pathogenicity? These questions, motivating bench research for decades lack answers. Researchers must understand Trichomonas cellular mechanisms, development under in vitro culture environments mimicking human hosts, and how an early transition from aqueous to nutrient compromised conditions may have compromised Trichomonas fitness under such conditions. Greater understanding may lead to novel prevention methods or genetic modifications to reduce pathogenicity."}

The results will help provide better evidence on whether metformin leads to an increase in blood pressure. Nevertheless, it seems that long-term metformin treatment less than first-line treatment with sulfonylureas does not significantly increase the incidence of hypertension. Additionally, metformin use has been recently associated with an improvement in BP among people with obesity without diabetes, a finding which if confirmed could provide a rationale for an anti-hypertensive effect for metformin."}

{"text": "Question: What are the effects of smoking and/or nicotine on the digestive system? \n ### Answer: Cigarette smoke has a detrimental effect on stomach function and can affect dryness of the mouth. It in addition has an effect on the digestion of carbohydrates and lipids, thereby rendering hepatocytes more susceptible to inflammation . Nicotine may reduce gastrointestinal motility, which may increase the risk for constipation . Smoking may also alter the activity of orexins, possibly contributing to obesity . What is the effect of smoking/nicotine on the colon/rectum? Cigarette smoke condensate has been found to have a carcinogenic and a colonotoxic effect on the rectal mucosa . These findings are not in favor of smoking on colon cancer or colorectal polyps although data is actually lacking . Yet there is also remarkably little research on the direct effect of nicotine on colon cancer . How does smoking/nicotine affect immune cells in the digestive tract? It is conceivable that immune cells in the gut are able to transfer their response by nicotine through the endothelium to other organs where inflammatory disorders may also develop . The ability of nicotine to affect various T-cell types is well investigated . It can also stimulate immune cells to elevate COX-2 in cells in the gut . NF-kB involved in inflammatory responses is activated by exposure to cigarette smoke or nicotine . One way nicotine has been described to promote tumor growth is by stimulating COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from immune cells. Inflammation may also be augmented by nicotine-induced reduction of cytokine secretion, T cell response and increased activation of platelets . What is the effect of nicotine/smoking on the pancreas? Nicotine in pancreatic cells has been shown to maintain cell viability by increasing GSH levels caused by impaired uptake of the precursor glutamate. The advantage of this is that fewer BTN1A1 exchangers are broken down by ROS and therefore cell viability is increased . In a moderate dose of nicotine Bass et al. observed an elevation of FFA, and a GLU increase . Vice versa, elevated blood levels of FFA are however a known risk factor for p"}

{"text": "Question: What is plantar fasiciitis, and how is it treated? \n ### Answer: Biomechanical ankle and foot injuries are common in sporting events. One such soft tissue injury, plantar fasciitis, is a painful disorder of the foot that affects runners and aerobics enthusiasts in particular. It is caused by the degeneration of a band of connective tissue running along the bottom of the foot, known as the plantar fascia.

A rheumatologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. They have extensive training in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and can help patients understand their disease, as well as how to best manage it. In addition to rheumatologists, there are other healthcare professionals, such as genetic counselors and immunologists, who can also be helpful in treating autoimmune diseases.

{"text": "Question: To what extent does Effexor cause ED? \n ### Answer: To what extent are SSRI treated depressed patients more prone to ED than depressed patients not treated with this class of drug, and to what extent are people with ED prone to depression? The simultaneity of two diseases neither definitively proving nor excluding a cause effect relations is not unusual and certainly not specific to ED. Attempts to answer the latter question with epidemiological or retrospective studies have raised methodological difficulties, leading some investigators to use sex hormones (variously defined) as a confounding factor in their studies [123, 125]. Sex hormones are poorly defined and measured and cannot easily represent the minimum biologic entity capable of inducing a desired response: the receptors. Given these biases and the fact that ED is a disease of known origin, it would be more appropriate to use animal models of choice behavior rather than human observational studies to examine the putative relationship between SSRI and sexual behavior. Obviously, in this case the difficulty is to identify a truly comparable model species to humans."}
{"text": "Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction? \n ### Answer: There is no direct literature to suggest that NSAIDs may produce erectile dysfunction. Although an indirect conclusion may be drawn from several other articles suggesting a positive correlation between prolonged erections and medication intake, it was hypothesized that indomethacin influence blood flow and produce tachyphylaxis of penile vasodilator vasoactive substances both important to achieving erection in the general population and penis rehabilitation in men who have had a radical prostatectomy [6, 21]. Additionally due to reduced nociceptive input anguish caused by inflammation can be avoided which may indirectly put one in a more comfortable situation to attempt sexual intercourse Finally as previously mentioned Non-aspirin NSAID's inhibit endogenous prostaglandin synthesis. Elevated amounts of prostaglandin I2 in blood have been linked to patients with erectile dysfunction . Dysfunction tends to be more severe in patients with more severe Hyperprostaglandinemia ."}

Some recommended permissible limits of magnesium are as follows : Magnesium intake from the diet, supplements, nutrients, and medicines should be between 320 and 420 mg per day for adults.The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of magnesium is 320 mg per day for adults.There are no fixed upper limits for magnesium intake from supplements unless magnesium salt is taken as therapy, where PO200 mg magnesium hydroxide per day is relatively safe also in prenatal care period .Long-term magnesium therapy for the treatment of heart disease is mainly limited by the gastrointestinal side effects of magnesium salts like diarrhea and nausea. On the other hand, side effects of oral intake of magnesium are generally modest compared to the disadvantages of parenteral administration routes. Supplements should only be taken between meals as they are likely to give gastrointestinal side effects ."}

{"text": "Question: taken off this medicine / how might it affect me? palmarosa? \n ### Answer: Research into palmarosa is in the starting blocks. Most studies want to find out more about the plant\u2019s properties, but by examining the published studies more in detail we will be able to discover parallels and differences with valerian extracts. A study with rats supports valerian\u2019s sedative effect . The test subjects took a drug in a 1:1 ratio with either desmodium or standard drug or with placebo. Both these combinations turned out to cause hyperactivity in the animals. The administration of a combination of sulfate of copper with Serc 500 mg reduces the requirement for standard drugs by 80 to 100%. Desmodium is a natural stabiliser which can be used to stop the sedative effect of serc. In several animal studies, the blood and brain levels of serotonin rose, which lead to an increase in systolic blood pressure. In the other studies, the influence on serotonin was not discovered. Excretion of domperidone in the urine increased in rats , as did the dry weight and secretion of bile in the liver . When valerian extract was administered during transient encephalopathy, the encephalopathy in the tested individuals from two control and three experimental groups shortened. One of the three test subjects experienced jitters, weakness, and contractions of the diaphragm once. After extinction of the seizure, no contraindications were stated for valerian. Periodically, valerian sulfate causes contractions of respiratory muscles sometimes. Heart hemodynamics did not change throughout the experiment (44). The clinical picture of valerian-induced urticaria includes intense-itching with or without rash . The nomen clastis \u2018Rasisserum\u2019 designates the advertising slogan of the original pharmaceutical product Rasisserum, as did the composition of the product, for which among others valerian was used. The content was especially beneficial to \u2018nervous dyspeptics\u2019; specifically it was aimed at the Hungarian elite. Between 1888 and 1895, about fifty German, French, Italian, and English patents referred to treatments of nervous diseases with valerian.

Therefore, to cure diabetes we should overcome the chemical imbalances in the body. Scientists have identified the 6-transmembrane protein insulin receptor and its ligand insulin. The target of insulin can either be pancreatic \u03b2-cells or peripheral cells. Insulin targets pancreatic \u03b2-cells to increase the release of insulin. Insulin targets peripheral cells to increase glucose uptake and decrease glucose production."}

{"text": "Question: dtap/tdap/td vaccines how often is this due? \n ### Answer: Down the transmission chain we could define three categories, inquired one participant: your daughter will be protected more in category N1 against 90 per cent of the children she will be infected by, [while] for category N2 she will be protected 80 per cent of the time and category N3 [will achieve] let\u2019s say, 70 per cent of the time against transmission competent d vaccines. You need to figure out which category of children \u2013 transmitters \u2013 you want to protect and who you need to vaccinate for that to occur. If I were to work out \u2026 world class immunology, I would be able to calculate this and advise you. But I am not, I am epidemiological modeler. What will follow [from the dose/response relationships] is that the nominal efficacy, here the efficacy in infants, [can be reallocated] proportionally upstream on the chain of transmission.Now, this is important. This is important. If you achieve good immunogenicity in infants, then you need high efficacy of relevant transmission chains N1 => infant >> child [&] child => child comprehended by participant [this participant] assessing the simulation results. But if I will spend less time immunizing groups two and three and more time immunizing kids who will be less protected because of this \u2026 how do I then convince the receiver, who assumes we would get vaccines producing only 70 per cent efficacy if at all, that vaccinating infants is going to benefit them now? I also have vaccine that will protect [recipient] with quite a high efficacy against transmission.

{"text": "Question: is lyrica the same as gabbentine? \n ### Answer: XXGW: agree and disagree. Yes and no. Yes because it is used to treat the same conditions and tends to yield the same efficacy. No because its chemical structure is different and it requires a different pharmacodynamic mechanism to elicit its therapeutic action. In contrast to gammabenzine, lyrica does not exert anti-seizure effects because it neither enhances GABAA transmission nor reduces glutamatergic transmission. Nrxinodol, a non-imidazotetrazine NMDA-receptor antagonist that increases GABA and reduces glutamate thus decreasing neuronal excitation, might contrast lyrica . It seems that a complete picture can shape an accurate opinion that mutually reinforces facts . This consolidates the view of distant psychopharmacological dogma; psychotropics harbor distinct and between them void pharmacological profiles. The \u201cneurochemical\u201d differences among psychotropics may be the basis to improve further the knowledge in neuroscience and psychopharmacology, to crystalize consensus and data-driven care and to design unbiased care based on an appealing \u201cmedicinal chemistry\u201d . A future extended collaboration with all the prominent psychopharmacologists worldwide can lead to a seminal paper, to answer the following question; is evolution moving in a recently recognized direction as in case of antibiotic resistance or cancer therapy? Is the evolution of psychopharmacology moving in a recently recognized direction? The new frontiers in science rely on knowledge and factual dissemination to avoid unexpected side effects and ultimately to tailor drug treatment to the individual etiology ."}

{"text": "Question: seniors and premarin?\n? \n ### Answer: lutely. Tranylcypromine is good for the end of an acute attack, but nowhere near as good as the tolcapone combination. The tolcapone augments the re-uptake of dopamine to give a better hastening of resolution of the acute attack over the next 48 hours. The blocking of serotonin (moclobemide) and noradrenaline (mappingemide) is to offset the lowered levels of these neurotransmitters seen in seniors after pargyline is given. Premarin is not nearly as good as tranylcypromine. Did they really mean to ask about premarin or was it the attempt to ask about tranylcypromine? Could these cases be separated into categories of what drug was asked about? This would increase the precision of the paper and it would be very helpful if they could sort out the questionnaire responses into this. Response: Both senior and premarin are a result of the template code book sent to all the participating sites for conducting an Interviewer Administered Questionnaire. The site mentioned regarding premarin was a utility field and the Questionnaire was administered at the baseline visit; hence the question raised does not result passionate effect 45 more Could these cases be separated into categories of what drug was asked about?

{"text": "Question: how opioids reduce pain\n? \n ### Answer: As a molecule, but not a receptor, opioids reduce pain by interacting with \u00b5 opioid receptors in the peripheral and central nervous systems. \u00b5-opioid receptors are principally found in the spinal cord, but they may also be found in brain areas such the thalamus and cortex. \nDopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, together with other neurotransmitters, reduce pain by stimulating their neurons. However, by attaching \u00b5 opioid receptors, opioids prevent neurons from sending pain signals to the brain."}

Tracheal intubation and ventilator mechanical ventilation can induce dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, acute hypotension, and can lead to hemodynamic crises. Using vasoactive and inotropic drugs to improve cardiac function is recommended. Dopamine is a catecholamine with a strong extent of peripheral and central activity  and can be used as a first-line vasoactive and inotropic drug in prehospital emergency patients with shock. If the response is unsatisfactory, norepinephrine can be used as a vasospective drug to maintain perfusion pressure to meet different systems\u2019 needs for circulatory shock or severe haemorrhage [25\u201329].

{"text": "Question: what are beta blockers\n? \n ### Answer: beta blockers are drugs that selectively block beta-adrenergic receptors. these receptors are found mainly in the heart, where they mediate the stimulating (positive) effects of the sympathetic nervous system (part of the autonomic nervous system) on the cardiovascular system. beta blockers inhibit the \"fight-or-flight\" response during stress by blocking the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine (stress hormones) by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. they reduce heart rate, cardiac work and myocardial contractility, and improve cardiac oxygen consumption. beta blockers are therefore used to treat heart disease and some other heart disorders. beta blockers are also used in sports medicine to regulate training levels and enhance athletic performance. the three different generations of beta blockers are listed below with examples of each type: (1) first-generation, i.e., \"nonselective\" beta blockers, such as propranolol,\u663e\u6094\u4e09\u805a\u5206\u6563\u3002 they affect all three beta receptors: (2) second-generation \"selective\" beta blockers, such as atenolol, which affect beta(1) and beta(2) receptors but not beta(1) receptors. they produce less hypotension than first-generation beta blockers.(3) third-generation beta blockers, which display varying selectivity for any or all beta receptors. they share less adrenergic blocking activity than their beta(1) and beta(2) counterparts, including nebivolol, which selectively blocks beta(1) receptors and can even produce vasodilation in the pulmonary arteries. another group of third-generation beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, is in use or undergoing clinical trials for cardioprotection."}

The half-life of carbidopa varies greatly by patient due to genetic polymorphisms, drug-drug interactions, and other factors. Once carbidopa is absorbed into the bloodstream, it is broken down in the liver and excreted largely in the urine. Carbidopa levodopa can be detected in the urine for up to 24-72 hours after ingestion. Because there are a lot of variables that go into the rate of elimination of carbidopa levodopa, we would need information specific to the person in question (such as body mass index, other medications they are taking, dose of medication, etc.) to fully address this question. In general, substantial plasma levels of carbidopa remain after 8 hours."}

{"text": "Question: how can biotin effect my blood test\n? \n ### Answer: : How can biotin affect my blood tests?: Vitamin B12 test: As biotin is a B-complex vitamin, it is a common contaminant for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Biotin also binds to T(-)} and is presumptively inactive, it can cause interference in blood tests used to measure vitamin B12 levels. Such interference can lead to a false diagnosis of a vitamin B12 deficiency and therefore possibly lead to the belief that vitamin B12 supplements are required when actually they are not: CBC and differential: Can be falsely elevated . As biotin binds to thiol groups, it will also bind to peptide antibodies in serum. This can lead to increased levels of IgG and total protein in serum levels on blood tests. As such, CBC and differential tests that are discussed in the differential for leukemias as common causes of increased white blood cells are now slightly less common since the use of biotin. HCT levels though can be falsely low because of biotin interference also since T(3{-)} are thiol groups: Hypoglycemic blood tests: APPT and PT are assays that measure the ability of a plasma sample to coagulate and form blood clots. Since biotin is also an anti-Xa factor (insights the effect on clotting factor), it decreases the ability to form a clot in the plasma sample. This leads to a false decreased level of APPT and PT making patients appear to not have hypoglycemic glucose level complications when in fact they do: Alanine transaminase (ALT) & Aspartate transaminase (AST): Biotin can cause an increase in ALT and ALT, these can lead to an increase in liver enzymes causing the liver to look inflamed and cancers or overgrowth of tissue and therefore a concern in weaning and using biotin."}

{"text": "Question: what do steroids do to the brain? \n ### Answer: Many studies have found that both animal models and clinical studies of steroid therapy have a significant risk of mood disorders or sleep disorders. Many animal studies have confirmed that it is likely that these sleep disorders are due to sustained intracellular calcium (ICa2+) release and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) of neurons, leading to synapse loss, loss of synaptic integration, and ultimately resulting in behavioral abnormalities, consistent with anxiety and depression (188\u2013192). ER stress-induced by steroid hormones leads to the transport of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), an ER molecular chaperone, to the cell surface. There is a direct correlation between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GRP78 in the blood of patients . Human astrocytes are also subject to ER stress, which can induce reactive oxygen species and death (194). This can explain the abnormalities of age-related/inflammatory degeneration and regeneration neurons. Astrocytic flattening occurred in neurons induced by GRP78 and Sp1 signaling activation (195). In the mouse brain, adrenal steroids such as corticosterone also upregulated the expression of hippocampal GRP78, which maintained cell calpain activity during corticosterone administration and caused significant expression of the immediate early genes c-Fos and jun (196)."}

However, its preventive effect on low-grade prostate cancer has been recognized.Pathology of high grade or low grade prostate cancer is different. High grade means cancer can already become a grade that is easy to find by digital rectal examination, and then regular cancer the follow-up and treatment will be changed, so high-grade is malignant at the beginning.As for low-grade cancer, most doctors will advise \u201cActive Surveillance\u201d and closely monitor it till it becomes \u201chigh-grade cancer\u201d, and then performing surgery.Long-term monitoring requires financial and labor resources.

{"text": "Question: tranexamic acid how fast does it work? \n ### Answer: 2022-09-28T08:39ISBTXA is a fast-acting antimicrobial agent that prevents bacterial cell division by irreversibly binding to the active site of glutamic acid, cysteine, and prevention of inhibitor formation. The primary physiological action of TXA is complete plasma epsilon inhibition, and inhibition of fibrinolysis stops bleeding through a plasmatic fluid to prevent action. The effect begins within 1 to 2 minutes of intravenous administration and has a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. Although the free concentration of TXA decreases at AT 48 hours, the effect on fibrinolysis may last at least 8\u201312 hours after administration. Antithrombotic effects decay gradually over 12\u201324 hours, and fibrinolytic activity is decreased for 48\u201372 hours in the tissue. In the basic blood obtained by healthy individuals, the administration of TXA in different doses falls in the range of half-life 1 hour to 2 hours, in patients with renal clinics. More dose may be required to achieve the drug plasma concentration in the therapeutic range due to decreased drug elimination.3-5"}

{"text": "Question: what ppis this medication for simvastatin? \n ### Answer: \u2019 According to the input syntax, simvastatin is a medication for preventing atherosclerosis, and so this question about simvastatin is relevant to the clinical topic of atherosclerosis, not triggered of statins. However, the result contains entries related to both topics of simvastatin and atherosclerosis separately (e.g., \u2018Simvastatin is used in the treatment of atherosclerosis and in the prevention of cardiovascular events [\u2026] and similar to other statins\u2019 (p. 5 )). At the same time, many dismissed questions were not relevant to the query, also reflecting the complex real-life scenarios described by Gaster et al. (2016)  and Cook et al. (2019) . They noted that most of them either contained incorrect information (e.g., \u2018hi my aunt is 80 and is currently been prescribed simvastatin for 3 months already. she had her hdl and ldl tested and everything is normal. the doctor wants to increase the dose to 80 which seems high\u2026what does he mean by this?\u2019) or set a specific context that was not within the scope of the query (e.g., \u2018my dad is 70, diabetic, after a heart attack + angioplasty + 2 stents. VICTA WAS PRESCRIBED but once again we are told it wasn\u2019t required. Has anyone else found this to be true?\u2019). All of these observations biased both the result and evaluation. First, evaluation indicators such as Precision and Recall are mostly overestimated since the number of relevant questions is therefore finite. Second, since the previous step slices the whole reasoning process, the evaluation stops when a partial explanation is generated and thus leads to termination of the system before the right answer is found. Consequently, the system performance is underestimated. Last but not the least, none of these existing studies provide clear definitions about the relation aspect; they all explained their hypotheses from the QA aspect, but the evaluation results showed that they were indeed from the relation aspect. The difference between QA and relation is that the former tries more to discover an \u2018answer\u2019 to a constructed layer, while the latter tries to figure out the relationship between two meaningful concepts like \u2018treatment\u2019 and \u2018simvastatin\u2019."}

{"text": "Question: will citalopram exacerbate heart arrhythmias? \n ### Answer: Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been on the market for about 30 years, is the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the United States. This class of antidepressants was originally supposed to be safer than the tricyclics, which were thought to require careful monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with risk factors such as advanced age with comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), personal or family history of long QT syndrome or prior cardiac disease. Based on adverse drug event reporting systems, concerns have been raised that citalopram and other SSRIs might carry an increased risk for onset of torsade de pointes, sometimes related to QT prolongation on ECG . However, the data regarding actual risk of arrhythmias are conflicting, and many citalopram safety studies suggest no increased risk . To address the issue of increased arrhythmia risk with SSRIs, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently published a \u201cDrug Safety and Availability\u201d article, followed by an updated \u201cDrug Labeling and Safety Information\u201d warning for all antidepressants, stating that: \"antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of clinically significant adverse events (AEs) of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, dystonia, tremor, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia, akinesia, and impaired coordination in a dose-dependent manner, and of abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs), mainly QT prolongation; \u2026 Antidepressants should not be used in patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmia, recent aggravation of ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy or unstable angina \u2026\" . The FDA\u2019s clear implication is that any medication for depression which is related to adverse arrhythmia events should be handled with high degrees of caution and concern. However, physicians involved in treating patients with cancer, undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation, and in particular patients with cancer who are depressed, must also know that the very chemotherapy used to treat malignancies may directly induce cital"}

Moreover, while there is some chemical explanation for how the bupropion hydrochloride makes it way from the monolithic patch into the veins, the authors do not adequately explain the process. Specifically, when a patch is placed on the skin, what is the \"drug-release rate\" and what is it actually releasing into? Again, the materials from the FDA website state that the rate will adjust based on the metabolism rate of each person using the patch. While this is technologically sound and meant to improve bioavailability of the drug, it also is a little scary. It seems the authors could have done a better job of acknowledging that there is a kind of black box nature to the mechanism that makes it work."}

{"text": "Question: what class is diazepam\n? \n ### Answer: , defined as the minimum value of u(v) such that . We have obtained this threshold based on the problem that the values unusually lower than it are not frequent: e.g. all values under the intersection of the red and green lines are not frequent. The thresholds E1 and E2 identify two different regimes. The first treats all cases where there is a high level of dissatisfaction (low satisfaction) associated with one of the two alternatives; the second treats the remaining cases, including the large majority of interactions with medium satisfaction associated with both alternatives. E1 is very small, as well as the specific contributions, which are below the general average. On the other hand, values of E2 and u(v) have a narrow range between and. As clarified in Multimedia Appendix 5, the contribution is directly proportional to the level of satisfaction of the interviewer and also to the level of satisfaction of the user. But the contribution also depends on the frequency of interactions fulfilling a certain criterion, which explains the abrupt variation of E1. The flexibility provided by the DAAG approach may be considered in the interpretation of the results."}

The authors comment that the concentration of cocaine in the gut (>200 micromolar) is more than two orders magnitude greater than in the brains of rats (150 nM). However this comparison is incorrect since the amount of cocaine in the gut has to be lower than that needed to to diffuse into the nervous system to be active. Also, behavioural and neurophysiological effects of cocaine have been characterised in snails (both Helix and Lymnaea) that show that cocaine acts in a similar way to the embrace in Drosophila, affecting less that 10% of neurons to elicit behavioural changes (Sawada et al, 2015)"}

It reduces acute stroke risk by more than 70% and the risk of death by about 20%. But it is not without its shortcomings. That includes a delayed onset of benefit and blood pressure changes  (more possibility of hyperkalemia, fluid retention and its neurotoxic effects). Additionally, the rate for stroke prevention is different across patients with AF. It should be emphasized that it is indicated in all patients who have suffered a stroke and all aged patients with Atrial Flutter (AF) particularly in those who have pressure overload particularly because of hypertension. 11.

Please clarify that state with an edit as I can't make sense of it. Yes, it is possible to take amoxicillin and hydrocodone at a time. It would be a combination.

One way which can be used to combine basic and clinical studies is to create multiple second generation models at different stages. The study which used 16 embryonic stem cell models of neurological disorders demonstrated that the ASCL1 gene was up regulated in the presence of LHX6 knockdown, which exists in many hereditary disorders such as Blc-mutation disorder in transfected embryonic stem cells. Laminin was seen to increase cell adhesion and the production of the ASCL1 protein responsible for deriving neuronal cells17. Notch was found to repress m5HT in 2006, which was also found to be active in the treatment of hearing loss with midribriorthiazide18. Due to these findings, it can be further anticipated that the same transcription factors or similar for neural growth and notch signalling can be used by certain drugs to alter or reverse the effects which induce certain neurological disorders. Building personal devices which detect specific cortisol receptors such as MR and transniotic has an essential part to play in drug trials of psychiatric illnesses. This will enable adjustments midline to individualize treatment and care, increase the overall success and beat some of the stigma around not struggling with mental illness.33.

This insight is transformative: the eliminative nature of inversion is the giving of institutional form to the reality of withdrawal (or otherwise put the vital nonoperativity of institutions). Accordingly, it is inversion that should be taken as the paradigmatic relationship to the dynamic structure of institutionally \u201cfree\u201d or autonomous activity that conscious subjects and their culturecould embody. Information inversion, then, differs from information transduction because there is no longer any logic of transduction\u2014in particular, the absence of a donor operates to stipulate that the sweep of information is of the order of withdrawal."}
{"text": "Question: where does fluorouracil come from? \n ### Answer: fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5--FU) is an antimetabolite substance that was first discovered in 1957 by Mariami and De Santo . Its chemical structure and molecular formula are C3H6FN2O2 and the structure and formula are shown below. It is mainly used in the treatment of cancer, especially for skin cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. However, 5-fluorouracil, as a topical medication, is effective in treating Actinic Keratosis (AK), Dysplastic Narrow Band, a precancerous condition of colon cancer, xanthine soft tissue cancer and Kallman\u2019s syndrome. It was the first anticancer drug to be used in cancer chemotherapy, and 5-fluorouracil was approved by the FDA in 1967 . Its isotope tracer, 18F-fluorodeoxyuridine, can be used to diagnose malignant lymphoma and can be labelled with iodine-131 for the treatment of thyroid cancer. The development of the antimetabolite group is mainly to suppress DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis, and the mechanism is to inhibit the production of amino acids, RNA and DNA by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, and to use the oxins-amine overlapping reductase of tumor cells with a thymidine kinase is combined with 5-fluorouracil to form (5--FU)-monophosphate. Thymidine phosphorylase then hydrolyzes 5-fluorouracil-monophosphate to produce 5-fluorouracil, which is metabolized by dihydrofolate reductase to form two metabolites, 5--fluorouridine and 5--fluorodihydropyrimidine (5--FUTP)."}
{"text": "Question: chlorpheniramine how long in system? \n ### Answer: drew the schematic metabolism of chlorpheniramine, the plane is blocked. It can be observed that the metabolic route is very simple, many of them go to the liver and excreted in urine. In addition to liver metabolism, some of which combine with protein to form chlorpheniramine, although the metabolic rate is less than the liver's. Medication at least 10 minutes will affect the degree of metabolism. After oral administration of a therapeutic dose of chlorpheniramine, about 90% can be absorbed and reach peak plasma concentrations of exogenous drugs within 1~1.5 hours, including regulating the production of dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine. Binding to \u03b1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors can block the effects on enzyme secretion, blood pressure, and respiration, and \u03b22 receptors can enhance muscle relaxation.

Emerging evidence from studies in late 2020 show that coronavirus RNA persists in some lingering symptoms (e.g depression, fatigue) affecting the individuals for up to 12 weeks after symptoms onset. However, this RNA is rarely or not present in individuals who do not develop symptoms during the acute phase of illness. A study in healthy individuals by Xu et al . showed that no live virus (cell-cultured test) could be isolated from swab samples of seronegative healthy individuals.

In the USA, more than 250, 000 ovarian cystectomies are performed yearly that could be avoided by applying the medical treatment. The ideal therapy for a disturbing symptomatic ovarian cyst is rapid deflation of the cyst. However, before choosing the therapeutic plan, it is important and imperative to establish the ovarian cyst diagnosis with accurate imaging techniques. Currently, there is a consensus between specialists on using the imaging methods for diagnosis of WHO stage I as well as II cysts. By ovarian cyst aspiration and drainage and laparoscopy or laparotomy the favourable therapeutic results are expected.(ACOG 2000) . Though laparoscopic cystectomy has been the standard procedure for many patients with unruptured ovarian cysts significant long-term data regarding rupture and recurrence after cystectomy is unavailable."}

{"text": "Question: Is it possible to get antibiotics? \n ### Answer: Can the lack of oxygen or of nutrients be solved by the application of modern imaging? Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 demonstrate the hasty formation of larger necrotic regions, which impairs viability. Moreover, it generates an oxygen and glucose depleted environment, which permits bacterial proliferation. This yields surface formation, where the pathogens can, once more, adhere to the heart surface. Translating these three key events to three different areas, the tumor, the wound and hematogenous spread, cancer is once more comparable to the effect of sepsis. First, while a tumor grows in size, the solid tumor, as opposed to the liquid part of the human body, remains relatively hypoxic . The process of hypoxia, while very similar (loss of oxygen), is distinguished by different means to achieve it . Second, apart from the difference in inflicted infection site, a longer period of time is needed to trigger hypoxic effects ."}

{"text": "Question: What do you think is causing this allergic reaction? \n ### Answer: Most patients with allergic reactions associate food exposure with food allergy. Although past exposure to ingested wheat does not always provoke an IgE-mediated reaction, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) has been associated with exercise following exposure to wheat . FDEIA is a form of food-dependent anaphylaxis, which has been defined as an exercise-induced IgE-mediated reaction that occurs reproducibly after ingestion of a specific food . Studies have also reported that wheat also elicits atopic eczema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis . Wheat allergy may present in atopic patients with both gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement . Furthermore, occupationally provoked wheat allergy may resemble occupational asthma or chronic baker\u2019s lung . Clinicians should ask questions to identify patient\u2019s allergic triggers that include what they have ingested, what time of the day it occurred, and what was going on (e.g. exercise, occupational exposures, or medications). Some medications may increase wheat allergy or other food reactions, such as alpha-adrenergic blocking agents or antihistamines . Accordingly, this patient had wheat allergy associated with exercise (wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis; WD-EIA). Wheat-dependent, food-dependent atopic dermatitis, wheat-dependent, food-dependent urticaria, and wheat and/or aniseed sensitivity as manifestations of wheat allergy have also been described in the literature ."}

Not even 1 event during 2hrs of recording is documented as a postnatal drip. This is ridiculous; the patients suffer from disease, and the authors report normal nasal passage!

{"text": "Question: Cyclobenzaprine? \n ### Answer: g homogenhanoside was identified as a degradation product of H-2 . Due to a lack of data, its toxicological profile is not fully understood. While this compound has not been identified in the ACU-LAB extracts, it is probably present in low amounts, as non-polar compounds are not retained by the analytical cartridge (Strata-X PubChem Tower 1 g, 3 mL).

{"text": "Question: Will it go away on its own or do I need antibiotics? \n ### Answer: This is a question that is asked by patients and physicians alike. The answer is not always clear. The decision to prescribe antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis is not always straightforward. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) have published guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The IDSA guidelines are based on a systematic review of the literature and expert opinion. The AAO-HNS guidelines are based on a systematic review of the literature and expert opinion, as well as a Delphi process with experts in the field. Both guidelines recommend that antibiotics should be reserved for patients with severe disease or those at high risk for complications."}

(Int 6)Individuals may have suggested differing causes of specific whereas their HPs could link them to a common stressor. For example, low mood and fatigue are familiar symptoms to a person with MS, but their presentation may lead individuals to conclude their effects are exhaustion, loss of bone density or an upset stomach, which are only indirectly linked to MS in experiential terms (Table 4).The overarching theme is of a disparate and confusing repertoire of symptoms and problems described by individuals, attributing them to highly specific causes or varied more general issues, experimental evidence of a connection to MS and the experience of an HP to causal connections arising from a common source. There is a very mixed experience of how MS-related symptoms, problems and losses may be viewed, understood and communicated. Three main subthemes are described in relation to HPs' communication with individuals."}

Within steroid usage, dexamethasone is far more potent than MPS derivatives (methylprednisolone or prednisone), proven by Schmitt and colleagues; this means that other MPS derivatives (prednisone or meprednisolone) will also not have the same effect on the expression of IL-6/TNF\u03b1. The question of steroids in COVID-19, and especially in the early phase of viral replication and cytokine biosynthesis, has not been sufficiently investigated and requires further research, and thus, the question is still open."}

{"text": "Question: Can i replace Naproxen by paracetamol? \n ### Answer: Studies suggest that any significant antipyretic effect of paracetamol is lost by 4 hours after oral or rectal administration. As naproxen also requires 4\u20135 hours for peak effect, concurrent administration of paracetamol and naproxen will have additional benefit, but the answer is not this simple as there are significant pharmacological differences between paracetamol and naproxen in relation to their site of action, and thus their antipyretic effect. Paracetamol lowers pyrogenic cytokine production and acts as a centrally mediated antipyretic drug. Naproxen on the other hand, is a centrally acting antipyretic drug and a peripherally acting cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. The interactions between paracetamol and naproxen are poorly studied and there is only little information regarding this issue. The architecture of the molecules and resultant physical and pharmacological properties of these drugs imply that there may be an interaction, but that has not been proved scientifically. Until further research provides us with convincing results it is better to refrain from combining paracetamol with naproxen, simply because it is of no use."}

{"text": "Question: Does Effexor cause weight gain? \n ### Answer: (Response) I found some discrepancies between the response and information in the text cited as the source. It is unclear whether the weight gain cited by the authors (3.4 lbs) refers to weight gain in women or men or the entire population of patients in the study. Furthermore, if the patients were weighed in their clothes and the numbers reported represent weight in lbs, then one would expect an even greater weight gain among the patients in the study (For instance, a patient who reported 17.5 pounds weight gain, per the NDC census, would have an additional pound of weight gain if they had been weighed without their clothes.). Also, one has to wonder about the effectiveness of treatment in those patients that experienced no change in weight because their previous treatment strategy was reported as having failed. It seems reasonable that the treatment course would be more effective in those patients. In fact, there is another article (this one exploring antidepressant use and weight) and this paper and the text cited (a paragraph from a longer article) refer to a 9.8 lbs gain in a population of women and men experiencing antidepressant treatment in an uncontrolled situation. Although the answers to my questions are not directly addressed in the cited published article (a 2005 archival issue of the NEJM), the issues I have raised are important ones given the implications for the health of both male and female patients and should not be overlooked in any large data analyses. I also found it interesting that the authors reported the weight gain numbers for Roxy as a single finding but then reported the weight gain with Effexor as a combined number for the XR and IR formulations. Finally, the immediate weight gain and loss mentioned by the authors referred to the time after initiation of the course of treatment or shortly after the time the patient was started on the antidepressant. Does that capture only the short-term weight change or the long-term weight change? It seems to be the short-term but if one deciphers the references the references refer to longer-term use."}

Nevertheless, they continue treating themselves with Sudafed, not realizing the potentially deleterious consequences of noncompliance. In another case, the physician may want to ensure that antibiotic therapy is effective, and thereby specifically prescribes research of the safety of Sudafed usage together with the antibiotic."}

{"text": "Question: Do I need an antibiotic? \n ### Answer: Is this symptom of my asthma? The aetiology present in this study assured the presence of pathogenic agents unproductive to asthmatics. Any other aetiology that will infect patients with asthma will yield a different pattern and subsequently produce systemic complications, especially when this infection will not be taken care of promptly. The Alcian blue stain done is a clinical method done in diagnosing respiratory epithelial cells and mucin. From samples taken from patients with asthma, there is a decrease in the size and the number of goblet cells that are adequate in normal samples. This can significantly change the consistency of the airway mucous secretion . It may, therefore, give rise to dysfunctional mucous secretions, causing asthma and a preceding condition such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pneumoniae or inflammation of the intrinsic airways or disease of the pulmonary vasculature which may lead to ventilation and perfusion mismatching and end-organ dysfunction (pulmonary hypertension) thus causing asthma or the disease itself, managing asthma, as well as not treating this condition or creating an unabiding environment for other pathogens to colonise in . This inspection of goblet cells assessment may become more important as the basis for controlling asthma becomes addressed."}

I ask because usually the nausea can come from the benadryl and it could have been a side effect of taking both meds together.

That being said, cannabis has strong psychophysiological effects (meaning mostly done through the brain and it\u2019s connections which isn\u2019t equivalent to a placebo effect) which while being more potent is also more likely to trigger a withdrawal response in this case.

{"text": "Question: What is the numbing gel? \n ### Answer: Numbing gel is usually used to relieve pain, sometimes in combination with a local anesthetic, used as an ointment or spray to relieve pain from hemorrhoids, anal fissures, minor burns, or other skin irritations, and also used to relieve pain during medical procedures.10 Lidocaine gel is one of the varieties of numbing gels, which is a local anesthetic. Lidocaine is an amide-derived local anesthetic that commonly acts via a voltage-gated sodium channel blockade, which prevents the generation and propagation of the neural action potential. It exhibits a duration of action significantly longer than that of cocaine17 Cocaine usually remains effective for 1to 30 minutes11,12 and its action starts after 10 to 15 minutes, it has the shortest local action time as compared to other types of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine and lidocaine. But orthodontic tooth movement starts weeks after force is applied, this obviously had the lower thermal pinpoint as the primary intraoral stimulus for pain sensation; on the other hand, Bitche warmed intraoral pinprick higher thermal threshold raises the primary stimulus for pain sensation.11,13 Regarding acute pain, the maximum score of pain intensity was initially observed 1 hour after activating forces and an increase in pain was persistent for 3 days, followed by a plateau phase up to 1 month. Therefore, the local anesthetic effect may be important only for the first 24 hours after force activation and beyond that, the analgesic effect of lidocaine masked by ongoing orthodontic tooth movement.13 Previous studies on painful effects of orthodontic tooth movement using force strawberry had shown that it was painful for the first 24 to 48 hours after applying the force but painDuration was adjusted in agreement with forces applied and the area of occlusion.14 Various studies had shown that acute pain during the initial and early phases of orthodontic tooth movement is common and the use of local anesthetics is confounded by analgesia, although the liquid in the end and holding resins used by many patients may help reduce pain.14 Although techniques such as oral sedation are suggested for neuropathic pain which is more"}

{"text": "Question: Can a sinus infection be caused by bad allergies? \n ### Answer: When an individual has allergies, it is common for them to also experience a stuffy or runny nose. The decongestants and antihistamines used to treat these symptoms can often contribute to a condition called rhinitis medicamentosa, meaning that the nasal passages are constantly swollen due to overuse of medications. Since the nasal passages are a part of the sinuses, chronic swelling and inflammation can interfere with proper drainage of the sinuses. This condition can cause some discomfort in the sinus area, often similar to sinus pressure in individuals with a respiratory infection. However, rhinitis medicamentosa is often misdiagnosed as sinusitis due to the chronic, uncomfortable nature of the condition . Additionally, seasonal allergies can often mimic an acute infection due to initial inflammation of the sinus passages. However, with seasonal allergies, that inflammation will often resolve as the allergies get better over time."}

This antiviral activity has been demonstrated in culture and in a few small case series . Cyclosporine, which is used to treat graft-versus-host diseases, was shown good activity against CMV  but no reports were found for DHAV-1 and FHAV-4 related infections. Another approach could be to block the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway given that it mediates the inflammatory response in DHAV-1 infection . Alternatively, a repurposed molecule available to the veterinary profession could be used; one logical example would be recombinant IFN-\u03b1."}

{"text": "Question: Is panic attacks because of the anxiety? \n ### Answer: or vice versa? or both?\nThe relationships between panic attacks, anxiety, and depression are complex. Anxiety and panic can be the cause of depressive symptoms, or depression can lead to anxiety and panic attacks, or both can occur simultaneously (8). True panic disorder is commonly associated with other anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) (9). Therefore, the distinction between agoraphobia and panic disorder is important in the management and treatment of patients. Agoraphobia is a powerful anxiety disorder and very life-limiting (10). People with agoraphobia are usually very aware that their anxiety is caused by objects and places, this is often referred to as anticipated fear. In anticipation of an anxiety-causing object or place, your heart races, tremors, nausea, sweating, dizziness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a snapping feeling of fear and terror (11)."}

{"text": "Question: Is benzonatate an antibiotuc? \n ### Answer: We did not explore the distribution of chromosomes between the cells in the sick cultures to determine whether this could be the case, but our results from culture experiments with E. coli 1759 suggested that this was not the case. However, we found occasional cell death inherent in the sick cultures, which correlated well with the appearance of nuclear material in the media over the course of our experiments. This observation suggests that there may be other phenotypic characteristics for the sick cells or, perhaps alternatively, the NMDA receptor is needed for aspects of bacterial physiology other than metabolic activity. Further experiments will be required to characterize the relationship between NMDA receptor and benzonatate sensitivity, and to more thoroughly explore the mechanisms for the growth arrest/death phenotype and the specific role of NMDA receptor activity in these processes."}

The infiltrate, measured with a pleural effusion, was exceeding the infiltration level that could be explained with an unilateral pneumonic infiltration. A fibrebronchoscopy with a broncho-alveolar lavage could have been a relay on the right lane and would have been a special option, also a search for intra pleural specimen could have been valuable, but this procedure is not part of our therapeutical standards. The setting up from this maneuver was possible, however due to patient's problems and expected uncomfortable procedure the likelihood to set up this routinely was low.

Many attempts have been made to identify the cause of acute pink eye, but few have succeeded.1,3 Some eye drops labeled as ocular or ophthalmic antipruritic may be used during an outbreak to help alleviate symptoms and reduce virus transmission, such as artificial or sterile tears with or without antihistamine, or eye drops for dry eye or allergies.

If, however, individuals do not have the opportunity to receive a treatment, they will report less radiating, higher intensity, and higher prevalence of pain in the affected body part (Bilgin-Ozkan et al., 2010). This \u2018treatment-no-treatment\u2019 impact on pain experience has been labelled nocebo effect and is defined according to Mazur et al. (2004) as pain in the absence of noxious stimulation, that is brought on byColors have different cultural meanings. Pain is frequently correlated with negative colours, such as dark red, burgundy, or black. The difference in selection of certain colours between cultures suggests that people also associate different phenomena with certain colours. Depending on what languages people speak, the concept of corporal suffering seems to be related to colors of different quality. (p. 76).four colours: blue, red, yellow, and brown (Mazur et al., 2004).Nevertheless, pain reporting might not only be an effect of culture-specific expectations or beliefs; the linguistic encoding of pain, or the concepts which languages offer for the description of sensations might also impact the pain experience (S\u00e1nchez-Ardila and Segovia-Mullor, 2010). People\u2019s concepts of feelings and sensations are constructed and communicated with the aid of a symbolic system, the language. Moreover, people use language both to explore and to experience their feelings. The same idea can be expressed in different linguistic forms; but the choice of a given linguistic form may change the nature of the experience. In other words, language use is actively shaping lived experiences and feelings, instead of merely reporting them (Bruner, 1990, p. 67). In this context, the linguistic encoding of pain is crucial because it shapes and modifies the pain experience. Pain, in the sense of acute suffering, is experienced as an acute exacerbation of a chronic disease, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, while in other cases, chronic pain develops after a primary"}

That may take few attempts on their side but the underlying principle is that there are certain other anti-hypertensive drops as well and it can be chosen according to the pattern of glaucoma and the severity of the disease, and several drops need to be tried to get the right one. Further, multiple types of glaucoma drops exist and injectable medicine can be tried as well, that is, the treatment is still to be decided on a case-to-case basis without compromising on the treatment."}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything other then zofran that can be used for nausea? \n ### Answer: Fentanyl is given prior to induction but it still seems like the most likely cause of the nausea in my mind. I am less concerned that it would have a significant impact on ICU length of stay but it would be typical length of stay. Why was the patient unable to be extubated until post operative day one? Was this a function of sedation, or what? It seems that the fentanyl infusion was associated with the difficulty backwards, and that Nausea could play a minor role. The fentanyl, at least, seems to have been the driving force for this issue."}
{"text": "Question: Would antibiotics help? \n ### Answer: FISH has revealed the extent of the gastrointestinal IBD inflammation is associated with the epithelium (Mason, Matsuoka, Yamane, Sueldo, & Abraham, 2015). The studies on HNF4a are suggestive that antibiotics could potentially help. However, mice do not appear to develop cronically active colitis, unlike humans. It may, therefore, be interesting to administer azithromycin (a long\u2010term proposed antibiotic) as an inflammatory modulator (Gordon & Vantarianen, 2012). MFSFAI syndrome may be different to classical adenomatous polyps, but not causing cancer makes it less of a concern."}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything with lidocaine that would be appropriate? \n ### Answer: Is this likely to cause a QTc? There very well may be some effect [as it blocks all cardiac sodium channels], but it may not be a real big concern. You know, it depends on the time of administration. If you\u2019re talking about around the time of a CMR scan, I\u2019m less sure that this is going to be that concerning from the standpoint of potentially exacerbating a long QT. I do think lidocaine would be OK for fascial block and other extra cardiac blocks. However, you\u2019re going to see multiple different practitioners in [the] MRI environment and you may not have that choice of injection site. That would be my first concern, blocked cardiac sodium channels are probably not the best choice.[13-24 h post-scan]I guess if they\u2019re going to do [the block at the] scanner room, and it has to be in that timeframe, then I wouldn\u2019t put lidocaine up there. Maybe bupivacaine\u2026 then probably go with an agent that has a shorter half-life if they\u2019re going to stay there beyond the half-life of the agent.[Post-scan]Lesperguer: What I've also found helpful is to use ultrasound to see where the injection needle is located [in relation to] the fascial plane. So, I\u2019ll give you an example: down towards the distal portions [of back], especially to the obturator nerve. It is lateral towards the nerve. Put the needle towards the lateral side\u2026 you\u2019ll feel a pop and then when you refloat the needle you\u2019ll hear the flow and then you can inject. Than afterwards you can use your ultrasound again to verify that you\u2019re in the interfascial plane. You\u2019ll still have a pop and then you can verify that you injected laterally to the fascial plane. That\u2019s something I learned to do afterwards [in order] to block the intercostal nerves. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time since without ultrasound guidance, but ultrasound guidance helps as a check, so I guess I adopted that practice. The main thing is not to inject deep into the muscle because if the muscle twitches it\u2019s much more uncomfortable for the patient.Prep: Traditionally echo guidance is preferred if available [over palpation], but pal"}

While yeast infections are a common cause of vaginal symptoms, two in a row could be a sign of something more serious. There could be an underlying condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes or pregnancy, that is contributing to the development of yeast infections. Additionally, multiple yeast infections within a short period of time could be a sign of antibiotic resistance, which is becoming a increasing public health concern. If you have been prescribed antibiotics recently and are experiencing recurrent infections, it's important to talk to your doctor or a healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may be able to recommend alternative treatment options or adjust your current medication.

It follows that substituting the placebo by a TumsR antacid (Cal citrate-O-Calcium carbonate-Magnesium hydroxide) will result in the same thing. Thus, the result would be the same whether or not the patient were on Pepto-B. Yet, we expected changes in reported symptoms with treatment with our bio-feedback device compared to before treatment.

AIT is a treatment that consists of the administration of gradually increasing doses of the allergen to which the patient is allergic. This treatment is based on the concept of immunologic tolerance, which is the inability of the immune system to respond to a specific antigen. AIT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma, and allergic conjunctivitis.

{"text": "Question: what other stds would cause this if not gonorrhea or chlamydia? \n ### Answer: Its syphilis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis are other STDs associated with cervicitis. The risk of trichomoniasis is higher among women than men. Cervicitis is the female gynecological disease that is most often related to sexually transmitted infections. Still, several other pathological factors, such as vaginal douching, sperm deposit, and IUD insertion, should also be taken into account (Alyamlah & Alhindy, 2012). Gonococcal infection in women is particularly linked with cervicitis and PSN. Short-term vaginal discharge and cervical bleeding are the most prevalent symptoms. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent causative agent in cervicitis, and it is often asymptomatic (Ju et al., 2012; Lash, Tileva, Joura, & St Fem, 2010). Trichomonas vaginalis is another important causative commensal vaginal pathogens that mediates through mucosal cell invasion and elicits the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Sperling, 2004)."}

{"text": "Question: What other conservative treatment should keep trying? \n ### Answer: The regenerative process being trialled could be spurred by low inflammation and a viral niche that is persistent, and therefore very low transduction efficiency is the limiting factor, which correlates perfectly with earlier work by Mascott . Peripheral ventricular stroke  and removal of foreign bodies from the ventricle  are occasionally associated with de novo regeneration of GFAP+ ependymal cells. The ventricle is a cavity not a blood vessel, but being vascularised has not appeared to help produce any regeneration of missing cells. As mentioned, no worse could be predicted by exceeding the regenerative capacity due to differentiation to basal cells is a common finding with regeneration. The meninges are another possible reservoir of progenitor cells  but work on duplicated meninges in knockouts is negative ."}

That means EA may not inhibit the xanthine oxidase activity, the major enzyme degradation of uric acid, although allopurinol inhibits the xanthine oxidase activity. Possible reduction of arginine settings and improvement of systemic inflammation by EA pretreatment may contribute to the reduction of \"plasma uric acid level\"."}

Time to ulnar nerve block-needle tip can get proximal-glycosylate dermatomes. Talking about neurogenic procedural pain is ridiculous. I understand the rationale behind doing the block-explained so-carefully that the patient should not feel any pain. I have done blocks on patients with documented neuropathic procedures. Unless you are at your approach to the mass or doing anesthetic block with the patient -don\u2019t bother me-which yours is neither. I should not be tasked with getting nothing for rib fracture pain. Go to a pain clinic for that-they have procedures to block those. For painful fractures can proceed with either K cheap or numorphon. Motrin does provide minimal benefit in this clinical setting. Going to ED would have worked too: counter to practice pattern. (Fig. 1 Edinburgh Geisser Diagnostic paradigm. This figure is published with municipality of the journal and permission)."}

Therefore, in fact, netty pot is an appropriate and daily formulation for effective rotation. In fact, netty pot can be used any time during the growing season of vegetables. The manure is usually put in the field every rainy season or every three days during the rainy season. However, our advice is to use it every three days. Even children can do this. We have conducted field research and developed it based on the determination that it can be used effectively in areas where it may be difficult to apply organic fertilizer every season. The purpose of this practice is to emphasize that netty half-moon pots can be used very conveniently even in small farms.To what depth can the netty pot be buried in the Field?The netty half-moon pot is applied to garden, flower, and vegetable fields. Therefore, it is buried in or on the surface in the ground in a way that we can easily see. However, if the planting is done with small seeds, it is buried in the ground leaving only the handle exposed on the surface."}

{"text": "Question: Do I need antibiotics? \n ### Answer: \u2014a test of the rule \u201cantibiotic and other infection control\u201d will be triggered if any of the following reactions is given: fever (> 38.0 \u00b0C, repeat when shooting up to 38.5 \u00b0C), increased leukocytes > 10 * 109/L), increased C-reactive protein C-reactive protein > 100 mg/L, purulent secretion or tissue, or systemic embolism. At this point, the treatment initiation is judged by the physicians as an infection, to start a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, and to wear air leak care within 2\u20136 h, and the positive culture specimens are beneficial to avoid unnecessary use. When it is overcombination, unnecessary discontinuing, reducing air leak care, and related to other frequently used antibiotics, are useful to prevent infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are not only without benefit, but also may contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant mechanisms [25\u201328]."}
{"text": "Question: What sort of stool softener would you recommend? \n ### Answer: It is well accepted and has been widely proposed that increased intake of dietary fiber could reduce constipation. Its main role is to enhance the trapping of water through a gel-forming process that alters the visco-elastic properties of feces, which in turn stimulates colon motility directly and indirectly through stimulating endogenous secretion of water 17, 28. The rationale for oral treatment with soluble fibers for chronic functional constipation is based on several observations 29. Soluble fiber can perform five functions: enhancing fecal bulking, maximizing the amount of water absorbed, creating an intestinal microbe-active substrate, stimulating bowel motility, and enhancing maintenance of continence 17, 28. A study including daily diet and lifestyle advice (crude fibers 15\u201330g/d) compared to lifestyle and stool softeners, laxatives and enemas 18 over a 2 years period found that personal hygiene products, stool softeners, laxatives and enemas ranged from 87% to 88%, far greater than the numbers found in any study to date 6. Among people with functional constipation who take prunes, the incidence of personal hygiene products, stool softeners, laxatives and enemas decreased 19% over four months 30. Prunes taken as a diet supplement (30.5 \u00b1 7.2 g/week) for four months in people with functional constipation caused a significant 52% reduction in the number of personal hygiene products, a 16% reduction in over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, and no change in prescription laxatives and enemas 22. Consumption of 75.0 \u00b1 6.7 g prune juice would produce significant reduction of over-the-counter (3%) personal hygiene products, (57%) stool softeners, and 13.5% over-the-counter (5%) and prescription (5%) laxatives 13.

Antacids were not readily available in the early part of the twentieth century. Bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol released in 1898, would have been used later. The far more prevalent ulcers were caused by heavy consumption of spicy foods, and smoking. Both of these conditions were mostly reversed by quitting smoking and modifying one's diet to exclude select foods. They were not treated with medications of any kind. Aspirin seemed to exacerbate the pain and lesions. Hence a treatise on aspirin. Bismuth salts, however, came to be used in the late twentieth century as a treatment for non-reticular ulcers."}

You can also consider Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 to be useful in acute infectious diarrhea. Probiotic yogurt or fermented milk is good for lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus casesi DN114001 is effective against childhood respiratory infections. Lactobacillus fermentum B94 is good against childhood atopic dermatitis. There is little evidence about the effects of probiotics on geriatric patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

{"text": "Question: Is Bactrim the best option for a uti? \n ### Answer: The question asks about Diagnostic Antimicrobial Stewardship. But in treating UTIs one should not use diagnostic guidance but should treat. Fluoroquinolones are problematic in treating an infection with Citrobacter. Citrobacter are about as broadly susceptible to aminoglycosides as they are to TMP/SMX 34 When you consider the side effect profile is more favorable and the cheaper the tool that you use at this point in time, suggested fluoroquinolone treatment of a UTI is less than ideal.

{"text": "Question: Would aleve or Tylenol be best for the pain I feel mostly at night? \n ### Answer: This may seem obvious to some, but physiotherapists hear this from patients every day \u2013 is it possible or advisable to differentiate? It is possible when considering drugs to compare analgesic potencies, side effect profiles, efficacy (in the rheumatoid arthritis patient group) and whether the pain is due to acute or chronic inflammatory/neuropathic pain. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that medications can influence gene expression in human cells, which for pain may include infiltrating inflammatory cells. In our patient population, we sometimes suggest that initially a \u2018medium\u2019 potency medication with an acute inflammatory effect may encourage more arthritic reactions in subsequent years. For this reason we may choose, for example, atorvastatin and co-codamol. Aspirin (an anti-inflammatory agent) is assumed to be a safe drug, yet studies have noted early dosing in childhood may be associated with cognitive defects, depression and vascular morbidity.[10\u201313] Aspirin is not recommended for young adults given its long QT syndrome implications. We sometimes discuss with patients that if they feel one NSAID is ineffective they may not wish to continue using it 20 to 30 years later, but should consider a shorter course of stronger drug, and so minimise their total drug exposure. Patients may complain of stomach disruption and the associated acid reflux while on long-term NSAID. It is important to emphasise that these medications do have serious adverse effects that need to be assessed, but which can, with different applications, be minimised."}

{"text": "Question: Is it ok to take probiotics while pregnant? \n ### Answer: It seems logical that the best thing we can do for our baby is to use prenatal probiotics to strengthen the gut and promote delivery of good bacteria. However, to date little research has been done on probiotics in human pregnancy. We should be cautious, as probiotics hold the potential for an immune over-reaction (exactly what we want to avoid during pregnancy). Chronic inflammation has been suggested as a potential risk factor for certain pregnancy complications, particularly in hypertensive-pregnancy . For example, hypertension and pre-eclampsia can result in the placental production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a  (Figure 2). Because certain probiotics are natural stimulants of cytokine production, we have to be careful in choosing a \u201cgood bacteria\u201d to take. Hypertensive-pregnancy is the second leading cause of Maternal and Neonatal mortality in Global North and Global South . In addition, hypertensive-pregnancy is a known risk factor for PID and is associated with antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Hedrich et al., noted that normal pregnancy immunoeffector activities were not altered after probiotic treatment, and supplementation with probiotics throughout pregnancy was deemed safe for both mothers and fetuses. The author also noted that probiotic inclusion in basic nutritional supplements, such as Iron vitamin complex supplementation, could provide optimal treatment for pre-existing anemia (common in pregnancy) and enhance fetal iron accretion."}

These include but are not limited to the onset of symptoms, duration of illness, the ability of the child to open the eye, eyelid swelling or cherry eye, number of episodes with fever, redness of the white of the eyes, sticky mucus/discharge from eyes, other symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, otitis media, or the complexity of the problem, as this will also guide the decision to refer the child.

{"text": "Question: Does it matter if drooling occurs during sleep? \n ### Answer: Yes, it matters to the level of distress the parent experiences, regardless of the volume of drool. It may also influence occurrence of parentally-perceived and other sleep problems, such as sleep disruption, exposure to hypoxia, and parental sleep loss. These findings add information on the role of sleep disorders in drooling and influence on parental distress. It is theoretically possible that LDD reduces the volume of air passing through the nasal cavity, produce negative intrathoracic pressure swings and thus reduce nasal pressure (Kosak et al., 1980), and potentially induce obstructive sleep apnea (Butler et al., 2003). Clearly there is a need to explore the mechanistic interaction between LDD and sleep disordered breathing and expand our knowledge on the major function of LDD and its presumed protective value. This may enable recommendations on how to manage drooling and further contribute to prevent or treat nighttime drooling."}

{"text": "Question: What can I do to prevent the yeast infection? \n ### Answer: Here are some suggestions to decrease and treat yeast infections:1. Wear breathable cotton underwear and fit them loosely to the body. More air circulation around your genitals may help to keep the penile skin dry and less prone to yeast overgrowth.2. After masturbating or sex, ensure your genitalia are clean and dry. Avoid wearing condoms if possible during masturbation as they can trap moisture so that it remains around your genitals.3. Keeps your genitals dry and try to avoid wet foreskin. Try to dry your foreskin skin after cleaning your penis. Moisturizing with lotion is vital as it maintains the penile skin's health, but try to choose a water-based rather than oil-based moisturizer.4. Wear baggy, loose-fitting, and cotton-made shorts or underwear. You can use a barrier cream if you are planning to wear tight-fitting pants for a prolonged period.5. Wash your genitals regularly using soap and water but try to avoid harsh detergents (ask for mild soap-free/alcohol-free). Rinse well and pat the area dry instead of rubbing it vigorously.6. Use sufficient amount of water and soap for bathing. Avoid using bubble baths as they can cause irritation. Be gentle while drying the genital skin.7. If you have recurrent yeast infections, get an antifungal cream to keep at home to apply yourself or have a partner apply it to you once per week. Moreover, to prevent infection recurrence, avoid wearing tight-fitting pants and non-breathable fabrics.8. You can eat unsweetened yogurt with active cultures of Lactobacillus or Lactobacillus acidophilus live bacteria as they might be beneficial and reduce the number of yeast infections (8).When to contact a doctorGenerally, it is a serious infection if:\uf077Your symptoms do not improve after one week of OTC treatment.\uf077Your symptoms worsen after treatment.\uf077You experience more than one yeast infection per month.Or if you are immunocompromised (e.g., HIV positive) or diabetic and have any symptoms of yeast infection.Materials and methodsDigital media examinationsGP photo notes including"}

Fever needs to reach 103\u00b0F or more for the fever to be considered a \u201cvery high fever\u201d that can be associated with serious illness.(2)Which of the following is considered to be a serious illness?The following are considered to be serious and life-threatening diseases: pneumonia, meningitis, tuberculosis, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis. In addition, certain viral diseases such as measles, Rubella, mumps, varicella, viral hepatitis, and hepatitis A and B are considered serious illnesses.(2)4.What is the route of transmission of this disease?Most of the diseases above are transmitted via droplet particles released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This particularly does not apply only to the viral infectious diseases mentioned above but also to most of the bacterial diseases mentioned above. Importantly, tuberculosis transmission occurs only when a person is exposed to the cough or sneezes while tubercle bacilli were in the patient's mouth cavity or airways. Tuberculosis can also transmit through airborne route.(2)5.Which disease may require the identification of the organism?The accurate diagnosis of some diseases (infectious and non-infectious) requires the identification or isolation of the microorganism, because only finding the microorganism can confirm the disease.(2)6.Which is an invasive disease?An invasive disease presents when a pathogen normally localized to the skin or mucous membranes usually will spread and spread into the bloodstream and tissue sites. Such diseases are connected with high morbidity and mortality rates. These diseases are: \u226aBartonella quintana\u226b\u2013 a bacterium that transmitted via body fluids and is responsible for trench fever or Trench Fever; HIV (Human Immunodeficiency virus)\u2013a virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome); \u226aHepatitis A virus\u226b and \u226aHepatitis B virus\u226b\u2013 transmitted via blood and body fluids and cause chronic infections of the liver.

{"text": "Question: Do you recommend a vitamin for urinary tract health after taking antibiotics? \n ### Answer: Lanreotide is usually not recommended. Calcium and vitamin D is sometimes advised. It is used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin E plays an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, so a high concentration of alpha-tocopherol in the bone marrow can accelerate the processes of osteoporosis. Here, vits is included. Quercetin or CVD is often recommended since it seems to both maintain the collagen and elastin structure that sustains the anatomical integrity of the urogenital and digestive mucosa, and contribute to tissue repair by scavenging of free radicals and reduction of inflammation. And methionine seemed beneficial especially in peripheral neuropathy. However, l-\u03b1-Lipoic acid is not listed for a reason there. Also, it is important to contain vitamin D and K. In that sense, you should mention about the olanzapine-induced bradycardia, who was in vitamin D and K deficiency. And mecobalamin seems to be beneficial in intestinal fibrosis with tetracyclines.

{"text": "Question: I would like to ask, how does Flonase help with ear fluid? \n ### Answer: Will it drain fluid out if there is too much already? Since it may mix up with the infection, I suspect it will make the ears worse. I hope you can clarify this for me. Thank you. Flonase (fluticasone propionate) is a topical steroid frequently used to relieve allergy and other nasal symptoms. It works by reducing inflammation and congestion in the nose. I am not aware of any evidence that it affects ear fluid. It\u2019s possible that the ear and nose are somehow related (like perhaps the linings of the structures secrete mucous with a similar composition). I suspect it would be not harmful to try it on your ears, but I am not convinced it would be helpful. These are my opinions, notbased on any evidence, so please consult a doctor before you use it on your ears. Surgical interventions often arise when conservative management has failed, with bilateral disease or with complications. [2, 3]. Tympanostomy tube insertion is often the first surgical option and is used to maintain a perforation and allow pressure equalization between the mastoid cavity and the external environment. The use of ventilation tubes allows for ventilation of the middle ear, resolution of otosclerosis, or atrophy of the mucosa and promotes re-epithelialization.\u00b0 Thus, performing tympanostomy tube placements requires a minimal quantum of experience. This study aims to evaluate the use of the HEARO atlas to facilitate tympanostomy tube insertion for otosclerosis."}

What I was saying is my neurologist gave me a prescription for the sero, and he allows the otc pharmacies to fill it. I can see how that would make me annoyed too the doc did switch me over to that med. I look at SSRI as mines a safety net if I get any actual symptoms real bad, or having a hard time with the meds I already have. I find that you really have to mix and match sometimes with different medications. It seems you can have a lot of GI side effects with one, or a lot of brain/sleep issues. So having each other one can help offset the problems you have with the other. That\u2019s just my opinion of course."}

I am sure that a very convincing answer to this question cannot be given. Perhaps we need the help of some experts involved in sports medicine and orthopedic surgery, but if we turn to these specialists, they may be quite reluctant to answer such a question because of the unknown effects of achieving an optimal figure on the patient's health after the treatment of a fracture. The best way to convince the patient might be to demonstrate that the treatment will reduce suffering from the injury and that the negative effects on health of the side effects of the medical treatment would not outweigh the positive effects of achieving a healthy figure."}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything I can take or use to relieve the itchiness? \n ### Answer: The current clinical management of pruritus usually relies on the systemic administration of benzodiazepines or histamine H1-antagonists (Gonzalo-De-Lomasera et al., 2013). Although well known for their antipruritic effect, these medications are better recognized for their sedative, muscle relaxant and anxiolytic effects. As a consequence, their use is associated to certain adverse events, mainly their sedative and cognitive effects. Moreover, due to these side effects, patients are frequently under dosed to minimized these adverse effects, compromising the effectiveness of the treatments (Gonzalo-De-Lomasera et al., 2013)."}

Used Celebrex in the past but felt that it was not strong enough- Asked by Patient 4 -GINA TreatmentIn humans, exogenous administration of IFN-\u03b11 is used in the treatment of certain Eastern cancer, or to boost the immune response in the case of hepatitis C . In MS, administration of IFN-\u03b2 is designed to block autoimmune disease progression by limiting T-cell proliferation, simultaneously dampening Th-1 and enhancing Treg 5 response. It specifically modulates peripheral T cells, adding to the pool of circulatory Tregs supported by their antigen-independent survival . INF-\u03b2 hampers T-cell dependent cytokine storms by regulating the demarcation of T-cell activity by modulating inflammatory cytokine synthesis, indirectly empowering smoldering Tregs to transcend Th-1 responses. According to Coppi\u2019s study, IFN-\u03b2 diminishes Th1-to-T-reg redistribution and enhances T-reg-associated function . Further, development of IFN-inducible CXCR3 negative Tregs\u2019 pool was shown in a study by Nishimura . Although various factors are involved in Treg development, CXCR3 appears to be an interesting molecule to analyze Treg migration to sites of chronic inflammation. According to more than one experiment, IFN-\u03b2 regulates the trafficking of Tregs through the up-regulation of CXCR3 Other work has been done to marshal the efficacy of an alternate molecule, which is critical for the establishment of peripheral antigen-specific tolerance . The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, specifically correlation protein (nrfp3) was shown to reduce autoimmune arthritis .

{"text": "Question: Is augmentin the same as amoxicillin? \n ### Answer: Amoxicillin is a penicillin synthetase that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is most effective against Gram-negative bacteria and has excellent coverage of common respiratory and genitourinary tract pathogens. Augmentin is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor that potentiates the enzyme inhibition of amoxicillin. Given the mechanism of action, the question could be raised: Is augmentin the same as amoxicillin? The answer is: no. In addition, clavulanic acid has often been used in combination with other antibiotics for its ability to inhibit enzymes such as beta-lactamases, aminopeptidases, phosphinases, and other lysine proteases found in many resistant bacteria.9 Therefore, antibiotics that have been combined with clavulanic acid do not have the same properties as amoxillin."}

The bacteria only play a role in triggering the inflammatory pathway in a susceptible host. The reasoning that it shows up in mixed infections with Aspergillus is mostly due to (a) the procedure of how they collect the clinical samples to test for infection in the setting of HIV and (b) that aspergillus is a common coexisting infection in HIV and both the saliva and blood stream contain fragments of the bacteria upon infection."}

{"text": "Question: Is brochitis infective to others? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes. The disease is caused by a bacterium called Bordetella pertussis. It is highly contagious and spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. The incubation period is 7 to 10 days. The disease is more common in children and can be serious in infants. The symptoms include a cough that lasts for 2 to 8 weeks, whooping, and sometimes vomiting. The cough can be very severe and may interfere with breathing. The disease can also cause irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding in infants. Antibiotics can help shorten the duration of the illness and reduce the risk of complications. Vaccination is the best prevention."}

{"text": "Question: What is the benzonatate? \n ### Answer: Benzonatate is a centrally acting natural respiratory stimulant. The drug binds to \u03bc-opioid receptors located in brain areas that regulate respiration in an agonistic manner. The drug was developed as a substitute for codeine, which has similar respiratory stimulatory but more potent analgesic effects than benzonatate. Combined with citric acid and sodium benzoate, benzonatate is used to relieve cough in cough syrup."}
{"text": "Question: Is it better to try not to cough or to cough? \n ### Answer: Control over coughing would surely be beneficial, since cough is not harmful to the patient except when it persists as a chronic event. An attenuation of the cough reflex would reduce effects on work and others, and there may be interventions that could be helpful to achieve this. But it remains unclear if attenuating the cough reflex would have harmful consequences, particularly in smokers and those with reduced lung function. The benefits of altered cough reflex would thus need to balance a risk of difficulty clearing mucus, thereby setting up a vicious cycle of respiratory illness. It will be important to determine the extent to which cough, induced by smoke exposures, encompasses the responses of cough rather than impulse responding to mechanostimulation. Thus, better understanding of regional lung inflammatory responses following smoking will help provide a basis for developing approaches to interventions and better treatments for cough, such as drugs, biofeedback, and/or deep breathing manoeuvres such as lung-stretch to reduce the reflex sensitivity to cough. After establishing that cough induced by smoke is of intermic lock origin, the reflex can be interfered with by vagal nerve stimulation  or interrupting bronchopulmonary C-fiber afferent traffic. The attraction of stimulating vagal fibers to suppress cough is that there is a dearth of vagal bronchopulmonary afferent input during rapid breathing at rest, so the concern about interrupting breathing disappears . Thus, the afferent vagal bronchopulmonary inputs during rapid breathing at rest can then be targeted ."}

SLIT is immunotherapy (characterized by decreased total IgE and increased IgG).

If you do not have allergies, SLIT would be using an unnecessary, costly procedure without any benefit."}

{"text": "Question: Just wanted to question if you think 3 days would be enough to treat a UTI or why I would have been prescribed more days in the past? \n ### Answer: The 3-day limit of treatment seems a bit short, because 3 days is about the time when most bladder bacteria are even able to begin to replicate and I think that the treatment needs to introduce more than the theoretical amount of IJEF when dealing with UTIs, since the biofilm is essential for pathogenicity of the disease.

Three T2s and 6 T1s seem like a rather few number of data points to base this decision on, I am on the side of the reviewers here. There was no trend towards benefit with the SSRI either so this is not just a case of SSRI not working fast enough. Another red flag is the lack of a placebo group. This should be there, particularly given the \"drug's\" immediate and rapid onset which I find suspicious of being a non-drug effect (Placebo's lag in onset, usually about 2 weeks, has been shown in multiple clinical trials). With every pill that is taken before a shock aversive, the probability of serving as placebo is reduced and not reaching a main shock every time in this study may then itself have served as a predictor too."}

No, currently there are no pharmacological treatments proven to improve itching in AD and even short doses of corticosteroids are not indicated as it may worsen the pruritus. EFA help to alleviate global disease activity including chronic eczema, pruritus and sleep disturbances, but this should not imply a specific effect on pruritus, since when EFA are beneficial on different parameters, global disease activity will also be improved/reduced. The same concept applies to low dose tricyclic antidepressants. Comment 2:84. What if the patient does not tolerate EFA? Comment 3:92. Therefore, could the authors suggest a panel of patients to identify those who might benefit from EFA or other approved or even off-label treatments based on the different sub-phenotypes, severity or chronicity?

{"text": "Question: How fast does paxlovid work? \n ### Answer: At the time of this writing, the literature produced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is dominated by studies of courses of therapy, which requires 5 days of treatment, for which 2 to 5 days of follow-up have been provided. In this interim summary of 108,649 patients in 18 publications, paxlovid reduction of viral load hemorrhagic strokes rate occurred with impressive rapidity, particularly within 48 to 72 hours. At the second day of treatment, a decline of \u223c4 logs could be seen (3). Although these were published data on early treatment of COVID-19 before marketing authorization was approved, there is no clear signal that early treatment of acute stroke by IV thrombolysis is qualitatively different from chronic stroke where treatment with paxlovid is currently approved. Acute and chronic stroke should not be treated as separate disease entities, because acute stroke is often a sequela of chronic stroke in patients with cardioembolic embolic risk factors. Finally, no information is provided on how fast the underlying chronic stroke will improve. As paxlovid treatment is not a cure but a prolonged process, it makes sense to treat patients until clinical improvement, neurological symptoms improvement or death. The neurological improvement process should continue in journal publications, in association with direct evidence of underlying viral load reduction. In this case, paxlovid appeared to be effective within 72 hours of death, but it remains unknown whether neurological symptoms improve such as in other conditions (stroke, heart attack). If the other approved indications for paxlovid vary little from the original half-life and dosages, even in cases of stroke, half the original dosages are also expected to be effective, if government regulators approve lower costs to expand low- and middle-income countries, without undue delay, an improved profile."}

{"text": "Question: How does BV occur in a patient? \n ### Answer: BV is a polymicrobial infection, and the most common bacteria involved are Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera type I, and Prevotella bivia. The pathogenesis of BV is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including changes in the vaginal microbiome, host immune response, and hormonal changes. The most common theory is that an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome, with a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in anaerobic bacteria, leads to an overgrowth of these bacteria and the production of amines and other metabolites that are toxic to the host. This can lead to inflammation and irritation of the vaginal mucosa, which can cause symptoms such as itching, burning, and discharge."}

{"text": "Question: Are there any alternatives to the Wellbutrin? \n ### Answer: Most cases of VTE are associated with reversible risk factors, so these should be brought under control whenever possible and changes in therapy initiated where possible. For patients with an unprovoked VTE, some studies suggest that aspirin 325 mg /d may reduce the recurrence rate and long term prophylaxis with anticoagulants may be appropriate for women with hormone-related risk factors including estrogen, oral contraceptives and progesterone-one only pills . However, no proof of long-term or short-term mortality benefit exists for patients treated with aspirin and its use is only recommended for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction. Recurrent risk for VTE remains high in some selected patients, for example patients with idiopathic pulmonary embolism who appear to share common risk factors with the tamoxifen women (eg older women, obese, postmenopausal). There may well be an underlying inherent risk of clotting with tamoxifen that will put these patients at higher risk of future thromboembolism. We continue to support the recommendations of Carroll et al (2008) : Tamoxifen Continuation Plus Aspirin (TAP) (tamoxifen plus aspirin daily) is now our preferred strategy as it will result in lower health care costs as compared with tamoxifen alone. However, if a patient is at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend that tamoxifen be stopped and replaced by some other type of estrogen."}
{"text": "Question: Is there a way to prevent these vertigo attacks? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes. The most important preventive measure is to avoid the triggers. The most common triggers are head movements, especially rotation, and changes in head position. Therefore, it is important to avoid quick head movements and to keep the head in a stable position. This can be done by using a neck brace or a neck collar. Another important preventive measure is to avoid activities that cause vertigo attacks, such as climbing stairs, walking on uneven surfaces, and driving. It is also important to avoid activities that cause fatigue, such as prolonged standing, walking, and lifting heavy objects."}

Subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually caused by a blow to the eye or a hard eye-rubbing, but it can also occur spontaneously. The pain and sensitivity to light usually last for a few days, but the hemorrhage itself can take a couple of weeks to clear up."}

{"text": "Question: Is Claritin or Zyrtec safe with breastfeeding? \n ### Answer: Both Zyrtec and Claritin are considered safe for use during breastfeeding. However, Claritin is more likely to cause side effects in breastfed infants than Zyrtec. Claritin is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, and it is metabolized to desmethylclaritin in the infant\u2019s body. Desmethylclaritin is the active metabolite of Claritin, and it has a longer half-life than Claritin. This means that infants are more likely to experience side effects from Claritin than from Zyrtec."}
{"text": "Question: Ok, would ice or heat help as well? \n ### Answer: Since a big issue seems to be inflammation. In that case I would goes towards heat application (and massage/lymph flow help unrefractory areas), if the lymphedema is more of a chronic condition with fibrosed tissues and partial lymphatic block (I dont know the specifics of the case). If the lymphedema is more acute and caused by a disturbance in lymphatic flow more recently, I would go for the more anti-inflammatory type of treatment. I would then do compressive bandaging only in the case of acute or recent lymphatic obstruction, as I find that excessive pressure and/or compression on a chronic condition will just lead to more fibrosis in the skin. You may have over 60% of lymphatic drainage from tissues being though afferent lymphatics (I think this percentage may be even higher, not sure though, a few recent studies have confirmed the role of this type of lymphatic vessels as drainage pathways in tems of a rapid drainage in upper and lower tissues at least!'ll refer to this another time.), so loss of these pathway/function through excessive pressure and fibrosis, will give a loss of function, as the lymph still has to go somewhere, so it just goes into venous circulation if it cant go through the afferent lymphatics."}

{"text": "Question: Could a sinus infection cause loss of taste and smell? \n ### Answer: Although taste and smell losses are widely recognized as common symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, in a recent British project, only about half of respondents (48%) would expect loss of smell and taste to occur during a sinus infection. As pointed out above, some clinicians consider smell loss to be a key clinical feature of sinusitis. However, patients' perceptions regarding the relationship between sinus infections and taste- and smell-loss do not appear to be as strong."}

{"text": "Question: Is it possible for it to be pneumonia? \n ### Answer: Lung ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and the differentiation of lobar and interstitial pneumonia. In addition, because it is radiation free, the amount of usage in children has increased . Determination of pneumonia with dilatation of the bronchi on ultrasonography is accepted as positive, but dilatation of the bronchus is a severely generalized finding that occurs in various diseases as well as in asthma, COPD, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and community-acquired pneumonia. Accordingly, the patient cannot be evaluated on the basis of this specific finding alone. In addition, detection of changes indicating pulmonary edema may occur in both acute bronchiolitis and asthma . However, the operating principle of ultrasound wand in these diseases is different, with a target better seen in acute bronchiolitis than in asthma and there being no pathology seen on CT of the chest. Additionally, the frequency of deterioration is seen in acute bronchiolitis. For this reason, although dilatation purulent bronchi are detected on ultrasound in asthma and acute bronchiolitis, differentiation should be given particular importance by the physician."}

{"text": "Question: Is it ok to have antibotics and cough medicine at the same time? \n ### Answer: No, it is not recommended to take antibiotics and cough medicine at the same time. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral infections such as the common cold. Taking antibiotics when you have a viral infection, such as the common cold, will not help you get better and may cause antibiotic resistance."}

{"text": "Question: Is it normal to have slight intermittent blurring with a bacterial pink eye? \n ### Answer: It's been about 24 hours since BC+ to BC- and 2 weeks since the last dose of Erythromycin and the blurring is present. It can be difficult to see through my eye but only during certain times of the day. If the doctors and pharmacists on here haven't had this experience themselves, I strongly recommend that they seek the advice of an ophthalmologist. Visual clarity when suffering from an eye infection leaves a lot to be desired. It's a frustrating and rather disconcerting experience, and it can hinder quick and precise movement of the eye, thus slowing down simple functions such as picking up an object or drinking from a cup while walking. It's markedly diminishing with the Erythromycin drops but was still moderately present."}
{"text": "Question: What are the long term deficits that may happen? \n ### Answer: The question suggests that apraxia is always permanent. I am not aware of this standard view on apraxia (see below) but there are temporary symptoms in apraxia of object use \u2013 e.g. in the right IPS so called virtual lesion syndrome (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-9109(13)60154-7). In apraxia of gesture(use) the deficits are more often more permanent (Stanfield and Evans, 2009). I agree that, if one treats the amnestic and apraxic deficits separately only the first one could be completely recovered. For some aphasic patients with apraxia of object use the deficit will be permanent, for other it might be partly reviewed with training (I am not saying that this will be the case in most patients, but it is not true that the lesion always results in permanent apraxia). Therefore I object to the following sentence in the last paragraph: we can term apraxia as permanent. This point needs to be addressed properly."}

{"text": "Question: Is there an antibiotic that could help ? \n ### Answer: A few years ago it seemed that antibiotics killed off some of the leptoplasts and inflammation even though they did not clear the infection. There does not seem to be a class of drugs that is uniformly superior. If your illness is helminth driven the two most powerful antibiotics are the floxquinones or the tetracyclines (doxycycline). The floxquinones cover the Coxiella bacterium and a number of the anaerobes that contribute to Lyme and Titan-3  and to a lesser extent the melioidasis of tularetum and a few enterobacteria."}
{"text": "Question: Should I put the drops in both eyes to prevent it from spreading to my other eye? \n ### Answer: Many eyedrops that are used for anterior segment disease, including antibiotics such as chloramphenicol or tobramycin, are used in both eyes during the infectious episode in eyes with unilateral disease. However, this practice may be unnecessary for some antibiotics and may explain why significant numbers of patients develop macular oedema in the fellow eye [74, 75]. There seems some evidence that in general, if one eye has active infection, these of use drops may have some transient effect in the fellow eye. The antibiotics used, the formulation, the route of application, the duration of the infection and the possible concurrent disease may determine whether drops should be used in both eyes [42, 74, 75]. This should be thought about when considering potential treatments for CMV retinal infection, particularly steroids, which are more likely to work in one eye than both eyes, and antivirals (ganciclovir) which are presumably more likely to work in both eyes."}

{"text": "Question: Would high heart rate be caused by being overweight at all? \n ### Answer: A high BMI along such a system, with high HRV to all self-reported weight scales in Table 1, seems to suggest that being overweight causes poor health generally. And especially poor cardiovascular health: indeed, as predicted by Bloch\u2019s findings, we observe a steady negative correlation of BMI on the HRV descriptor of IQR. Weight seems to facilitate worst outcomes, and by this hypothesis, the more a body weights against the normal ideal of a healthy BMI, the worse are its general health consequences. Hence the similarities between using BMI as a 0-point measure of obesity and using zero as a measure of no diabetes does indeed seem well-founded. But this is more than a metaphor: it suggests (via equation 5 and the appendix) that obese bodies may need higher blood pressure to meet bodily needs, but so at the expense of higher mortality rates."}

{"text": "Question: What's the STD test? \n ### Answer: Large sample size can increase the statistical power of the test and then the negative result be replaced by the positive one. Moreover, there are some problems in this study which attributable to the experiment design. First of all, the plasma from the same condition should be hybridized for replicate, and then its non-biological variation can be subtracted through a series of biological tests. Besides, quality control of microarray experiments including chip plotting, data normalization, and publication of the raw data is necessary for the research. In fact, lots of microarray meta-analysis are designed based on multiple studies conducted by heterogeneous platform. Some algorithms especially CEL method were developed for correcting different platforms to ensure the reliability of transcriptomic analysis. Zhu, G  presented an effective CEL method for meta-analysis of gene expression data. Wada, Y. A  devised statistical pipelines using weighted diversity pooling with index and c links in a cahoots workflow which can remove systematic variation and yield effective detection. Last but not the least, we emphasized that the same staining protocols and/or profiling platforms (e.g., the same chip type, or same scanner machine) are suggested to be used when multiple cohorts are generated."}

Again no hostility just don\u2019t understand because my boyfriend gets OREO probiotic cookies and feeding our son those would be eating them daily if they are additive whereas the supplement is only like a couple times/week. It almost seems scammy like you have to keep buying, it needs to be powered to be effective.

{"text": "Question: Ok at what point should I be concerned that it goes beyond viral and develops into infection? \n ### Answer: A: That's a really good question. I think that's an evolving question that people don't yet have the answer to. The problem with people with cancer, if they get infected, it can go badly. And so as quickly as we can tell you how to tell patients when to seek care, we should do that. So, I can tell you that in mild cases, where a patient might have a cough or runny nose, that would not be a reason to start antibiotics, especially if it's been within a week of getting sick. That would, again, be a reason to maybe go to the gym but certainly not to see a doctor. But if that persists and also maybe associated with fever or some gastrointestinal symptoms where, then it's appropriate to go to the doctor and get a good workup. The guidelines generally say three days of symptoms or purulent sputum or having a temperature over 38.3 [centigrade]. For a not mild case, with shortness of breath or two weeks of symptoms or a patient that's getting worse, that patient needs to be seen in the ER."}

The challenge in making correct diagnosis of cough is thinking through the possible causes. Such causes include bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastro-esophageal reflux and / or chronic fever syndromes, among others. On the other hand to curb excessive It has been shown that poor communication between asthma patients and healthcare provider has a significant a role to play in poor asthma control \u2019.

{"text": "Question: and what time of day is best for taking Lexapro? \n ### Answer: These things should be included in the initial information provided about a medication. I spoke with one pharmacist who recommended a reduced starting dose of 3 milligrams per day and one pharmacist who suggested a maintained lower starting dose middle method, but neither gave reasons for this, they merely offered these suggestions. But specifically, for some patients, 5 milligrams might be too much, too fast, and starting at lower than the most common starting dose may cause fewer side effect issues than jumping right into the most common starting dose. Like I said, this is just one example, but this entire post is about a lack of standardized initial information about medications for patients. I think it would be really easy to have a national database of the most commonly recommended initial dose and other suggestions for specific medications. Often, the call to include such information in initial visit plans or in handouts is indirect: there is research that has shown effects on adherence or demonstrating how including this information at the first visit could serve to reassure initial visitors. But what I\u2019m arguing here is that there is value in including such information, namely patient-centered, anecdotal evidence at the visiting patient\u2019s level. Furthermore, many medications and medical treatments come with a long list of stigmatizing or even unintended side effects. I think patients deserve to know about what physicians have learned about side effect reduction and patient anecdotes about such adjustments. Whether or not stigma is reduced in this way is central to patient\u2019s post-therapy experiences, health outcomes, and adherence to treatment."}

{"text": "Question: What would be the approach if it's a resistant infection? \n ### Answer: Which strategy do you prefer and why?Antimicrobial resistance is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge in the management of infectious diseases. Further studies, dynamically and precisely summarizing the nature of antimicrobial susceptibility, and its associated changing epidemiology, should always be in the spotlight. On the other hand, case reports may be the source that alerts clinicians on unusual and poorly recognized symptoms, and any detailed description about the place of presentation, clinical manifestations, laboratory test procedure, microbiological and histopathological processes, and its management, together with coherent discussion, can guide further studies and clarify previously unrecognized co-associations (Atl\u0131, Cetin, & Ba\u015ftu\u011f, 2020).Antibiotic sensitivity testing is important for the prevention of the emergence of resistant bacteria. Determination of the type of pathogenic and the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics prior to antibiotic therapy is one of the most important measures in the fight against microbial resistance. When considering case reports or case series reports, a follow-up that summarizes what strategies have been developed in resistant infections and which one is successful can be more informative.https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/114755/Research-Highlight-Antimicrobial-resistance-Almanac_tc.pdf?cgid=Research-Highlight-Antimicrobial-resistance-Almanac_tcfor programs that provide parenteral antibiotic therapy without delay in children with life-threatening infectious diseases:Remarks: In case of proven benefits in India that large group of children is provided parenteral antibiotic therapy without a delay, Editorial of Indian Pediatrics and Journal of Pediatric and Neonatal Care in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India alone (C.

As you start to release your tensions, tightness, and general muscle holding, you find yourself becoming less anxious. Past experiences are easier to be put in perspective. Concerns for health of individual group members arise, and they share these openly as trust establishes in the group and the setting. This has also been reported in previous studies . Even in the small experimental group in this study, where the experimental condition was new to everyone in the group, with no one fully knowing the purpose of the intervention, and with even less prior experience with the methods of relaxation, the participants did in fact sustain their initiative to learn the method, and at the end of the study participants reported a dislike for ending the intervention.

{"text": "Question: Any suggestions on how to relieve the chest pain when coughing? \n ### Answer: Dr. Xiao's prescription for the Miracle of Medicine: First, the member of health care team asks the patient about the location and how severe the pain is. If the patient can point out where the pain is at all, it is because it is not very serious, according to the theory of Chinese medicine. If the pain is so painful that he/she can't draw a circle, it is because he/she is likely to have vicious collapse and difficulty in cough.Then, the health care team asks them to cough with a deep breath and cough must be loud and irritating. This way can clear the phlegms and the pain can be relieved.For severe cough pain, the health team suggests to give some of the medicines as follows: feng-san-he-ye, Ma Bu Si syndromes formula mainly contains fragrant grass rhizome (Atractylodes), elm bark (Celtis kidney), and Poria cocos, which is used to clear \u201cphlegm\u201d and strengthen the lung for them to be able to cough up the phlegm.Huo Che Qi Tao for shu-san-he is made of Ma bu Cao with a bitter taste, which is bitter, cold, and toxic, and excels in dispersing phlegm and promoting urination, such as Ge Gen, TangProtocol and Drainage Qi plus Chentzishen granules.According to Dr. Xiao's troubleshooting list, she suggests taking prevention astringent for dryness in the lungs to promote qi and motility of the lung. Patients are asked to use Fangfeng Muxiang Shenbao Tang to disperse the phlegm of lung heat and heart to dissipate irritability. For patients who cough a lot with cold chills, Beware of Cold with External Relution and Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercise, as recommended by Dr. Xiao, is recommended, which improves the pathogenic environment of the yang. Ping Bu Tang is used to stop itching and cough curing cough and asthma by Dr. Xiao. The Qi is coagulated and a granule of Ban Xia Ku Shen Tang is used as the ingredient."}

It is a common condition that is often associated with poor oral hygiene, smoking, and certain medical conditions. The white tongue is usually not serious, but it can sometimes be a sign of a more serious problem. The white coating on the tongue is caused by bacteria and dead cells that accumulate on the surface of the tongue. The tongue is a mucous membrane, and like all mucous membranes, it has a layer of mucus on the surface. This mucus helps to protect the tongue from irritants and keeps it moist. When the tongue is healthy, the mucus layer is thin and transparent. However, when the tongue is unhealthy, the mucus layer can become thick and milky. This can cause the tongue to appear white or coated."}

{"text": "Question: Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ? \n ### Answer: Over the last two decades, randomised controlled trials have shown a beneficial effect of omega-3 supplementation (fish oil) on visual function , , . Several factors suggest that lutein and zeaxanthin might have a similar effect. First, visual function is dependent on good illumination . Given that good sunlight illumination has been shown to be protective against AMD development in the NHS/AREDS studies  and against the progression of the late stages of AMD , Vitamin D supplementation, would be worth evaluating for its effect on visual function. Lutein and zeaxanthin being the main carotenoids in the human lens, it is reasonable to suggest they may contribute to the lenses light filtering effect. Furthermore, like other carotenoids (e.g lycopene, beta-carotene) which have been found to jointly accumulate with zeaxanthin  in the lens, lutein may also exert a protective effect on the lens. Lastly, lutein found to maintain the dark adaptation shape in the presence of high light exposure whereas zeaxanthin doesn't , may have the ability to improve night (and light induced) vision similar to omega-3 nutrients ."}

{"text": "Question: Are there more than one type of nausea medication? \n ### Answer: Yes-- Ki-Hun and Chol-Su (2016) Nausea and vomiting are generally responses to a variety of factors including motion, emotions, and toxic substances. From this point of view, we can group nausea and vomiting into two categories. Nausea and vomiting resulting from physiological factors, and vomiting and nausea induced by psychological factors.In previous studies, drug-related nausea and vomiting were more commonly used instead of general nausea and vomiting. The five stages of Cardarelli\u2019s theory, which is thematic for drug-induced nausea and vomiting, will well fit in Ki-Hun\u2019s theory.

{"text": "Question: But is testicular pain not a symptom of chlamydia? \n ### Answer: In many ways this is a fair question. While testicular pain can often be a symptom of other STIs, the main symptom of urethral chlamydia is pain in micturition or haematuria (7). The symptoms of rectal chlamydia include rectal discharge, soreness or bleeding (7). With regard to testicular pain, chlamydia infection may still be a cause; under the assumption of asymptomatic urethral or rectal infection. Furthermore, testicular pain can precede urethral infection, therefore not excluding chlamydia (26)."}

{"text": "Question: Can I take Zyrtec and benedryl at the same time? \n ### Answer: Yes, Zyrtec (cetirizine) and benedryl (diphenhydramine) are both antihistamines that work on histamine receptors. However, they belong to different classes of antihistamine. Zyrtec is an H1-antihistamine, while benedryl is a piperazine, or H1-antihistamine that has sedating properties. Consequently, they have different side effect profiles. Benedryl can cause sedation, dizziness, anxiety, confusion, dryness of the mouth, and difficulty urinating. Zyrtec can cause sedation, headache, dryness of the mouth, coughing, and wheezing. Flute and budesonide as liquid drops can also be combined to treat rhinitis.

{"text": "Question: Can i take the painkiller and the antibiotics at the same time or wait hours in between ? \n ### Answer: 2Pain killing is related to inflammation whereas antibiotics are related to viral infections. So it is only an issue of safely using the drugs together. The answer will be related to side effects of drugs, e.g. nausea. Therefore, you will need to ask patients about the possible side effects and which drug works better if some specific side effects happen. This will lead you to further ask about their medical history and lab test results, e.g. kidney and liver functions. They will also let you know if they are taking other medications, e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs, which can be mentioned in the patient medication history.E.g. If patient has had nausea as side effect many times due to the painkiller, it is obvious you need to prescribe with a different brand. If they complain about they had nausea but it was reduced with (brand) painkiller, you may want to switch to a longer term painkiller, e.g. acetaminophen. If side effects caused by antibiotics are specific, you should massage the patient first with an anti-emetic drug, then suggest him to take antibiotics after several hours. E.g. use serotonin 3 antagonist before dosing his antibiotic."}

Kang evaluated the effects of allopurinol on testicular tissues in rats. Rolaox, 300 mg/kg body wt/day orally for 7 days had no effect on the testosterone level, spermatogenesis, or the sperm count (39). In dogs, oral doses during pregnancy did not cause congenital defects. In rodents, allopurinol has not shown embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. Allopurinol has not shown mutagenic effects in vitro. Long-term use of allopurinol without adequate protection had been shown to cause cutaneous lesions and fever in some patients in the form of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.

{"text": "Question: Does hydroxyzine have any affect on metabolism or weight gain? \n ### Answer: Patients of all ages can be cared for in a wide variety of environments, from home visits to ICUs. If hydroxyzine is used when SBSE is first diagnosed, one might speculate that the child would achieve and maintain ideal weight from the beginning if intubation (or associated complications) could be avoided. For that matter, if a pediatric patient had multiple episodes of SBSE, conventionally managed usually by intubation, and is then switched to an anti-seizure management paradigm employing adjunctive hydroxyzine for several years, one would suspect that the hydroxyzine treated patient would not gain inappropriate weight as s/he aged. Studies would, of course, be helpful in forming guidelines regarding the question of weight gain."}
{"text": "Question: Does low thyroid contribute to weight gain? \n ### Answer: Based on most of the known experimental studies there is evidence that low levels of T3 might play an important role influencing a patient\u2019s BMI. The sub-physiological levels of thyroid hormones lead to reduction in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and oxidation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, eventually resulting in weight gain.(an influence of T3 levels on basal metabolic rate is described in HEAD diagnositcs 2007) . However, although low levels of thyroid and impaired thermogenesis are often blamed for weight gain, there are some doubts about possible causal relationship between T3 resistance and increased adiposity. So, some authors  argue that clinical features and weight gain in patients with T3 resistance cannot be fully explained by the occurrence of central thyroid resistance. Whereas others  suggest that obesity and insulin resistance can lead to reduced central thermal sensitivity, low T3 levels, increased lipoprotein lipase activity, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors number, which, altogether, could cause weight gain."}

Increased pressure should cause your fingers to feel a noticeable pulsation on the opposite side of your neck. To relieve tension while doing the test, breathe deeply, relax, and sit for a few minutes. Elbow and forearm should be clear of the arm on which the pulse is taken and the forearm should be horizontal. Place your head and back on the backrest of the chair. Put your bare feet flat on the floor. Take your blood pressure one time. Put on a blood pressure cuff that\u2019s correctly sized, and fasten it around your arm, about 1/2 inch above your wrist.

{"text": "Question: What is the best hypertension treatment for patients who are also diabetic? \n ### Answer: RAAS blockers are a safe treatment for diabetic nephropathy. The most effective way to stop diabetic kidney disease progression is to use agents that block the RAAS. Conventional drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics are among the most widely utilised. Other classes of drugs are therefore adequate for reducing blood pressure and slowing kidney disease development. ACEIs, ARBs, and diuretics are still widely regarded as the class of drugs most effective for treating diabetic kidney disease. In rare instances, medications that target the RAAS must be combined to achieve optimum blood pressure control. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are another viable option when RAAS blockers fail or are not tolerated. SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly lower blood pressure, particularly in diabetic patients who are African American. While there are several classes of medications that can successfully treat hypertension, there are no universal cures. The issue is that certain medications are more successful in controlling hypertension than others. According to numerous studies, the most effective hypotensive agents minimise the high levels of albuminuria and slow kidney disease progression in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics, respectively. In treating diabetic nephropathy, RAAS-blocking medications are the most prevalent option; however, various specialists also favour the usage of non-RAAS-blocking drugs, specifically SGLT-2 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors.The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to block the formation of angiotensin II is the gold standard for treating nephropathy in patients with diabetes. A recent case study revealed that both ACEIs and ARBs benefitted formic acid/alzfheimer's disease (FAD) patients. It was shown that the use of ACE inhibitors lowered the level of Ang II by competing with angiotensin 2 receptor 1 (AT1). It was subsequently found that angiotensin 2 receptor 2 (AT2"}

One exception is sulfasalazine, which is considered safe because the ingredients pyrimethamine and sulfapyridine are each teratogenic independently. However, there is evidence to demonstrate a lack of teratogenicity for sulfasalazine when used in pregnant IBD women. Sulfasalazine is thought to be the treatment of choice in women wishing to conceive. When their disease is controlled with sulfasalazine, women can be safely conceived and treated with sulfasalazine throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding .The azasulfhonic (5-aminosalicylic) acid drugs have been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly when used during the first trimester of pregnancy, so these drugs should be avoided in the first trimester.Methotrexate is potentially teratogenic and should be avoided in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester due to fetal risk .Thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenic properties ."}

Undeniably, the most common root cause of immunosuppression, however, is immunosuppressive medication. In normal healthy individuals, immunosuppressive medication has immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects that are essential in treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The intended effect of these medications is to suppress an overactive immune system during inflammation to restore immune homeostasis and balance, i.e., the adjustment of overactive T cells, auto-reactive B cells, and overproduction of inflammatory mediators by monocytes/macrophages . In skilled hands, these drugs can be exceptionally effective but, ultimately, they blunt the body\u2019s ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility and lowering the body\u2019s threshold for infection."}

The maximum benefit [JOI ratings about 15\u201325] was obtained when the antibiotics were used within the first few days or weeks after the bite. Antibiotic treatment beyond this time period will have considerably less benefit although the risk of progression to late disease is quite low with or without antibiotic treatment. For example, in a recent study from Sweden, 91 cases of erythema migrans received either oral antibiotics with doxycycline for 10 days (55 patients) or no antibiotic treatment (36 patients). Forty-two percent of the 36 patients in the control group all had complete recovery while there was not a single patient who had severe disease in this group. In contrast, among the 55 patients who were treated the failure rate was 23 percent. In other words the risk was reduced by almost one half by proper treatment. Despite the lack of evidence from the U.S. the general recommendation is that all cases of erythema migrans be treated as soon as possible and with at least doxycycline, 100\u2013200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days. The reason for this recommendation is that although the risks of developing long term lyme disease after erythema migrans are now relatively low, they may rise during the next few years and become higher than is advised in some European recommendations."}

{"text": "Question: would standard urinalysis detect kidney stones? \n ### Answer: Provide examples using the values in Table 1 \u2298 Table 2 to explain how these parameters relate to kidney stones (lit. Stone Diseases: Hypercalciuria Following a crystallization event, calcium oxalate is typically the initial \u201cnidus\u201d. The most common site of deposition is the renal papilla, where no fluid comes into close contact with tubular cells and there is poor solute transport capacity. (Unless deposited in the renal pelvis, calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals that have grown large enough to block the lumen of the renal tubule dissociate within the tubule, resulting in \u201ccalcium nephropathy,\u201d without destroying the tubule until later stages, when the crystal is large enough to physically traverse the cell and disrupt transport or cause epithelial cell death. Stone disease is also fairly uniform in that it grows and is composed of hydroxyapatite. Created by Jason H. Morse, Ph.D. Candidate, Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). Report in a manuscript or prominent quality scientific journalGood assessments of this issue should also explain how crystals of calcium oxalates may dissociate from the embedded area (I couldn\u2019t find out what the embedded area is). It may also be worthwhile to explain pathophysiology of urinary tract infections, i.e., how infection of kidney tissue may begin from a urinary tract infection. Since the crystals are likely formed in the urinary tract, it would be interesting to know if an infection of the kidney tissue should follow a kidney stone infection. (I couldn\u2019t find any information that describes a logical sequence of events on how a urinary tract infection may progress to a kidney tissue infection, especially in the \u2018mild and severe form of kidney tissue infections\u2019 situations). Would the cause of short vs long term baseline urinary tract infections lead to different manifestations of the tissue infection? I mean, if a mild response to a short term UTI (due to less kidney stone detection) eventually stages to a severe kidney tissue infection, they will also likely have a technologically mediated reason to complain of a phenomenon that is associated kidney tissue infections. If this explanation is understandable, it may be worthwhile to try to explain this. If"}
