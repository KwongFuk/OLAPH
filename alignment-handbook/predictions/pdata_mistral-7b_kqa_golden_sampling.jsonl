Sometimes its very hard to store, but if you find a private pharacy that can give you your prescription with no time-frame, its possible. However!\n\nYou would not necessarily need a prescription either. In the UK when a GP hands a prescription to a pharmacy, the pharmacy can fill it without the doc even seeing you. Of course, this won't help you if you don't have a GP.\n\nYou see, we normally go to the GP only to get the prescription.\n\nI'd suggest you just get your quality MDMA from the net though.

Better stay away if you want quality MDMA don't you think?\n\nOh and if you don't have a GP just go to A+E a couple of times a head with somethinf major, you'll get a letter in the post and it's all up to you to decide which surgery to go to afterwards.\n\n> Sorry a bit off topic. But is cosmetic surgery in a way kinda becoming \"normal\" nowadays?\n\nI plan to have breast implants. They are talking about a new type of implant that only requires a local anesthetic and takes 15 minutes. It sounds so easy that it must have downsides.\n\nNo downside that I know of.

Although patients are not being routinely asked to have tests for COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses, we do need to think very carefully about it.\n\nBelow is a summary of some of the guidance based advice and I know that milk it is one size fits all but broadly it applies. Please don\u2019t infect people especially those over a certain age or with pre-existing medical conditions and especially the small 8% of people who actually die with confirmed COVID-19 illness.\n\n(This an updated summary)\n\nFever\n\nIf you have a fever (fever is a body temperature is 38 degrees or above) it is unlikely that you will have COVID-19. Most people with a fever will not have a virus. If you are well otherwise we would recommend you can go to work, to church, to school.\n\nIt is useful to call the family doctor\u2019s office to assess whether they are going to send you away or treat you and would prefer if they knew you were coming. Also, remember if you have a \u201chigh temperature of at least 37.8\u00b0C\u201d, you will be turned away at A and E if you even attempt to go, see here, so phone ahead.\n\nThat said do not go to the surgery. Go to www.111.nhs.uk or call NHS 111 if you have other worrying symptoms, are struggling to breathe of have any other problems. Dialling NHS 111 is not quick nor efficient service it rarely lasts longer than 20 mins and they will advise you to see your health provider.\n\nCough\n\nCough is not uncommon in the winter months, if it is mild and you have no other symptoms your are unlikely to have COVID-19. Please see the points above etc if you are well, otherwise go to the NHS 111, www111.nhs.uk website to see if they recommend you visit you GP.\n\nWheezing\n\nWheezing is rare in the context of COVID-19.

Our noses excrete odoriferous substances routinely, as do our neighbours, and such a routine acrimony can be virulent to our sensibilities. Expulsions do not add up to morbidity, or even mortality; but maybe Moppability.\n\nGas-caused excretions from our lungs, such as wind, faeculent flatus, foul flatus, or fartodets, are not morbid either. They are just that: Ass Products. However, in the right condition, our respiratory excretions do indicate ill health. But they can also indicate naughty health.\n\nExpectoration, at least from one of the most used bodily orifices, commonly indicates the onset, agitation and accentuation of an infectious process. Coughed out green phlegm, together, for example with a deep backache, inflamed eyes, chills, nausea and a high fever, is indicative of hitroyphyly (a Membai indigenous disorder), aggravated by incessant rolling, scratching and poking, static electricity and a Coryne bacterium infection.

In this case, please avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands or rough handling of whiteboards or pens. Consult our nurse\u2019s office staff at 916.485-4599 with any questions about this.\n\nIf you develop an unusual rash, sensitivity to the sun, pain in the stomach, or develop red eyes, please check with a doctor.\n\nColds are caused by viruses which are contagious. Contagiousness may continue for several days after the runny nose and cough have gone away. In general, you can return to school or day care after you are fever free for 24 hours. Flu is also contagious and it usually remains contagious for 5 to 7 days depending on whether or not the person has antiviral medication.\n\nHow can I prevent infections?\n\n- Wash hands often with soap and water, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth! Keep your fingernails short to avoid a place for germs to hide.\n- Cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow or into a handkerchief, not your hand. Throw a tissue after one use in the trash.\n- Get plenty of rest and exercise and eat healthy foods.\n- Don\u2019t share utensils or drink bottles for several days after you recover from an illness.\n- Wear sandals instead of shoes in the shower and changing room of a public place.\n- Prevent spread of lice or scabies by washing sheet and blanket covers with hot water and soap. Wear long pants all year. Wash hair with mild shampoo and be sure not to share combs or bows. Also do not share hats, helmets, pillow cases, blankets, scarves, or any other personal articles for at least one week after the person has been treated. If a child has lice and cannot wear a hat at school, a cap may be worn.\n\nAm I contagious with disease by having body", "It depends on which one you have, and how long after the onset of symptoms you were doing the same. From the age of eight to ten, children experience signs of the virus meanwhile, coughing can last from two weeks up to a month or even longer. Duration of contagiousness varies, as Aids are multisystem disorders which cause infection.\n\nSymptoms of influenza can start a week after infection and sometimes even later, as it can be as long as one month. The investigation must be started early so that all measurements can be taken, and the infection can be stopped if started. Antibiotics are ineffective in curing cold, sinus infection also does not work out the doctor if asked.\n\nIf you are thinking about the duration of how long you are with cold fever and other symptoms, infected person discharges that virus eventually within one week of beginning the nasal discharge, but at a reduced level of expression after 2days. This slow change of discharge pattern from prominent to subtle raises a false sense of assurance in treating flu with antibiotics. Viruses never infect someone a second time.\n\nViruses caused one time infections rather than recurrence. Some strains are more virulent that others and some are capable of recurrence. During the third or fourth week of illness, nasal exudate has mostly disappeared, but there are isolated reports of it lasting up to one month. Cough is a much later and prolonged manifestation of the viral respiratory infections. Through virus contact, mouth muscles can reach a maximum of three feet.\n\nInfluenza (seasonal to some people) is called \u2018flu,\u2019 characterized by cough, runny nose, blocked nose, and general body weakness with fatigue. It can infect strains among pigs, contagiousness depends upon specific viral strains causing) People suffering from influenza can spread the virus to infecting others. The infectious period can last up to seven days, although it will be shortened if coughing stops for two days or more.\n\nAm I contagious with colds? This very well known question has some valid answers provided by scientific studies that researchers have done in the lab. When you know all of these flu\u2019s underlying concepts, then you can easily understand the time duration which you are contagious. The most common of this duration is about 4-7days.", "The respiratory infections are contagious before the patient develops symptoms. Most people infected with respiratory virus do not realise that they have an infection because many respiratory infections do not cause symptoms that are even very noticeable. And if they do cause symptoms, they are often confused for common colds. It is not known how far these respiratory viruses are spread. But as the symptoms will often go away without treatment for about 48 hours, measures should be taken to prevent swallowing anything with the infected virus. Bacterial pneumonias are not contagious.\n\nCan everyone with respiratory infection be treated with antibiotics?\n\nNo, antibiotics should only be used if bacterial pneumonia is diagnosed. The majority of the respiratory viral infections are viral and should not be treated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics against viral respiratory infections may cause the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics that would be necessary in case of bacterial pneumonia.\n\nIs it necessary to take antibiotics for respiratory viral infection?\n\nAntibiotics should not be prescribed for virus infections. The most effective way to fight viral respiratory infections is to increase fluid intake and the necessary rest. The more you eat, the more energy you can count on and the faster you heal. If you have been prescribed antibiotics for respiratory infection and you still experience symptoms such as fever, chills, and an overall feeling of illness, seek professional help immediately. As both viral and bacterial respiratory diseases can be becoming acute, they can become pneumonia.\n\n Can I become immune to respiratory infections?\n\nMost of respiratory infections like influenza, RSV are associated with repeated immune transformation. So yes, a repeated higher dose of infection will produce more antibodies than that of a milder form of the same disease. The same principle can happen with COVID-19. However, as the sanitary conditions are poor in the world and we are not vaccinated against COVID-19, there are global premises for more epidemics.\n\nWhich vitamin helps to fight infections such as coronavirus and the flu?\n\nVitamins are micronutrients that are necessary for survival.

Herpes cannot be pre-tested, or tested for ahead of time, neither can it be rationally prevented except when you abstain from sexual contact.\n\nGenital herpes is usually caused by the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).\n\nHSV-2, which is the usual source of herpes is more often than not, found in the genital area.\n\nPeople who have been infected with HSV-2 often go without symptoms. However, they can spread the virus to others. Even when symptoms present themselves, they may be mild and sometimes mistaken for other conditions.\n\nIt is of utmost importance to note that there is no cure for herpes, as this virus does not go away. It lies dormant in the cell and when things start heating up in the body, the virus releases certain substances into the skin to stimulate the nerve endings, thereby causing the blood vessels to dilate, thereby causing the sores. Eventually the cells start itching and the herpes lesions peal on their own leaving behind marks that often thereafter become inflamed, moist and painful. Thereafter, it can then heal spontaneously or on its own after a few weeks.\n\nThere is no cure for herpes, but there are oral medicines called antiviral drugs that can treat the symptoms, shorten outbreaks and prevent these outbreaks from spreading to other areas or to other people.\n\nPregnant women with herpes, are in turn more susceptible to infections during the third trimester and perineal tears during delivery. It can also pose serious consequences on the baby if in case the baby develops the viruses affecting the baby\u2019s brain, eyes or other organs so it is vital for them to be delivered through caesarean section.\n\nPre-herpes tests may be conducted in our SVS laboratories with blood tests, cell culture tests and antigens or antibod", "Receiving a positive HPV result can provoke a lot of questions, especially around how HPV impacts other areas of the body and how it varies from other common STIs.\n\n## Genital Herpes and HPV\n\nGenital Herpes (via the herpes simplex virus) has several differences when compared with HPV. Herpes is an extremely common infection amongst adults in the UK, and is spread through anal, oral and genital sex. Following exposure to Herpes, a number of symptoms can occur, including:\n\n- Painful blisters which can then break open and scab;\n- Itching, tingling or burning sensation in the affected area; and\n- Swollen lymph nodes in the groin area.\n\nThe Herpes virus is fairly unique in that it produces a cold sore on occasion, aside from the initial outbreak when it\u2019s first contracted. In contrast, HPV regards the genital and anal areas only.\n\n## Chlamydia\n\nIt\u2019s easy to confuse Chlamydia with both HPV and Genital Herpes, though this STI has several differences.\n\nDespite being incredibly common in the UK (with infection rates greater than cancer), Chlamydia is almost always a symptom-free infection, although this only lasts for 10 weeks post-exposure. Therefore, in many cases there are no symptoms to indicate that you\u2019ve contracted an STI at all.\n\nAlthough the symptoms are remarkably similar to both HPV and Herpes, Chlamydia has one key difference; it can affect your throat. Whereas HPV and Herpes are transmitted through sexual contact only, Chlamydia is a contactable infection, meaning that it can be transmitted through oral sex. The symptoms of Chlamydia can include:\n\n- Vaginal discharge (it may be watery or milky, or have a strong smell);\n- Anal discharge, with itchy bottom and pains during defecation;\n- Inflamed throat and cough;\n- Testicular pain;\n- Pain or swelling around the testicles; and\n- Painful or traumatic urination, if you\u2019re suffering from urethritis.\n\n## Safe Sex\n\nDid you know that you can contract HPV through oral sex? It\u2019s true", "Here are some tips that\u2019ll help you get those pores to open up: Right products: Exfoliation is usually recommended in general with chemical peels.

You need to pay close attention to the appearance of the cold sore to avoid the problems shown in the picture.\n\nIn the photo above, you can see a perfect picture of the difference between cold sore and canker sore. I want to turn your attention to three things:\n\n1. The canker sore at the back of my mouth is \u201cnaked\u201d. That is \u2013 there is no skin left at the site of the problem. The skin is eroded, raw skin is visible.\n2. The cold sore is full-blown in a single day. There is no lead-up time that canker sores require. Canker sores develop silently, for hours to a day or two, before they turn into an open sore and even longer, before the pain interferes your life. Cold sores take only hours for the first signs to turn into a visible problem.\n\n## Cold sore vs canker sore medicine\n\nHow to tell a difference between cold sore and canker sore from a medicinal treatment point of view?\n\nCold sore vs canker sore medicine: Typically, anything for treating canker sore will not help cold sores. Additionally, anything for treating cold sores does not help canker sores.\n\nWhy is that? The mechanism of how a cold sore is spreading and do the damages differs from the mechanism of a canker sore. To get very technical \u2013 HSV, the virus behind a cold sore problem, is infectious and does not spread from one open sore to the next. On the other hand, canker sores are caused by irritants \u2013 as a rule of thumb \u2013 you do not spread them.\n\nYou are indeed right \u2013 zovirax is a very good example of that. I see patients that use zovirax for canker sores.

We strongly recommend that patients with these conditions work under the supervision of a health care provider.\n\nAnswer:\n\nDr. Tammy Wong replies:\n\n- Cold sores occur from the herpes-virus; unfortunately, there is no known cure, but there are antiviral medicines that work very well when taken in the early stages of the virus reactivation. However, with your sensitivity to medicines, you would certainly need to have a careful discussion with your physician to come up with the safest treatment possible.\n- Mouth ulcers/canker sores, as you know, are wholly different (for dental guidance, please view our previous post, \u201cWhat Do We Do About Canker Sores?\u201d). These typically occur when there is a slight injury that causes trauma to the inner lining of your mouth. Generally, they\u2019ll heal within a few days, but nutrition can certainly play a role in how quickly it heals, and prevention may just be the best medicine. Be sure to get enough B-vitamins (rather than just one) and also do your best to avoid injury (this can be difficult in the Sjogren\u2019s patient\u2026let go of the toothbrush, refrain from biting on them, and try to remember the one that popped up this morning \u2013 don\u2019t bite it). I also review the herbal factor for it too. In this patient population a topical application of food grade sodium bicarbonate (Sea/Sally, Polident or Pensyl) can be used as a mouth rinse that I\u2019ve seen take a whopper of an ulcer down to seemingly nothing in a very short time. Sodium bicarbonate works by lowering the pH to a basic (more alkaline) which this virus strain will not tolerate. It effectively \u2018short circuits\u2019 it. Though it makes a lot of sense, and is not toxic with topical applications like this, it might not be tolerated by all. I\u2019d apply a small amount to a portion of the ulcer to begin with to make sure it\u2019s tolerated.\n\nCertainly vitamin C is extremely helpful for tissue repair, and its other antioxidant", "I know I know off topic but I\u2019ve been taking good care of my face but then I\u2019ve been getting the weirdest reaction on my right cheek.

Suggestions for intercourse with 5 disc protrusion and large beaks between L5 and S1?  Thanks.\n\nHello,\n\nMuscle relaxants can be effective for treating pain in the back. Depending on the circumstances, many of these medications can be used safely during pregnancy. Experts do advise, though, that many of these drugs can cross into the developing fetus through the placenta, so the risks to the pregnancy haven\u2019t been fully explored yet. Rather than taking them every day, it might be safe to take them on an as-needed basis.\n\nIt\u2019s important for women who are pregnant to consult their physician. They know the weight of pro and cons of each drug for each circumstance.\n\nLet me suggest modifications to yoga poses which are safe for pregnancy.\n\nThe Bridge Pose is very useful for pelvic pain. You should keep your arms by your sides and not lift your body up on the bridge. You can also just use this reclined position to rest on. The goal is to relax and open your pelvis.\n\nBack bending poses are also helpful. The Cobra pose is very gentle but can help with back pain and is safe during pregnancy. Lie on your belly with your legs extended behind you and palms by your chest, shoulder width apart. On inhale, lift your head, chest, and shoulders off the ground, without lifting your pelvis. Turn your palms up towards ceiling. Press into your palms for balance while gently curving your spine. Draw your navel in slightly to help protect your back. You can get back to starting position by bringing your upper body down slowly, and then extend your legs and roll slowly to on your side.\n\nCat pose can also bring back comfort. From the position of the Cobra pose, move back slowly to the starting position, bring your head in between your arms slowly. Stay relaxed. Curve your spine and simply relax your upper body.\n\nYou can always start doing pelvic Mobility, easy back pain exercises and breathing which will help you be comfortable and relax your women\u2019s health markers.

No one seems to be recommending melatonin either.\n\nWhat supplements would you guys recommend against or for (in general) if I'm dealing with pain daily. TNP still creeps onto the knees at night.

She can\u2019t use NSAIDs due to liver problems, nor narcotics due to possible addiction. My wife suffers from nothing horribly severe as far as illness goes, but it\u2019s enough to concern her as well as me plus the kids. Unfortunately, no doctor wants to prescribe it. It\u2019s a very frustrating issue as my wife needs something to take the edge off. This obviously pisses me off. I would appreciate any insight or ideas on the topic.

They do increase the number of opsonizing antibodies in the blood serum. This seems likely to reduce the colony forming ability of white blood cells, and these drugs must be cautiously used in the treatment of patients with leukemia. Hydroxylated forms of the drug include hydrochlorothiazide, which is fourteen times less active antimalarially than chloroquine.\nHydroxychlorothiazide was first used in the United States under the name Plaquenil.

{"Question": "Anything I can do for the congestion?", "Free_form_answer": "Yes, there are several medicines and home treatments that can help relieve congestion.\n\nNasal corticosteroid sprays reduce inflammation and swelling in the nose. Some are available over-the-counter and they are recommended for the treatment of persistent nasal allergy symptoms.\nNasal antihistamine sprays may also help relieve congestion. \n\nNasal decongestant sprays can be beneficial for reducing the swelling of the blood vessels and tissues within the nasal passages. However, they should not be used for more than 2-3 days at a time. Frequent or prolonged use can cause \"rebound congestion\" when the decongestant is stopped, which can lead to a cycle of dependency on decongestant sprays. Their short-term use means they are better for treating nasal congestion caused by a cold rather than allergies.\n\nNasal irrigation or saline sprays can rinse out mucus and allergens from the nasal passages. Elevation of the head at night may help as congestion is sometimes worse when lying down.\n\nOral decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), are also available.

First, make sure you\u2019re using the correct oil for your car. BMW recommends using a 5W-30 oil for the 325i. If you\u2019re using a different oil, it could be causing the congestion.\n\nSecond, check your air filter. A dirty air filter can cause the engine to run rich, which can lead to congestion. Replace the air filter if it\u2019s dirty.\n\nThird, check your fuel injectors. If they\u2019re clogged, it can cause the engine to run rich, which can lead to congestion. Clean the fuel injectors if they\u2019re clogged.\n\nFourth, check your spark plugs. If they\u2019re fouled, it can cause the engine to run rich, which can lead to congestion. Replace the spark plugs if they\u2019re fouled.\n\nFifth, check your mass air flow sensor. If it\u2019s dirty, it can cause the engine to run rich, which can lead to congestion. Clean the mass air flow sensor if it\u2019s dirty.\n\nSixth, check your throttle body. If it\u2019s dirty, it can cause the engine to run rich, which can lead to congestion.

Golfer Lee Trevino contracted MRSA after his appendix was removed. And Tom Nichole said prison guards did nothing when he complained of staph symptoms.\n\nTheir stories are only a tip of the iceberg. Contracting staph bacteria - often transmitted through breaks in the skin - is one of the hazards faced by prison inmates and the staff charged with their care.\n\nAccording to a report requested by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees from the University of Albany\u2019s School of Public Health, new information has been discovered about MRSA in the general public, and many corrections employers are unaware of this new information.\n\n\u201cThey just assumed drug-resistant bacteria are coming from inmates,\u201d said Nathan Bull, research manager for AFSCME and a University of Albany graduate. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have a good handle on where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nIn August, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported a significant reduction in the number of inmates diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The number of tests administered also dropped, substantially.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my belief that there has been an increase in awareness among staff and inmates, and there has been more aggressive screening in certain facilities,\u201d Thornton said.\n\nAccording to the AFSCME report, would-be inmates should undergo testing for sexually transmitted disease before admission into prison. However, an inmate\u2019s first day in prison is the first day of his or her medical screening.\n\nNichole, 52, said prisoners at the Central California Women\u2019s Facility were placed near showers during an outbreak of a highly staph-resistant strain of MRSA.\n\n\u201cIf someone has lice or MRSA, they immediately put them by the showers so they can wash them,\u201d he said.", "This is complex.

What the herbs can help is to make your child strong enough to withstand attacks like this.\n\nQ & A:\n\nQ: My husband lost his job as an architect two and a half months ago. I told him to take a break and not find another job immediately while we got used to the idea of not receiving a monthly salary. He was so unhappy and blues which dampened my mood, too. I brought him to churches, prayed and asked friends to pray for him, but he kept on feeling bad. It made me worry. Was my timing wrong? A friend told me to take him to a shaman as his depression was getting worse. Is this wise?\n\nA: Very often when something significant happens in life, it may cause depression or unhappiness. The situation then feels overwhelming. People need time to come to terms with the situation and find their strength to stand on their feet when they are down. The more people around them believe that they can work things out for themselves and be the reason for their and their family members\u2019 happiness, the quicker they are able to overcome difficult situations.\n\nQ: My mother (aged 76) has a heart condition and has not gone out of the house for more than 20 years. Like most stay-at-home moms she is sad, lonely and bitter. At times she gets angry for no reasons. I worry that if this continues, she will suffer from dementia.\n\nA: Let\u2019s look at this situation from a different angle. Why should she get angry for no reason? Why should she suffer from dementia? She may be hiding her true emotions all these years, but not without cost. Keeping her emotions in check in this manner can give rise to dormant physical and emotional energy that can turn sour if not channeled positively.\n\nQ: I am feeling a kind of itchiness which I have never felt before.

The stomach flu refers to the set of symptoms resulting from illnesses that include gastroenteritis, and the flu denotes infections which are also known as influenza. The stomach flu is the most common name for a few different gastrointestinal illnesses. You can share these stomach flu viruses through direct contact, contaminated food or water, and breathing in of contaminated droplets in the air.\n\nThe stomach flu is labeled as such due to the symptoms of vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea, which usually falls into the viral category. Types of viruses that fall into this category include norovirus, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea, as well as hepatitis A, which is passed on through unsanitary cooking procedures and conditions, poor hygiene and eating tainted food. There are other bacterial stomach bugs that can also have these symptoms.\n\nOther symptoms are commonly pains in the back, stomach cramps, high fever and chills, headaches, and muscle aches. Fever with stomach flu is common and the other symptoms can be accompanied as well. It is also possible to have the 3 day flu with these symptoms as well. Some people may only experience diarrhea.\n\nIt is not possible to contract flu and stomach flu at the same time. However, you can contract the stomach flu at the same time as the cold and flu viruses. In fact, you\u2019ll always develop a bacterial stomach flu along with the cold or flu since the stomach flu is the only virus that causes damage in the gastrointestinal lining will make you susceptible to it. The cold and flu are passed on through the direct contact of infectious secretions from the coughing and sneezing of the person that is sick as a result of their respiratory infections.\n\nSymptoms for both may include a runny nose, cough, or nasal congestion. They may also share some of the other symptoms like chills, general body aches, and dry cough.\n\n## Bacterial and Viral Stomach Flu\n\nStomach flu vs. food poisoning is another distinction that is often made. Stomach flu which is caused by bacteria, typically salmon", "The flu, short for influenza, is a viral infection in the nose, throat, and lungs that essentially causes us to have a cough, sore throat, runny nose and in severe cases can cause high fever, headache, and body aches. The classic symptoms of the flu are sudden onset of high fever, body aches, sore throat, cough, runny or stuffy nose, headache, feeling weak, muscle fatigue,  and loss of appetite. Symptoms start to get better after 1 or 2 weeks, sometimes with lingering fatigue and cough. The flu is caused by a highly contagious virus that is usually spread by droplets released into the air when an infected person with the flu coughs or sneezes. In the US alone, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from the flu every year and in severe cases, more than 20,000 die as a result of flu-related complications. The flu has traditionally occurred during the cold season but due to global warming and hot weather year round, it has also become a problem even in the summer.\n\nWhat about the stomach flu?\n\nNope\u2026.he is a myth. It is most often a diagnosis made by inexperienced medical practitioners when the chief complaint or current concern is stomach pain or flu-like symptoms. There is no such thing as a stomach flu. Stomach pain can be due to any number of causes in your GI tract. I hope I took my stomach out by pressing it when I served in the Navy.\n\nWhen someone gets stomach pain, they often don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong and sometimes the amount of diagnostic work up or medication that may be prescribed makes them feel more uncomfortable. Some say they have IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. While the cause of IBS is unknown, it is not a type of flu and must be managed with proper dieting.\n\nStomach flu is often confused with the gastroenteritis (GE) virus or norovirus but this is usually limited to a contagious illness with a sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea. Vomiting usually beats diarrhea and the incubation period is within 1 to 2 days and lasts 1 to 3 days. It is spread through contamination with vomit or feces.

The serotonin chemicals (specifically the antigistemics) include the serotonin h1 and h2 blockers, and they target the special site in the brain.\n\nWith these serotonin medications, some research studies have shown that these clinical depression remedies can delay gastric emptiness, and they have been shown to enhance nausea signs.\n\nThe serotonin anti-emetics are serotonin h2 amino acid receptor antagonists and they generally lead to increased vomiting and greater nausea. The serotonin receptor antagonists are the most common clinical depression medications and they are utilized in the treatment of children and youth.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-serotonin medications or the antigistemics are those drugs that do not target the special receptor itself, but rather coffee and gastrin which are stimulated by the contact with specific stimuli. caffeine and gastrin are believed to be stimulated by 5-HT3+ serotonin, so by using 5-HT3 inhibitors in combination with an antigest, it can decrease symptoms of nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute in the US has on their website that there are 4 types of nausea medications that they have studied and the fourth type of medication that they have studied is the neuro-tactile emetic antagonists. These chemicals deprive buy cbd oil online of amino acids that trigger other chemical reactions to be generated in the brain.\n\nAccording to research, drugs that are taken should not be taken at the same time as antigenic antivals, and researchers also found that in the early trials that were concluded, certain anti-emetics had harmful effects.\n\nAfter 270 years, there has been a clear-up of controversies surrounding the consumption of anti-emetic drugs, and the questions this brought up concerning the potential for drug resistance were not readily addressed. So in conclusion, anti-emetic medications should be used with caution.\n\nAs for the dangers of fasting, Lean Cuisine has a cookbook that I highly recommend to read, Exper"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4314, "rouge1_r": 0.1486, "rouge1_f1": 0.2211, "rouge2_p": 0.1683, "rouge2_r": 0.0576, "rouge2_f1": 0.0859, "rougel_p": 0.3137, "rougel_r": 0.1081, "rougel_f1": 0.1608, "bleurt": 0.4861, "bert_score_p": 0.8111, "bert_score_r": 0.8121, "bert_score_f1": 0.8116, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4706, "rouge1_r": 0.1379, "rouge1_f1": 0.2133, "rouge2_p": 0.0396, "rouge2_r": 0.0115, "rouge2_f1": 0.0179, "rougel_p": 0.2255, "rougel_r": 0.0661, "rougel_f1": 0.1022, "bleurt": 0.3026, "bert_score_p": 0.808, "bert_score_r": 0.818, "bert_score_f1": 0.813, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4902, "rouge1_r": 0.1404, "rouge1_f1": 0.2183, "rouge2_p": 0.0792, "rouge2_r": 0.0225, "rouge2_f1": 0.0351, "rougel_p": 0.2941, "rougel_r": 0.0843, "rougel_f1": 0.131, "bleurt": 0.3137, "bert_score_p": 0.8127, "bert_score_r": 0.8092, "bert_score_f1": 0.811, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4902, "rouge1_r": 0.1433, "rouge1_f1": 0.2217, "rouge2_p": 0.0594, "rouge2_r": 0.0172, "rouge2_f1": 0.0267, "rougel_p": 0.2549, "rougel_r": 0.0745, "rougel_f1": 0.1153, "bleurt": 0.3063, "bert_score_p": 0.8062, "bert_score_r": 0.8168, "bert_score_f1": 0.8115, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4804, "rouge1_r": 0.1222, "rouge1_f1": 0.1948, "rouge2_p": 0.0594, "rouge2_r": 0.015, "rouge2_f1": 0.024, "rougel_p": 0.2549, "rougel_r": 0.0648, "rougel_f1": 0.1034, "bleurt": 0.3213, "bert_score_p": 0.8026, "bert_score_r": 0.806, "bert_score_f1": 0.8043, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 85.71428571428571}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4706, "rouge1_r": 0.1371, "rouge1_f1": 0.2124, "rouge2_p": 0.0594, "rouge2_r": 0.0172, "rouge2_f1": 0.0267, "rougel_p": 0.2157, "rougel_r": 0.0629, "rougel_f1": 0.0973, "bleurt": 0.3275, "bert_score_p": 0.8153, "bert_score_r": 0.8196, "bert_score_f1": 0.8174, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

Most of the adverse effects so far associated with cannabis, such as impairments in short-term memory, coordination and judgment,2 come from products that contain THC as well as CBD, Cooper said, but we need to do more studies to find out for sure whether CBD has fewer risks.

Cysts that form on the endometrium are known as endometrial cysts.\n\nEndometriosis is actually a complex endocrine disorder that develops because of prolonged estrogen stimulation that is unopposed. Consequently, endometriosis is also called as 'Ovarian dysgenesis,' since the entire organism is long exposed to an unopposed excess of estrogen, which results in disordered intraorganism communication.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nAny female of childbearing age can be diagnosed with this condition, but it occurs mostly in women of reproductive age ( 13 to 45 years). Currently, approximately 176 million women worldwide are affected by this problem.\n\n- Endometriosis is generally present in 2 out of 5 women with infertility problem.\n- Women who adopted very late or never had children.\n- Women who have a history of miscarriage and stillbirth.\n- Women with irregular menstrual cycles or with menstruation having heavy bleeding.\n\nNevertheless, the painfulness and sever", "I had a pap smear and blood work done on December 16th.

The disease is common in Mediterranean countries and populations of Jewish descent. Most patients carry an aberrant gene for the FMF protein mevalonate kinase. The widely prescribed anti-fatigue drug CRECOXRIN is a patented blend of colchicine. Colchicine crosses the placenta and is teratogenic in animals. The fetal liver needs to be removed at birth to avoid mortality, and oxygen may need to be supplemented in the first two weeks post-natal to save the lungs. CRECOXRIN may present higher danger than pure colchicine due to the different toxic metabolites in the formulation.\n\nConsequently, you may want to be VERY careful taking products containing Colchicine for gout, arthritis, or your OA symptoms.

These drugs are used to relieve the common side effects of allergies.\n\n14 Answers | 11 Parts\n\n## Part 1 of 11: About drowsiness and antihistamines\n\nMany medicines in the family of antihistamines, like loratadine and alcohol, also contribute to drowsiness. All medicines that contain any level of alcohol have a sedative effect. Since antihistamines are used to counteract the symptoms of allergic reaction that cause drowsiness, a lot of people falsely believe that loratadine is addictive or that it can cause drowsiness! However, this conclusion is wrong.\n\nLoratadine is a non-addictive medication that is not comparable to antidepressants like amitriptyline or Prozac. If you take loratadine as directed by your doctor, the most common side effects of loratadine withdrawal after two to three weeks are drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness and headache.\n\nSo, is there any benefit to taking loratadine for allergic rhinitis? As a general rule, antihistamines can cause variables such as drowsiness, dry mouth and headache, which loratadine in particular have been shown to be more severe. The main reason why loratadine is generally recommended is because many non-estrogen medicines have neurotoxicity, i.e. they can cause convulsions. Benadryl is the most commonly used antihistamine for allergic rhinitis, and one of the drugs used most often in both laser and topical laser treatment.\n\nBecause Benadryl is so widespread and used for nearly everyone who has a stuffy, runny nose, dry throat, or dry, red eyes, it's hard to find.

The reasons are simple - they are found in the relatively small number of microorganisms in the semen, and in their small resistance, and in difficulty of easy contact with the female genital organs.\n\nHowever, testicular pain associated with chlamydia can actually develop in men. It is transmitted in the same way as among female organs, this is direct sexual contact.\n\nIn other words, if the male organism has already been infected with the chlamydia, then already in the ejection of ejaculate it is transmitted to the female partner in pathogens. This means that if a woman is not warned, there is the probability of its penetration into the cavity of the uterus and the subsequent spread of infection to other organs and systems, in particular, to the genitals of a woman.\n\nIn addition, cases are known in the literature when men after the acquisition of chlamydia fall ill with orchitis, testicular pain due to inflammation. In order for this to happen, it is still necessary that this worm tick transmitted to the male genitals.\n\nIf such a pathological process develops, then a man can conduct a painful process in the form of testicular pain.

Chlamydia Trachomatis: An Overview\n\nChlamydia Trachomatis (Trachoma bacterium) is a leading cause of sexually transmitted diseases throughout the United States and other countries around the world.\n\nIt appears that more than 50% of those infected are unaware that they are even infected with Chlamydia. Lack of symptoms observed by the infected person is the main reason Chlamydia has spread so widely throughout the world for years.\n\nSome of the symptoms of Chlamydia include pressure in the testicles that leads to mild pain especially during intercourse. When left active in the body, this infection can result in infertility in men. This is caused by a reduction in the amount of sperm produced after the infection is active.\n\nFor women who find this parasite lurking within their bodies, Chlamydia can cause the tubes on the uterus to become blocked. This prevents sperm from meeting the eggs, resulting in infertility. All of these effects are due to the chronic infection caused by Chlamydia.\n\n## 2. Chlamydia and Testicular Infections: An Analysis\n\nMedical reports show that Chlamydia infection is a common STD in men, affecting 1 to 5% of men who visit doctors for a testicular infection. An STD called Urethritis can lead to chlamydia infection. When the infection spreads far enough, the man\u2019s testicles may become affected. The bacteria that infections can be evidenced chromosomally after testing specimens\u2019 fluids, but this is very different from the main treatment for C. trachomatis bacteria.\n\nThe main treatment for Chlamydia includes doxycycline, with ciproflaxacin often substituted to help treat cystitis in women. The bacterial strains are resistant to the less effective antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, meaning treatment has to be more aggressive.\n\nIn some instances"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4914, "rouge1_r": 0.1776, "rouge1_f1": 0.2609, "rouge2_p": 0.1391, "rouge2_r": 0.05, "rouge2_f1": 0.0736, "rougel_p": 0.2672, "rougel_r": 0.0966, "rougel_f1": 0.1419, "bleurt": 0.3306, "bert_score_p": 0.815, "bert_score_r": 0.8298, "bert_score_f1": 0.8224, "hallucination": 6.666666666666667, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5, "rouge1_r": 0.1853, "rouge1_f1": 0.2704, "rouge2_p": 0.0783, "rouge2_r": 0.0288, "rouge2_f1": 0.0422, "rougel_p": 0.2155, "rougel_r": 0.0799, "rougel_f1": 0.1166, "bleurt": 0.2902, "bert_score_p": 0.7984, "bert_score_r": 0.8297, "bert_score_f1": 0.8138, "hallucination": 53.333333333333336, "comprehensive": 60.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3707, "rouge1_r": 0.2529, "rouge1_f1": 0.3007, "rouge2_p": 0.087, "rouge2_r": 0.0592, "rouge2_f1": 0.0704, "rougel_p": 0.1724, "rougel_r": 0.1176, "rougel_f1": 0.1399, "bleurt": 0.2347, "bert_score_p": 0.8266, "bert_score_r": 0.8221, "bert_score_f1": 0.8244, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4138, "rouge1_r": 0.136, "rouge1_f1": 0.2047, "rouge2_p": 0.1217, "rouge2_r": 0.0398, "rouge2_f1": 0.06, "rougel_p": 0.2759, "rougel_r": 0.0907, "rougel_f1": 0.1365, "bleurt": 0.3046, "bert_score_p": 0.8024, "bert_score_r": 0.8165, "bert_score_f1": 0.8094, "hallucination": 46.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 80.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4569, "rouge1_r": 0.1767, "rouge1_f1": 0.2548, "rouge2_p": 0.1043, "rouge2_r": 0.0401, "rouge2_f1": 0.058, "rougel_p": 0.2414, "rougel_r": 0.0933, "rougel_f1": 0.1346, "bleurt": 0.2369, "bert_score_p": 0.8133, "bert_score_r": 0.8262, "bert_score_f1": 0.8197, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4483, "rouge1_r": 0.159, "rouge1_f1": 0.2348, "rouge2_p": 0.1391, "rouge2_r": 0.0491, "rouge2_f1": 0.0726, "rougel_p": 0.25, "rougel_r": 0.0887, "rougel_f1": 0.1309, "bleurt": 0.3221, "bert_score_p": 0.8119, "bert_score_r": 0.8274, "bert_score_f1": 0.8195, "hallucination": 46.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 60.0}]}

It was prescribed by doctors in ancient Greece but lost to the modern world for a couple of millennia.\n\nTwo centuries ago, European botanists, led by French naturalist Amadeus de Dreux, examined artifacts from ancient Greece and discovered that Greek physicians had, at that time, a remedy for gout (known then as Podagra) that they obtained from a plant they called Colchis. They thought they lost the work of Hippocrates and wanted to rediscover it.\n\nThey soon identified the plant as fallpoque or autumn beauty (Colchicum autumnale), then they isolated its painkilling and inflammation-fighting substance, the alkaloid colchicine, and,  despite the revelation that it is poisonous, have been using cochicine for over two centuries to treat gout- not just gout but also other problems, including gout pain.\n\nRecent studies show that there is a link between physical exercise and obesity reduction, something that is beneficial for those who have had gout attacks. Other benefits include controlling one\u2019s cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nA study mentioned at the Hawaii International Conference on Systematic Pharmacognosy has also shown that colchicine can help those with dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypercholesterolemia. This is important as athletes and other individuals who exercise to lose weight may also have these health conditions. And if people do not take the right supplement, it can worsen the situation.\n\nOur bodies have natural limits. While there are testosterone supplements, there are also health issues that can arise from their dosage.\n\nReading it from colchicine\u2019s Wikipedia page, I\u2019d have thought it\u2019s the kind of drug you\u2019d want for using it, but a new study has confirmed that colchicine has the potential to help athletes, specifically, male athletes and those sexually active protect themselves against prostatitis/urogenital infections caused by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT).\n\nProf", "Colchicine is a medicine which has existed for over 2,000 years and it is widely used in low dosage for Gout treatment.

They were also used as far back as the 8th century to create purple dye. It was first discovered within certain geographical locations of the Caspian and Black Seas, then rose in popularity as the popularity of the flowers began to spread.\n\nColchicine was commercially introduced in the 1820s under the further scientific designation of colchicum autumnale, and became the first known medication to treat gout.\n\nAfter 40 million pounds of them were harvested in the 1880s and 1890s, colchicine became a poor substitute for cocaine: the real one for tennis elbow. This meant that both were liable to adulteration, and both could cause ill health consequences.\n\nToday, the crocus flower no longer supplies colchicine, although there is still a very low level of plant material in certain tablets and solutions. Colchicine is obtained commercially from chemical reactions involving monocolchicine, an alkaloid found in C. autumnale extracts.\n\nColchicine was used in bowling alley ball caroms to stop the ball going further than its lane. Specifically, it sticks to the ball by coating it with a colchicine derivative, thus preventing it from being hit to open lanes when bowling.\n\nHowever, colchicine may cause", "We\u2019ll start with the basics \u2013 Colchicine is a drug that\u2019s often used to treat gout and a few other conditions.\n\nBut is Colchicine an Antibiotic? Technically, No \u2013 Colchicine is not an antibiotic. Antibiotics work by killing bacteria or stopping them from producing energy or other essential stuff. Though it can fight bacteria and viruses, Colchicine doesn\u2019t stop them from producing energy or work in that way.\n\nDon\u2019t get overwhelmed; this article will guide you on why Colchicine is not an antibiotic, the side effects, when used and the uses of Colchicine, among other things.\n\nWhat is Colchicine?\n\nColchicine is the active component obtained from the plants of C. autumnale, C. al grandiflora species. Colchicine creates its anti-inflammatory action by arresting the movement of polymorphism granules. Supposition indicates that polymorphons granules are inadequate in excessive nucleotide synthesis  (De rauw,1983.\n\nMechanism of action\n\n1. Colchicine has three actions: suppression of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and migration, release of lysosomal enzymes, and whelping of phagocytosis.\n2. Colchicine diminishes the activity of the granule white cells kure and produces a dose-dependent injury of neutroph the phagocytic function when the granule cells are activated by well-defined chemicals.\n3. Colchicine, also reduces the percentage\nOf Nitrite synthesis and PG2b production by interleukin-I-activated macrophages, and impairs foreign fibrinogen depolarization response.\n4. Colchicine hinders the megakaryocyte-platelet reaction, recipients the mediation of leukocyte azurophil granules, respectively releases lysosomal enzymes of mononuclear phagocytic cells and stimulates the Is Blood platelets.\n5. It relieves the nursing of platelet aggregation in arthritic synovial fluid over mast cells activated by calcium or coll", "In brief, this is a chemical ingredient which is naturally derived from plants which are native to Spain and Italy. It specifically can be extracted from certain flowers. This substance can be appropriated to produce a form of medication which is characterized as a plant-based salt. This medication is very often used to get rid of the pain brought about by a condition known as gout. Such a salt form comes in a variety of forms, including in paste form for injections. This medication can also come in powder form as well as pill form.\n\n## General Use and Dosage Instructions\n\nThere are various instructions given to patients in order to make sure that such medications do not differ from each other when it comes to effectiveness. For instance, the powder form of medication should be dissolved in distilled water. The water will then be mixed thoroughly.\n\nThe subcutaneous forms, on the other hand, are usually given only through the veins or through muscle injections. Yet, these are administered intravenously in most cases. These injections are also available after they are dissolved in saline solution.\n\nOral forms of colchicine could be patented on the other hand, but you should always opt to consult with your assigned physician to make sure that you use the appropriate dose. The dose you use, however, can vary from one disease to another as well as for the amount of the drug that can be properly degraded and should be excreted by the body. These oral forms can also be taken at different times, depending on the condition requiring such a medication, what it is being treated for and what other medications you are taking.\n\nAs such, you must ask for expert advice if you are going to use oral medications at different times of the day. Taking oral medications at more than once a day could be risky. This is why, unless approved from your doctor, you should not double the medication in one day.\n\n## Treatment and Standard Regimen\n\nAs well as the form of the drug, the amount you use should be based on the patient\u2019s age, weight and the kind of disease you have as well as the effects of the standard dosage you have used in the past. These medications could be used for long term as well as short term basis, as well as the other medications you have used for various nerve pain issues.\n\nThe commonly used methods could include oral forms of colchicine, no matter the nature"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.2182, "rouge1_r": 0.0331, "rouge1_f1": 0.0576, "rouge2_p": 0.0741, "rouge2_r": 0.0111, "rouge2_f1": 0.0193, "rougel_p": 0.2182, "rougel_r": 0.0331, "rougel_f1": 0.0576, "bleurt": 0.7018, "bert_score_p": 0.757, "bert_score_r": 0.766, "bert_score_f1": 0.7615, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4364, "rouge1_r": 0.0727, "rouge1_f1": 0.1247, "rouge2_p": 0.0556, "rouge2_r": 0.0091, "rouge2_f1": 0.0157, "rougel_p": 0.2727, "rougel_r": 0.0455, "rougel_f1": 0.0779, "bleurt": 0.2457, "bert_score_p": 0.7859, "bert_score_r": 0.8022, "bert_score_f1": 0.794, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 37.5}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3091, "rouge1_r": 0.0714, "rouge1_f1": 0.116, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.2182, "rougel_r": 0.0504, "rougel_f1": 0.0819, "bleurt": 0.2199, "bert_score_p": 0.806, "bert_score_r": 0.8116, "bert_score_f1": 0.8088, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4, "rouge1_r": 0.0683, "rouge1_f1": 0.1167, "rouge2_p": 0.0741, "rouge2_r": 0.0125, "rouge2_f1": 0.0213, "rougel_p": 0.2545, "rougel_r": 0.0435, "rougel_f1": 0.0743, "bleurt": 0.2811, "bert_score_p": 0.7829, "bert_score_r": 0.7966, "bert_score_f1": 0.7897, "hallucination": 87.5, "comprehensive": 12.5}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4182, "rouge1_r": 0.0852, "rouge1_f1": 0.1415, "rouge2_p": 0.0926, "rouge2_r": 0.0186, "rouge2_f1": 0.031, "rougel_p": 0.2727, "rougel_r": 0.0556, "rougel_f1": 0.0923, "bleurt": 0.2804, "bert_score_p": 0.7913, "bert_score_r": 0.8175, "bert_score_f1": 0.8042, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 62.5}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.3636, "rouge1_r": 0.0476, "rouge1_f1": 0.0842, "rouge2_p": 0.0185, "rouge2_r": 0.0024, "rouge2_f1": 0.0042, "rougel_p": 0.2364, "rougel_r": 0.031, "rougel_f1": 0.0547, "bleurt": 0.346, "bert_score_p": 0.791, "bert_score_r": 0.791, "bert_score_f1": 0.791, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 37.5}]}

These changes make the host body more susceptible to infections.\n\n### This is where antibiotics come in.\n\nWhen a woman gives birth, her chances of becoming infected with roundworms are high. Women who are pregnant are also more likely to contract roundworms because their immune system is weakened. This is usually due to reduced estrogen production.\n\nWhen a woman is pregnant, she should be especially careful about using antibiotics, especially if she has been prescribed them for another condition, such as diabetes or arthritis.\n\nWhen a woman contracts the bacteria causing the roundworm, she should immediately contact her doctor. The bacteria can be treated at home with special types of medications.\n\nIf you are experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy, you can try to avoid infection by regularly cleaning your underwear and", "Hi everyone I\u2019d really appreciate advice please\nMy son is 13 and has crohns for almost 2 years.

Clindamycin is a type of antibiotic that is sometimes used to treat UTIs, but it is not always effective against bladder infections. In this article, we will explore the use of Clindamycin for treating UTIs and give you some tips on how to keep your bladder healthy.\n\n## What is Clindamyam?\n\nClindamyam is a type of antibiotic that is used to treat some bacterial infections. It is available as tablets or capsules and can be prescribed by your doctor. Clindamyam works by killing the bacteria that cause infection. It is usually used to treat moderate to severe bacterial infections that cannot be treated with other antibiotics.\n\n## How does clindamyam work?\n\nClindamyam works by targeting and destroying the bacterial cell wall of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Clindamyam is one of the only drugs that can do this and is therefore effective against many types of UTIs.\n\n## The Benefits of Clindamyam\n\nClindamyam is a powerful antibiotic that is effective in treating a wide range of infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs). When taken as prescribed, Clindamyam can help to clear up UTIs and relieve the associated symptoms, such as pain, burning, and urgency.\n\nClindamyam works by stopping the growth of bacteria in the urinary tract.

However, the antihistamine Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) is useful for treating clogged nasal passages. Good question !\n\nDoes Zyrtec and benadryl work?\n\nI've heard that Benadryl has a high-affinity for GABA which would make it effective against tachycardia and I've heard that Zyrtec has a high-affinity for P2X and I've read a patent where Zyrtec has a high-affinity for 5HT1D and would thus produce an anxiolytic effect.", "If you use these both together, you're less likely to have side effects.

Contact your physician if any of these occur.\n\nIs Zyrtec the same as cetirizine?\n\nThe chemical names can differ, whereas the name brands do not. Claritin is marketed with the chemical names loratadine or desloratadine.

If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor or local poison control center immediately.\n\nWhat should I do if I have an allergic reaction to my nausea prescription?", "Well, yes, you should not take combination medications. It\u2019s the wrong way to treat motion sickness.\n\nDr. Rowen has told patients and co-workers of the dangers of combination medications ever since he was a young child.  The point, he likes to say, is to peel off the layers of your problems one at a time and determine which difficulty is the real difficulty.  That then leads you to the cause that needs treatment.  The goal \u2014 and key to health \u2014 is to simply remove the cause.\n\nMotion sickness is unpleasant, but it isn\u2019t usually a cause for concern. It\u2019s not harmful, just irritating and uncomfortable. But it is a good example of treating with cause-and-effect rather than symptom-to-sympton.\n\nSometimes it comes simply from thinking when there\u2019s nothing to think about.\n\nRemember going on rollercoasters and getting sick?  It was that thinking.  Not the rollercoaster!  Did anyone get sick on August 21, 2017, when everyone was outside watching the eclipse?  We didn\u2019t, right?  Why?  Because we had no time to get in our minds and think about sickness.\n\nYou see, the motion told the body to sit back HARD.  The thinking told the stomach to want real relief from what was happening in a way.  The motion was fine.  The body was telling your stomach how to handle a ride.  According to the Mayo clinic \u201ctell-it-no-stilliness\u201d by the thinking is what created the condition of thinking about sickness instead of relaxing.  The body was protecting us from the heavy G-force \u2014 especially in rollercoaster cars with hard edges \u2014 simply because we are alive and want to live.  (If we\u2019re caught up in our stomachs, it\u2019s our cheeks that take the extreme velocity.  Remember, foreheads don\u2019t.\n\nOr the simple stated reality is that we have no control over what happens during a rollercoaster ride and so we need to give causal credit to the cause.\n\nIn much the same way, during a car journey, when you get relaxed you feel good because the roads are smooth and the seat isn\u2019t comfortable.\n\nSo, if  that is the case, what about drugs to diminish", "Yes, you can take a nausea companion medication with Dramamine in some circumstances.\n\nFor example, if Dramamine alone isn\u2019t working, Dramamine and meclizine (Antivert) can be combined to help prevent nausea.\n\nWhether it\u2019s appropriate to take antinausea medications together can depend on the dose of each medication. This is because medications can interact.\n\n## Medications to prevent nausea\n\nMedications are available to help treat nausea and vomiting:\n\n- over-the-counter (OTC)\n- added to a prescription\n\nThis section takes a look at the two list medications that a person may be prescribed: meclizine or scopolamine. We\u2019ve also included a list of medications that you can take OTC to help with nausea.\n\n### Meclizine\n\nMeclizine is a medication that\u2019s commonly used to help prevent nausea. It also goes by the brand name Centin. Meclizine is generally considered safe, though it may have side effects:\n\nIf you\u2019re considering taking meclizine, speak with your healthcare provider first before doing so. If your nausea is due to pregnancy, speak to your doctor or midwife about taking meclizine.\n\nThe suggests that meclizine should only be used in pregnancy during the second and possibly third trimesters.\n\nMeclizine comes in oral tablets and syrups that you can take before exposure to a trigger such as:\n\nIn contrast, scopolamine is used mainly as motion sickness prevention.\n\n### Scopolamine\n\nScopolamine is the generic name of the medications Transderm Scop and Teginon. Scopolamine can be used as a prescription medication.\n\nScopolamine can enter body tissues by traveling through a patch, which is then placed behind your ear. Once your body absorbs the patch\u2019s contents, scopolamine begins to work to prevent nausea.\n\nSuccess rates among people who took scopolamine depended on the study and the way scopolamine was given:\n\n- In one study, 88.8% of people who took scopolamine patches didn\u2019t experience motion sickness.\n- In another study, 62.5% of people who", "Hydroxyzine hydrochloride and dimenhydrinate interact with the following drugs: Methadone Blood levels of me\n\n## Can a nausea prescription be taken at the same time as Dramamine?\n\nHydroxyzine hydrochloride and dimenhydrinate interact with the following drugs:\n\n- Methadone\n- Orphenadrine\n- Promethazine\n- Trazodone\n- Medications for depression (antidepressants)\n- Certain anti-arrhythmic drugs\n- Medications for glaucoma (drugs that widen your pupil)\n- Medications for anxiety (benzodiazepines)\n- Certain medic\n\n## Does hydroxyzine help with allergies?\n\nHydroxyzine belongs to a group of medicines known as antihistamines, and it works by stopping the effects of histamine in the body.

This can be helpful if you need to reduce symptoms of mild anxiety quickly. Because Benadryl causes many people to feel drowsy, it can also help aid in sleep.\n\n## Does water help with nausea?\n\nDrinking water or sucking ice chips can distract you from focusing on your stomach. The subsiding nausea will allow you to take in more water.

Consuming too many calories results in weight gain.\n\nNote of Warning: No matter where cholesterol comes from, it is still cholesterol. Fatty meats, meats, fried or saturated fats, plant-derived fats, baked goods and sweets, alcoholic beverages, and fish can all raise blood triglyceride levels (fats found in the blood that are higher after meals).\n\nIt contains valuable omega-3 fatty acids that assist all organ systems of our bodies and boost heart health, in addition to the aforementioned foods.\n\nSome individuals, such as diabetics, have always been thought to be unable to stop their craving for sugars and sweet foods, and that eating sugar harms them more. However, according to research, obesity and sugars are more common in children and adolescents.\n\nThe sugar or pellet intake that children now like, according to research, is raising their blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin.\n\nThis leads us to the following question: Where do you get sugar in order to appease your sweet taste?\n\nThere are a few sweet sugars that contain nutritious properties apart from high-calorie content.\n\n### Consume these organic or natural sugars:\n\n- Honesty\n- Agave\n- Maple syrup\n- Caramelized sugar\n- A liquid produced from maple trees\n- Barley m", "1olicense degree 66infom\nIf you ask what the relationship between diabetes and sweets? ?\n? ?How should diabetics eat sweets!?\n?\uff0c?You can refer to this article to get a detailed answer.\n?\ntoday in this article,we will unveil the mystery of eating sweets by diabetics,?and uncover the mystery of the use of sweets for diabetics.\n?\nfirst of all,?if you still have questions about the relationship between sweets and diabetes,?you can continue to read.\n?\n1.will I go blind for eating too much sweets?(Are honeysuckle and sugar similar to raw potatoes and blood sugar?)\n?\nanswer:?basically yes,?honeysuckle and sugar are similar to raw potatoes and blood sugar.\n?\nBecause diabetics eat sweets too much that have caused long term hyperglycemia,?active damage to the kidneys,?eyes,?nerves,?and other organs,?the symptoms of diabetics tend to be prone to glomerulus lesions,?retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy,?so they are easy to go blind for that,?because their eyes accord with the physiological characteristics of this disease.\n?\nthe reason is that?there is a kind of protein in low molecular peptide which is useful to stabilize vision,?but can be rapidly decomposed and cleared under hyperglycemia to provide energy for metabolic safety, used as nutritional energy,?when the blood sugar is too high,?this protein can not be produced,?which leads to use of more nutritional energy to metabolize and clear each other,?causing hunger and excessive protein activity,?and excessive carbohydrate utilization,?because the body lacks the support effect of sufficient protein to stabilize vision.\n?\nthus we have emphasis on the theory between diabetics and eating sweets.\n?\n2.

Fruit and fruit juice\nFruit is a good source of energy, vitamins and minerals that can prevent various diseases.\nHoney can not only be added to the diet without sugar, but also alleviate some of the symptoms of diabetes.\n\n2. Sugar-free food\nClear candy and sugar-free cake and pastry are great for diabetes, but because they are much sweeter than regular foods, you need to drink a lot of water, or your blood sugar will rise even higher.\n\n3. Dairy products\nDairy products provide natural calcium. Without controlling the amount of diet, it will not be detrimental to diabetes patients.

Surely they can eat a sweet, but don\u2019t panic. Because this statement doesn\u2019t mean they can eat too much sugar.\n?\nAs explained in between lines, they still have to keep their blood sugar level in range only.\n?\nThey can eat a sweet if they have eaten a proper meal before sweet.

Diabetics can also eat dairy products such as milk or cheese. It is still debatable, whether or not to eat boiled eggs by the diabetics.\n?\nA long time ago, it was stated that diabetics shouldn\u2019t eat fresh fruits. However nowadays health organizations have shown that diabetics are able to eat some fruits as long as they don\u2019t have a high glycemic index. They can also eat nuts within their low portion.\n?\nYou can see the white rice as the symbol of the bad food. That is so, when we eat a lot of white rice at the same time as eating other meals.\n?\nIt is because we need all of our diet to contribute to our health. Of course we will not advocate asian food because it is the same with many countries to consume.\n\n2. Glucose Testing\n\nThe second important point has relation to the blood glucose that needs to be checked after they eat. They need to measure their blood glucose in a daily basis.\n?\nIt is to ensure the blood glucose level is within the range to keep their overall health.\n\n3.

My neck has been stiff, and there is thick fluid discharge from my nostrils.\n\nI have had four \u201cglands\u201d on the left side of my neck that appear to be a node protrusion \u2013 it hurts to touch them and they are very swollen and hard, compared to the right side of my neck. I believe these are caused by sinus infections, as well.\n\nSymptoms of sinus infections generally include stuffy or runny nose, pressure in the nose, head congestion, fever, chills, ear pain, and other symptoms.\n\n## Sinus Infection Causes Neck Vein Distention\n\nHaving of frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, or other sinusitis for long-term can cause delayed, partly-hidden and neglected discomforts including neck vein distention with filling or swelling of veins on the back of neck, and even face. It is important in a more clear terminology is to know exactly what neck veins are. Certain veins of the inferior vena cava, namely greater and smaller vertebral or subclavian veins collect venous blood from virtually all dorsal parts of the human body. Functioning of these veins carries great concern especially in the upper parts of human body which is made possible by existence of one-way valves that prevent the latter from the gravity or gravity-caused retropulsion. Valves of vertebral veins are usually between the first-second through fourth to fifth cervical vertebrae as well as between the seventh and ninth vertebrae. Weaknesses or impairments in these constrictions may cause retrogens and subsequent signs or symptoms especially during periods of long-term sinus infections.\n\nThese venous poolings that are partly responsible for supplements of blood and stressors that constitute neck vein distention have been reported in the past in case analyses, and probably a very unconventional confirmation or suggesting factor in some the diseases or clinical syndromes especially during sinusitis with signs like headaches that extend towards the back of head, stiff neck, and decrease of ability to sometimes turn the head.First-mentioned are more possible", "How about sinus issues alone causing these symptoms, especially when I take a low dose of hydrocodone w/APAP? I am 37 years old and deal with these issues weekly. If I get a sinus infection I also get migraine pain on the right side of my head and it sometimes causes a tight headache. I also get neck vein bulge slightly and neck pain by the occipital nerve. These symptoms can last weeks at a time and don't go away. I miss work quite often due to being lethargic and my allergy like symptoms. I just quit smoking and have hay fever all year round. I will only deal with R1 and pain on the right side of my head as well as mild coughing when I am sick. The sinus pain and mouth breathing issues are the most annoying and the ones that are really causing all this. The sinus pain causes the nose to run which then causes the mouth breathing and the neck pain symptoms. These symptoms make it difficult to work because I want to sleep lying down with the heating pad on my neck and face. I get headaches and mouth breathing issues when I am stuffy too, only it is a LOT worse than when I am not stuffy. I cannot sit upright for more than 30 minutes without opening wide and breathing through my mouth. I also wake up every morning with swelling puffy eyes, when I am not sick. I know something is wrong, but no one can seem to help me. My GP sent me to ENT and they believe it is allergies but told me they found sinus polyps and no infection. They told me to go to an allergist to start allergy shots. No mention of additional help for mouth breathing or nasal swelling, only to go to an allergist. I noticed that my neck bulging and neck pain also reduces when I take a LOT of Mucinex D but this hinders my sleep. I can tell because I wake up extra puffy with little swelling. Anybody have anything similar or any knowledge of this stuff? I am paying thousands a year out of my own pocket for these issues. I only got these problems a year ago so hereditarily it cannot be.", "A lot of people with neck and jaw injuries have probably experienced distention of veins in the neck. This may contribute to foggy head, general aches and pains, grumpiness, angry moods, brain fog, fatigue, headache, and jaw pain as well as approach, migraine and different types of headaches.\n\nNerve pressure in the cervical spine (neck) can cause distention of the veins in the neck as is the case with sinus infections. Cancer and benign tumors can also press on the nerves that control the veins. This is called jugular vein distention. People who have injured their jaw with adhesion inside should try to eliminate the injury inside so the veins can drain the swelling back to the heart as they usually did..\n\nOnce they are dilated to the point where they can\u2019t collapse properly, blood just pumps and pumps harder as it accumulates in the venous sinuses and in dilated neck veins. Pressure on veins for weeks or months can cause inflammation and pain inside the neck and can inflame the nerves that exit the skull through a unique bone\u2014it is called the jugular foramen.\n\n## Jaw Relaxation Foggy Head & Neck Pain\n\nSinus infections or even misaligned or subluxated teeth can have an effect on some people and cause their neck and jugular veins to swell. The sinuses are intimately related and associated with all this.\n\nSubluxations in the craniecervical junction (CCJ) can cause blood pooling in veins\n\nThere are nerves that exit the skull in a direct field to the Jugular vein In an area of the neck called the jugular foramen, just forward of the carotid artery The symptom of a can be different for every person. In some people, it is a constant throbbing The sensation may be centered at the base of the neck near the back, left or right, or where the neck meets the jawline. Other people focus on jaw and tooth pain combined with grit and ear pain and burning. Distention of the neck veins causes increased pressure in the dura mater (inner membrane of the skull).That negatively affects balance and coordination. Neck distention can affect the vagus nerve in the neck.\n\nInflammatory assault", "Was wondering why I\u2019ve always had extra large neck veins at the base of my neck that are a little swollen.

Please help. A.\nPractice managing stress. Healthy coping mechanisms will reduce the stress that can lead to headaches in the first place, as well as help relieve headache pain. Get enough sleep,\u2014aim for 7 to 9 hours most nights. Exercise, eat healthfully, and practice relaxation techniques. Use meditation, yoga, and other mind-body techniques to relax physical muscles, calm the nervous system, improve circulation, and lift mood.\n~~The cervical spine is also surrounded by a thick, tangled web of nerves. In general, those nerves are amazingly difficult to irritate, much harder than people think, but it\u2019s not impossible. Many sharp and shooting neck pains are probably caused by minor neuropathy (pain from nerve irritation) that will ease gradually over several days or a few weeks at the worst, like a bruise healing. It\u2019s unpleasant, but not actually scary, like banging your funny bone (ulnar nerve): that thing can really take a licking and keep on ticking. So can the nerves in your neck.~~\n`Other Disease Processes: Although neck pain is commonly caused by strain, prolonged pain and/or neurologic deficit may be an indication of something more serious. These symptoms should not be ignored. Spinal infection, spinal cord compression, tumor, fracture, and other disorders can occur. If head injury has been sustained, more than likely the neck has been affected too. It is wise to seek medical attention promptly.`\n\n```\nLight shortly after birth with partial nudity, a quiet and dim beginning that gives way to colored lights, upbeat music, objects and intensely bright lights with a largest light source an inch away from the face\u2014these are some of the unexpected habits that make childhood vision problems more likely.

Here are some symptoms and conditions related to insomnia:\n\n- Can't fall asleep or stay asleep\n- Daytime fatigue or sleepiness\n- Awaking too early in the morning\n- Memory problems\n- Lack of concentration\n- Irritability or mood swings\n- Attention deficit\n- Feeling depressed and anxious\n- Gastrointestinal or other physical problems\n- Tension headache\n- Feeling tired upon waking\n\n## Where Do I Start?\n\nDeep Sleep Therapy was specifically designed to be used with ear buds, like those that come with sunglasses...or , whatever fits your application.\n\n### For Portability we offer Earbuds\n\nSimple 3 Band Equalizer - Helps to store earbuds for listening comfortably in your ears anywhere you wish.", "That would be a great help!.\n\nI want to \u201creset my brain\u201d\n\nI have that feeling like I can\u2019t sleep, its been weeks. And I need to figure out the root cause before I make a long-term lifestyle adjustment. Im going to a different country soon and don\u2019t want to bring along my ROVIB with me since Im concerned it\u2019ll get stolen.\n\nI feel like my brain is in a perpetual stress response and just need a way to turn it off for a few days.\n\nThe Reset pack was good and helped but now its gone. Are there alternatives?", "Such as a tea?\n\nI struggled with insomnia for the longest time, and I could never sleep because of how bad I felt and my negative thoughts spiral; here is a complete sedating tea.

The combination of sedating herbs works wonders to help you relax and calm down, so Anya and Wise Sleep Tea is what you need.\n\nRemember; supplements are not meant for longer dates.

Also, insomnia can lower your body\u2019s resistance to disease, which can have significant long-term adverse effects.\n\nIf insomnia is a temporary condition, it may be a symptom of a stressful lifestyle or a sign of another issue such as chronic pain, anxiety disorders, or depression.\n\nIf insomnia is disorderly and lasts for a few nights, it could be unpleasant but not serious. Most sleepless nights can be relieved through simple things, such as going to bed at an early hour or taking pressure off your mind by meditation.\n\nHowever, if insomnia becomes a regular thing every night, it is time for you to seek out an effective treatment immediately.\n\n### Insomnia treatment\n\nThe first thing you need to do is spot the cause of your insomnia\u2013 Will it be something physiological, mental, or even environmental?\n\nFor example: Physical problems such as chronic pain, weight and body fitness, specific medical condition such as respiratory problem, digestive and kidney disease.\n\nSometimes, women across different ages go through the problem of menstrual cycle", "Oral solutions are a great tool that can help to alleviate insomnia symptoms while you work on a long term treatment plan. For those that struggle with insomnia, many of them often suffer from mood swings, and may be experiencing more stressful feelings throughout the day as well as during the night before falling asleep. So it\u2019s important to realize that any and all oral solutions available to help with insomnia is often only half of what it takes to alleviate the problem. That\u2019s why drugs that treat this disorder should always include a short term plan as well as a long term strategy.\n\nBenefits of Sleep Solutions\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever struggled with insomnia, you probably already know how badly it can mess up your entire life. Long periods of uninterrupted sleep allow you to rest your body, thinking clearly, and enables your brain to recharge so that it can concentrate more effectively the next day. The need for solid sleep is so stress on the body that the short term effects of insomnia could result in forgetfulness, confusions, sluggishness, and general mood issues. The prescription medications available now can help a person begin to address the issues related to short term, but if you take a look at what a few years could do, they are he worst for the long term solution.\n\nThe Best Solutions for Insomnia\n\nIt can be incredibly difficult to find the best solution to help with insomnia short term. People can often show symptoms that are linked to the disorder but also presents other indicators that could be things like hormonal imbalances and/or other physical conditions that influence the symptoms of insomnia. As with any other kind of disorder, if you have tried every solution available for the short term problem, if continues to do so, and those that persist, you should always consult your doctor for guidance and a long term treatment plan.\n\nOral solutions may be able to help you deal with any issue that your insomnia may bring, but in order to achieve the best solution for insomnia, you need to be fully aware of what the root problem is and avoid that problem in the future so that there is a very limited chance that insomnia will ever come back again."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.2857, "rouge1_r": 0.0907, "rouge1_f1": 0.1376, "rouge2_p": 0.036, "rouge2_r": 0.0114, "rouge2_f1": 0.0173, "rougel_p": 0.2232, "rougel_r": 0.0708, "rougel_f1": 0.1075, "bleurt": 0.4225, "bert_score_p": 0.7771, "bert_score_r": 0.7625, "bert_score_f1": 0.7698, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.2143, "rouge1_r": 0.1951, "rouge1_f1": 0.2043, "rouge2_p": 0.018, "rouge2_r": 0.0164, "rouge2_f1": 0.0172, "rougel_p": 0.125, "rougel_r": 0.1138, "rougel_f1": 0.1191, "bleurt": 0.3271, "bert_score_p": 0.816, "bert_score_r": 0.7827, "bert_score_f1": 0.799, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4821, "rouge1_r": 0.1818, "rouge1_f1": 0.2641, "rouge2_p": 0.0901, "rouge2_r": 0.0338, "rouge2_f1": 0.0491, "rougel_p": 0.2411, "rougel_r": 0.0909, "rougel_f1": 0.132, "bleurt": 0.3446, "bert_score_p": 0.8095, "bert_score_r": 0.8018, "bert_score_f1": 0.8057, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.2143, "rouge1_r": 0.2308, "rouge1_f1": 0.2222, "rouge2_p": 0.009, "rouge2_r": 0.0097, "rouge2_f1": 0.0093, "rougel_p": 0.125, "rougel_r": 0.1346, "rougel_f1": 0.1296, "bleurt": 0.2635, "bert_score_p": 0.8257, "bert_score_r": 0.7836, "bert_score_f1": 0.8041, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4375, "rouge1_r": 0.1392, "rouge1_f1": 0.2112, "rouge2_p": 0.0901, "rouge2_r": 0.0285, "rouge2_f1": 0.0433, "rougel_p": 0.2321, "rougel_r": 0.0739, "rougel_f1": 0.1121, "bleurt": 0.3, "bert_score_p": 0.811, "bert_score_r": 0.806, "bert_score_f1": 0.8085, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 75.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4821, "rouge1_r": 0.1403, "rouge1_f1": 0.2173, "rouge2_p": 0.0631, "rouge2_r": 0.0182, "rouge2_f1": 0.0283, "rougel_p": 0.2768, "rougel_r": 0.0805, "rougel_f1": 0.1247, "bleurt": 0.3398, "bert_score_p": 0.82, "bert_score_r": 0.8038, "bert_score_f1": 0.8118, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

Anxiety -mild, moderate, severe- all of it is crippling to a person because it impairs one's ability to function at her/his full potential. Not being able to focus at work or even when performing normal every day activities is a huge distraction and completely denies the mental, emotional and physical self of one's vibrant essence. First, please catch your breath for a second or two. You've come to the right place. I happen to know a lot about anxiety.\n\nKeep in mind that dealing with the first small thud of anxiety is much easier to tackle than a larger problem of the repeated-recurring fluctuating anxiety.\n\nHere's what I recommend: -remove any foods that might be causing your anxiety -there are several foods that calms you down to reverse several types of anxiety. For example, turmeric is excellent to keep you cool and in control. Also, write down several foods that worsen your anxious feelings.\n\nKeep in mind, you may have to experiment a bit to find what best works for you.\n\n-Drink peppermint tea -take Epsom salt baths and increase the amount of bubbles-increase magnesium in your body because magnesium can completely stop a panic attack. Muscle tension is often a cause of anxiety (magnesium is naturally rich in many foods and natural compounds.)\n\nAnxiety often gets worse when there is nutritional deficiency or imbalances in one's body chemistry. That doesn't mean you have to go out and take several different vitamins and/or supplements. There are supplements that can balance one's well-being fast.\n\nGet something like a melatonin capsule, 5HTP (ready to buy at most vitamin shops, amazon etc.) those two supplements can be an immense help to eliminating the jittery feeling you get when you are anxious. Instead of taking the melatonin later at bedtime before sleep, best to take it 30-45 min. before an anxiety attack. I believe melatonin is the most natural supplement one can take for female induced anxiety before bedtime.

They are lined with a mucosa, which usually produces mucus - the sticky stuff alike to glue, which you may get when blowing a very runny nose.\n\nMost sinusitis (known as acute sinusitis) is viral. This means they are caused by viruses that normally cause infections of the CMV - of the inflammatory mucous. During cold or flu, a viral infection may cause the nose to remain blocked even when cold symptoms are resolving. But the nasal mucosa (the lining) is simply inflamed, and not not really infected. Applying heat (steam, for example) may help a bit with the blockage, but does very little to improve a sinusitis.\n\nWhile some bacteria also form part of the \u2018normal\u2019 bacteria in our nose and sinuses (normally they cause no problems), viruses have better protection against antibiotics. Despite being not infected, you will still get prescribed an antibiotic for sinusitis. It is a safe bet when you have a high fever, especially if the mucus in your nose is actually discecoloured. After 4-7 days of antibiotics, sinusitis will clear up and you will be discharged from the clinic. This is all to the good, but a bit of an unneccesary hassle for both patient and clinician.\n\n### Antibiotics for sinusitis conditions that may actually be due to a bacterial infection.\n\nWe haven't created a category yet but we are getting ready!\n\n### \u00abPhilosophy in Medicine\u00bb is copyright Samir Nair, 2018.

Antibiotics, therefore, are only effective if there is bacterial sinusitis (1).\n\nWe may often talk about sinusitis when, in fact, it is just a flu that has become more complicated due to an accumulation of mucus in the sinuses (2).\n\nThen let us answer the question if it is possible to correctly identify bacterial sinusitis, that is, a sinusitis is caused by a bacterial infection (3-4).\n\nBacterial sinusitis develops secondarily to a common cold or an allergic rhinitis, that is, it is caused by the presence of bacteria in the sinuses. The symptoms of bacterial sinusitis are a nasal obstruction with difficulty breathing through the nose, pain in the teeth and above the eyes during chewing, headache, double vision, earache, rhinorrhea, and sometimes fever. (3-4)\n\nGiven all these symptoms, we can reason for an individual's self-medication, which is dangerous for the patient, unprofitable for the State, and dangerous for the pharmaceutical companies (5-6).\n\nDespite the serious disadvantages of antibiotics, antibiotic products are more profitable for pharmaceutical companies than safe nonantibiotic products, such as everything that is prescribed for vasoconstriction, decongestion, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, expectorating, anti-diarrheal, and dehydrating purposes.\n\nThe production of these latter is a loss-making business.\n\nThe situation leads to the question of why the big pharmaceutical companies are not interested in creating new safe nonantibiotic drugs. Let us examine this problem a little.\n\nWe shall now recall the marketing rules by which pharmaceutical companies operate:\n\n- pharmaceutical companies use paid and/or not paid marketing, which, as a rule, greatly exceeds the promotion of innovative medications and, as a rule, is primarily aimed at primary care physicians (about 80% of primary care physicians in Europe work for a pharmaceutical company) (7).\n- Consultation of a specialist when consulting", "I\u2019d like to buy it at an official pharmacy Third shift viagra to buy Welcome to Twitter And of course we got the Champions Medal Fund Raised The difficulty for Moyes coming next month is how to keep the same work ethic and momentum at the start of next season while going back to the club\u2019s old ways in terms of playing extremely attractive attacking football?\" Possibly the odd one out here is the iPod touch, which has the most to lose by updating to a new iOS, but also has the oldest design hardware wise, even if the iPhone 5c has tried hard to mimic this design. monsoon horn\n\nAnd for me personally, it is I\u2019ve had a shave since then so i\u2019m smooth shaven and while it\u2019s a little better I still can\u2019t fit them This means that the maximum dream game will cost less than 15k for both of you, and will probably have more points than in the original dream\n\nHow long are you planning to stay here? world fish viagra reviews and attraction.

Randomised clinical trials demonstrated that ethically, it seems no more appropriate to prescribe an antibiotic agent than to prescribe a placebo, as antibiotic does not have effective results on the majority of patients suffering from the common cold than placebo. Nevertheless, itis often prescribed by relief-minded physicians in response of complaints.\n\nAlthough antibiotics were developed to treat bacterial infections, they are being widely used to treat sinusitis that\u2019s caused by viruses or that is bacterial in origin, which should not be an indication for their use. Despite your past experience in successfully achieving results when using antibiotic therapy for sinusitis, there\u2019s growing evidence suggesting antibiotics don't work for treating sinusitis caused by viruses.\n\nLet me make it clear, if you take antibiotic when your infection is viral, it doesn\u2019t make your viral infection better. Taking those antibiotics at that moment of viral infection, not only that they don\u2019t work, but antibiotics can also kill the beneficial bacteria that were in your nose and throat originally and that was protecting you from the viruses. Once killed, those bacteria are not replaced. And consequently, you are much more likely to get a secondary bacterial infection, which makes sense but is scary.\nRecent studies suggest that even bacterial viruses, if they are a recent infection, the antibiotics are not going to be of help. This is a really big deal. Antibiotic use can give you a maximal response for 14-21 days. The acute sinusitis will be better because you are treating it, like having symptoms improved by that antibiotic treatment.\nBut those antibiotics canagive a temporary control on those symptoms. The problem was that the antibiotic was not of good benefit long term. If you want to take antibiotic for maximal response of 21 days, it doesn't help.

In fact, it is estimated that about 10 percent of people with diabetes are diagnosed with the condition after experiencing a sudden onset of symptoms.\n\nThe most common symptoms of diabetes are increased thirst, increased urination, and increased hunger.

Therefore, if you have any doubt, ask your doctor.\n\n## Symptoms of diabetes: what they depend on?\n\nFactors that can affect the symptoms of diabetes will learn more about them in the next lines.Symptoms of diabetes: frontiers in diabetescoma (a moderate to severe accumulation of glucose) and peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage). Early changes in related signs coincide with symptoms of deblitus and diabetics coma occur with digestive issues or digestive tract failure. Symptom checkness before the diseaseyam-consumed diets and frequent monounsaturated acids that prevent or treats deblitus and diabetics coma help in prevention and to restore.\n\nSome diabetes symptoms in patients:for most new postsomething rarely occur left out the first pre- diabetes symptoms. Sinclair, a real qlack name, is derived from a diet made to accept the type of diabetes diagnosed but it is believed by some, even scientists, that he was very successful in reducing the risk of getting the disease.\n\nIf you have these typical symptoms of diabetes, and along with excess hunger, have fatigue, the usual possibile first signs are isolation from other diabetics, frequent inability to swallow, temporary: diabetics coma. Consult a doctor: there are three easy and actual ways to determine the existence of the diabetes: they are: family history, lifestyle, typeo and most diabetics are diagnosed, and the 7th one is that you have a problem among the following:\n\nKids constipation", "Detect these clues \u2014 known sign of Type-2 diabetes\n\nDiabetes is no more a life-threatening condition as it was a few years ago, as understanding  the condition and the type of treatment have considerably grown assigned with the right treatment, death can be reduced. The symptoms of diabetes may be mild or severe and a range present in different intensity or in different combinations. Many people with diabetes remain unaware of the condition until they suffer severe medical complications caused by untreated high blood glucose.\n\n###### Type 2 Diabetes\n\nType 1 usually affects people of a younger age group. It\u2019s a genetic disorder that develops at the age of 40 \u2013 60 years.\n\nAnd 90% of people\u2019s diabetes is type-2. The reason for the increased risk is about 90%. Diabetes is not contracted from anyone else, food, water or air. But, if the family has a diabetic patient, then the risk of diabetes is a bit high than the others.\n\nFor overweight people, the risk of diabetes is higher.\n\nFor overweight people, the risk of occurrence or increase is high which usually causes type-2 diabetes.\n\nTherefore, you should always remain alert to any of these..\n\n##### \u2013 Starvation feeling\n\nIn the beginning, only fatigue is apparent while hunger does not go away. The general one is that doing more work because of fatigue keeps you away from eating.  For this reason, blood sugar starvation occurs quickly, which leads to frequent urination.\n\n##### \u2013 High blood sugar\n\nAfter one or two days of illness becomes standard, other symptoms of diabetes show up, such as high blood sugar.\n\nInitially, it is usually seen that urinating increases and frequency rather than standard.\n\nBeginning to urinate several times at night increases.  This happens because blood sugar causes excess hunger.  Urine keeps the kidneys busy.  As a result, blood sugar gets higher.\n\nOn the other hand, there is not enough water in the body.  This causes confusion, restless, frequent urination.\n\nIn addition, due to high blood sugar, intestinal movement also slows down. This combination reduces the weight. Because weight smoothest throughout the body lowers.  Ultimately, weight loss begins.\n\n####", "Diabetes type 2 can be caused by rapidly rising body weight. However, the children quickly can develop type 1 diabetes. A study found an explanation for this fact: the genes of the baby with overweight parents can with the onset of diabetes. This is the conclusion of researchers at Rockefeller University research. The report of the study was released in advance on the website Science Express published.\n\nAt least in the United States, the Type 2 diabetes, which make up 90 percent of the diabetes occurring in adults, increases rapidly. \"A long accumulation of fat pancreas causes insulin production to fail because the cells of the affected organs are less and less sensitive to insulin,\" explains study leader researcher Rory you C and co author of the study. However asked in the study show that young children, especially those with family background of diabetes, the fast Version is often the faster the condition occurs. In the oldest children, there was a 1,000-fold increased risk. Without obesity, however, one of the rare cases of children's type 1 diabetes occurred. \"These Patterns suggest that fat to fast-track type 1 diabetes,\" the researchers write in the study.\n\nWeight mum as the disease agent\n\nThe researchers wanted to find out which aspects of the disease make. Clinical studies and backed diets have shown so far only little success. \"Evidence to recommend any treatment as a very mindful diet is insufficient\", reports the AD Grace D. Winick of the university hospital Heidelberg. \"An intensive search for changes in scientific studies, we found evidence that certain diets can prevent or delay the onset in Type 1 diabetes,\" emphasizes the Specialist for internal medicine in terms of wound care Federal Association. The doctors Winick reported about the experiences of the medical team at the Heidelberg Microness L.L.C family Robinson. The daughter of the well-known family Stiller developed in 2013 Type 1 diabetes. She left an intensive stomach-colon detox with Enema 10 days to a healthy digestive tract and at the request, a special diet. Although the experts advocated, mostly by sports and healthy diet, the healing process was successful. The diagnosis has been eradicated.\n\nIn the current study, diseases of the metabolism played a key role: the body's pancre", "Diabetes diminishes early the signs and symptoms can be hidden or the disease develops symptoms in a very short period of time.

Measurement of the levels of blood sugar two hours after a meal).\n\nTo check if a person is suffering from diabetes he also makes the tests antiglukozouros and lipidophilic (called total cholesterol and blood). It is also important to identify if there is damage to large blood vessels and kidneys (check for retinopathy retinal in the back of the eye, for example), neuropathy (nerve damage) and affect the circulation of the extremities (foot tenderness and cooling considered signs that the nerves are being damaged).\n\nType 1 diabetes\n\nThere is also the possibility, once identified diabetes by blood test, the person be sent to hospital some additional tests as to determine what is called type. Here are these types:\n\nType 1 diabetes\nThis type of diabetes affects children and young adults. People with type 1 diabetes (about 1% of all persons with diabetes), unless they receive daily insulin your body will not be. Since diabetes seems to be caused by damage to the cells that secrete insulin, they believe this damage is somehow under the action of his own body. No one know what causes type 1 diabetes if these a group of genes that determine the probability that a person will develop a disease or not. To see if the parents have diabetes is dangerous to tell us anything about whether a child is the danger of developing diabetes. It is obvious, though, that the members of such families nonstop most do it.\n\nType 2 diabetes\nScreening helps you find blamagouros eligible for impeaching requested early treatment, monitoring their tendency to experience complications associated with a chronic, degenerative disease term.

The reason for this is that I have recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. This was a huge shock because for as long as I can remember, I have never been diagnosed as having any disorders on health issues.\n\nHowever, even though it was a shock, it turned out that after a few tests I had found out that I was also having Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) which is a disease that combines the different hormones to form complicate hormonal problems in the body. The Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome itself can lead to a few different health issues, but the two major consequences for someone with the symptoms are both fertility problems and/or obesity.\n\nIt was after the diagnosis of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome that I realized I needed a way to deal with my eating habits, and not in a way where I was obsessing over the food I ate. In my mind, I knew that I needed to eat healthy for more than my blood sugar, but to also be aware of my body when I was eating.\n\nMy doctor recommended that I find a process where I could stay active throughout the day and not just oscillating between different meals.

Esophagitis is a condition that can cause inflammation and irritation of the esophagus, which is the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including muscle stiffness in the neck when swallowing.\n\nIt's possible that the muscle stiffness you're experiencing is related to the esophagitis. When the esophagus is inflamed, it can cause the muscles in the esophagus to become stiff and tight, making it difficult to swallow. This can also lead to pain in the neck and shoulders, as the muscles in these areas are also affected by the inflammation.\n\nIf you're experiencing these symptoms, it's important to talk to your doctor. They can help you determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan to help manage them. This may include medications, lifestyle changes, or other treatments.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyed. Depression can have a significant impact on a person\u2019s life, affecting their ability to work, socialize, and enjoy life.\n\nOne of the most common symptoms of depression is memory loss. Memory loss can be a frustrating and confusing experience, especially when it occurs in the context of depression. In this article, we will explore the relationship between depression and memory loss, and discuss some of the potential causes and treatments for this condition.\n\n## What is Memory Loss?\n\nMemory loss, also known as amnesia, is the inability to recall information or events that were previously known. It can affect both short-term and long-term memory, and can range from mild forgetfulness to severe memory impairment. Memory loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, stress, and certain medical conditions.\n\n## How is Memory Loss Related to Depression?\n\nDepression and memory loss are closely related. Depression can cause memory loss by affecting the brain\u2019s ability to process and store information. Depression can also cause changes in the brain\u2019s structure and function, which can lead to memory loss.\n\nOne of the most common symptoms of depression is forgetfulness. People with depression may have difficulty remembering things that happened in the past, or may forget important information that they need to remember. This can be frustrating and confusing, and can have a significant impact on a person\u2019s ability to function in their daily life.\n\n## What Causes Memory Loss in Depression?\n\nThere are several potential causes of memory loss in depression. One of the most common causes is stress. Stress can cause changes in the brain\u2019s structure and function, which can lead to memory loss. Depression can also cause changes in the brain\u2019s chemistry, which can affect memory.\n\nAnother potential cause of memory loss in depression is the use of certain medications. Some medications used to treat depression can cause memory loss as a side effect. It is important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have about the medications you are taking.\n\n## How is Memory Loss Diagnosed?\n\nMemory loss can be diagnosed through a variety of tests and evaluations. Your doctor may perform a physical examination and ask you questions about your symptoms and", "Some people may be disappointed to hear the answer to this question in yes, others may find it strange since both memory and depression are interrelated with the brain.\n\nAccording to the American Psycho-analyst Association, the signs of chronic depression and emotional complaints are linked to mental ability or problems. A study done at the University of Toronto shows cognitive issues can result in a chronic depression.\n\n### Different Forms Of Depression\n\nIn ordinary life, there are different forms of depression and we will see a doctor if we suffer from these signs: sadness lasting more than 2 weeks, sleep changes, irritation, anxiety, appetite changes, losing interest in daily activities, loss of hope, insecurity, panic attacks, negative thoughts, experiancedown and in again mood swings and etc\u2026\n\nDepression may cause memory problemsfound in both aging and young people. Memory loss in geriatrics is due to Alzheimer, according to Psychiatry Department at Yale University, elevating hormone prolactin is a form of Alzheimer in young people. Prolactin elevates brain chemical dopamine in the major midbrain is thought to trigger memory loss. Drug addiction also may cause the lack of memory.\n\nLocal brain lesion or injury on the cortex stimulation may decrease memory deficits. It is a main cause of memory loss during an emotional illness.Unlike the memory loss for normal people, depression may extract unwanted or desired information from the brain. War veterans who suffered from depression are found to have more memory loss than general population.\n\nMajor depressive disorder may cause spatial memory problems (found in the sense of direction and grasping location of objects, places and people), and performance deficits in memory tests. Depression symptom is likely to be increased during active treatment for several weeks or months. Emotional illnesses (burnout) that last for more than 3 months may impair attention, psychomotor, memory, mental arithmetic, encoding and retrieval of new word list. Major depression decreases about 20 percent of memory deficit in healthy people and about 25-40 percent of short memory-spatial short-term memory, mood and attention problem. On the other hand, decreasing working memory and cognitive impairment is a major component of the depressed mood. Memory in depression is relatively efficient, at least compared to certain other illness, such as schiz", "The story of my memory loss. What I\u2019ve learnt from the experience. Why I think it\u2019s hard for many to admit it and talk about. How to prevent it.\n\nThe story\n\nSince the age of 19 I have been going through periods of depression. Now I am young and at the age of 22 depression has made me forget my identity of who I am. I can\u2019t recognise myself in the mirror. It gives me the worst feeling as deep inside I know that I\u2019ve already forgotten things to have happened and it has a profound impact on my self esteem and resilience. I have been feeling anxious most of the times about loosing patterns or memory in various times and it leads to a big cry and punishment to myself .\n\nWhy there is link between depression and memory loss?\n\nWe have to understand majorly that we can not give a definition of depression and ensure that it effects all of us. It is one of the worst words I can think it . So maybe it helps when we simplify grave meanings into valuable learning. Depression gives us a way to look at feelings of isolation, a sense of inadequacy and having lack of identity.\n\nWhen we look into it why depression can result with memory loss it can be the fact that the brain becomes inactive due to long-term unemployment or inactivity from stress. This causes small tear and wasting away of brain cells and eventually creates memory loss.\n\n It maybe be the Metabolism of depression slows down and when it does , your brain holds on to the glucose that it needs. This therefore means that it harder glucose gets into parts of the brain that need it. For those with depression this mainly poses to be the areas in the brain that power your ability to make new cells. This is again results in depression becoming greater as you have the possibility not to remember things and hence have a greater memory loss.\n\nThe adrenaline PUMP with depression  results in adrenaline that is called \u201ccortisol\u201d to be pumped into your bloodstream. Too much of cortisol is toxic to brain cells.The highest concentration of tragic brain cells, by the way, are stored away in tiny regions of the brain that play an essential role in regulating mood and memory. This is why chilling out more often could go a long way to protect your long-term memory and", "And this research, which was conducted on old people, unbelievably says yes.\n\nOlder depressed patients have more memory loss. And memory loss works behind old people\u2019s depression. The result of this study is shocking.\n\nThere are three possibilities of getting depression. Whether family or genetics history, traumas, social losses during childhood, and it is true that until now anxiety and stress overwhelmed the nursing homes.\n\nThe study works in Sweden and especially reveals a strong link between depression and old age.\n\nIn this study 933 people are participating in the study, which has been suffering from low depression. The study lasted 2 years, a year in the first round of testing and then testing during two years, and another year of follow-up.\n\nAfter this check it was found that there is an increase in the symptoms of depression only three years later. The researchers think that depression is mental disorder. The result showed that depression is a very powerful mental disorder.\n\nIn this study also found co-operation with symptoms of depression in older people with symptoms memory loss. Depression or memory loss, the elderly do not need to answer. First of all the oldest people need to immediately seek medical help.\n\nThe researchers of the study say,\n\n> The results are not at all surprising, but even the study was full of results before showing the effect of depression on Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Yes, the results of the study will mostly focus on the good things. But the findings are also very pleasing. Those who get rid of their depression remain unbearable.\n\n# Beware! Headache can cause death without knowing anything about it\n\nMost people know a headache or its complaint but they have no idea that a headache can cause death in people.\n\nA headache can be due to various reasons such as stress, memory failure, brain fatigue, lack of food, and it seems that old people have more complaints than young people.\n\nAccording to a scientific study, complaints coming out of headache can cause death without your knowledge, experts say.\n\nA side-by-side headache or headache can be a sign of a problem with your health. It is because A headache may accompany several dangerous health conditions that are not known by most people.\n\nHeadache is a health problem that people face at present most of the time and they", "Research studies show that there may be a relation between depression and memory loss. About sixty to eighty percent of the adults will show symptoms of a mental disorder at some point in their life: among these the most common are depression and anxiety. Individuals who experience major depression can have memory problems and in rare cases can lead to different types of dementia. As per the report of New York Times a study has revealed that older people experiencing normal age-related memory loss or complained about memory decline. Dr. Darrell C. Brumback, said a one-time award-winning physician for the health group from New York who is now Florida senior living community found that \u201cIf you have depression, there is a much higher chance that you\u2019ll have memory loss, even if you\u2019re not diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s or another type of dementia\u201d and added that older adults can have depression and the rate \u201canxiety disorders were higher among individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment in an independent sample and after statistical controlling for subjective memory concerns\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been shown that depression can be a symptom of a particular disease process, for example, the brain-damage caused by multiple sclerosis or an aneurysm; it can also be a co-morbid condition (such as genetic factors) that occur alongside other health problems like diabetes or heart disease,\u201d psychiatrist Dr. Alexander E. Grace of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City said.\n\nIt is possible that depression is one of the main factors affecting the memory, memory loss and cognitive decline abilities in older adults, although there have been speculations about how cruel to one another these conditions actually are. Many people find it challenging to discuss their symptoms of memory loss with doctors.\n\nAccording to the report of NYT, if a person feels isolated or alienated by their memory loss that can have negative consequences on their overall wellbeing, which may in turn lead to depression\u201d.\n\nThe good news is that if memory loss does occur, there are many strategies to cope with it.\n\n## Memory Support Programs:\n\nSome senior living communities provide the support and care as well as medicines which can be helpful in such condition for example: Brookdale.\n\nBrookdale is the leading Health and Retirement group of communities and senior living care providers in the United States. The care of the residents of Lincoln Park was always been the top priority a concern in many", "A recent research shows that depression could be linked to memory loss. Long-standing depression continues to hurt the hippocamus \u2013 a part of brain important for memory storage and then lead to lessening of chances that a depressed person will get better.\n\nA study was conducted at the University of Western Australia which shows that stripping part of brain (striatum \u2013 involved in pleasure), till the rats developed depression.

For instance, eating bananas can help. So, do bananas help with diarrhea? Yes.\n\nOf the many often ignored remedies, bananas are quite the ultimate home remedy to the problem of diarrhea. Here are some of the reasons why bananas are essential in helping with diarrhea:\n\n## Pectin\n\nPectin helps to reduce the severity of the diarrhea. Bananas are rich in pectin, which happens to be quite a soluble fibre. The fibre passes along with the intestines, providing ample water to ensure the patient does not experience dehydration. Anxiety and stress are also removed as the patient is sure that everything is under control. The body can now better digest and absorb the salt and nutrients, which are useful for recovery.\n\n## Carminative\n\nMany people who have had diarrhea consider bananas too bland. Ironically, this isn\u2019t a limitation. Carminative properties help to get rid of excess gases very fast from within the stomach. Breathing frequently eases a situation whereby the bowels move too frequently from the involuntary muscles to herald the passage of stools.\n\n## Magnesium\n\nBananas have plenty of magnesium that contributes to the electrolytes your body needs to maintain a certain level of hydration. When the excess water in the colon is sucked into the intestines, it combines with some of the stools to form fecal matter (which is the term used to refer to waste matter usually stools). As it happens, bananas can lower levels of fluidity that accompanies diarrhea. A combination of electrolytes, magnesium, and enzymes helps to stabilize the situation as the person seeks more stable health.\n\n## Starch\n\nMost people with diarrhea can attest to discomfort caused by quite a lot of air that cannot pass", "These play a specific role in the body. Without bananas, you cannot survive for a long period of time. So yes bananas can help a lot in diarrhea.\n\nThe question, \u201cdo bananas help with diarrhea?\u201d has a lot of answers. We know that bananas act as an antacid in the body. When a meal is hard to digest or you eat something and you feel diarrhea and nausea coming your way, banana can be the right anti-diarrheal for you. Besides all these things, bananas also give rise to cortisol hormone in the body as they contain Potassium Chloride compound.\n\nHaving diarrhea for a long time is abnormal. Fortunately, there are things that can reduce diarrhea. When having diarrhea, people are advised to have small amounts of food. This is good because it helps in preventing the development of diarrhea. Food ought to include proteins. This is because it boosts the health and wellness concerns. When you suffer from diarrhea, pass out a lot of water. Hence, it is better if you sip on fluids after you pass out water after having diarrhea.\n\nOf course, you cannot just go eat bananas when having diarrhea. Otherwise your diarrhea would get worse. Your diet has to complement what you go through the normal body per day. The inside of a banana helps to keep the electrolyte levels in check. Also, it is effective in addressing the symptoms of diarrhea.\n\nThe first thing you need to remember is not to drink bananas and make shakes using bananas. Also, it is advisable to only have permanently cooked bananas. This is a good result that is extremely nutritious. Therefore, when you have diarrhea symptoms, go for stewed banana for best results.\n\nAlso, you need to be aware that diarrhea is just one of the symptoms of the problem when you have stomach discomfort or an upset stomach. Apart from stomach pains and diarrhea, some symptoms include dehydration, stomach cramps, frequent bowel movement, bloating and indigestion.\n\nBananas as an antacid successfully combat acid reflux.

Farmers and workers would want a more practical choice for their work wear or casual needs. When you go low on quality, you give a low rating to your socks. When you lousy, your socks are always in the laundry.\n\nDo cheap socks even cause more problems than they promised? They keep your thick and clumsy feet from heat and diseases. But when you buy them at an affordable price, they are likely of poor material and quality. They also easily fray and damage to your intended effect. Just to list a few.\n\n## To Keep Your Toes From \u201cCutting Off Some Air Supply\u201d\n\nWorking on farms and construction sites are risky. We always want something safe and vital to our healthy accomplishment. Farmers and workers would want to prioritize safety while facing the threats in their clothes.\n\nWorn out cheap socks cannot keep away contaminants, microorganisms and particles of dirt. Most of them frequently wrinkle and sag inside the shoes causing toes \u201ccutting off some air supply\u201d. They became slouchy, stinky and sticky upon continuous use causing health problems. Sometimes they wear down or easily tear up when working with something \u201chairy\u201d.\n\nPoorly knotted and slouchy socks are always unable to keep dirt, moisture and particles from irritating your feet. And soon, you catch a serious fungal and germy infection.\n\nTo avoid these, you have to be more vigilant in choosing the socks for your personal use and utilization.\n\n## Cheap socks are unlikely to give a good fit\n\nWhen you buy on an affordable rate, they can easily wrinkle and sag. It will be harder for you because it may feel discomfort and squeeze in between those shorter toes of your seasonal shoes and boots.\n\nAlso, cheap socks may diffuse on the way up your leg. Cheap socks with a poor quality, inconsistent shape or missing materials will eventually turn out bad fit and fit gap in your shoe.\n\nThese chosen socks are unlike the well-fitted socks that comfortably snug your feet and give you the experience you surely expect and appreciate.\n\nBut, now you have to decide, do cheap socks cause problems for you?\n\n## Getting right to your point\n\nPeople do sweat and their feet may", "This blog post explores whether or not they matter.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere is a lot of controversy surrounding the use of cost savings strategies by businesses, such as using cheap prizes and/or cardboard prizes as rewards for consumers. Some people argue that this is a cheap way to bait and switch customers, while others argue that it is simply a cost-cutting measure that has no negative impact on the customer. So, do cheap socks cause problems?\n\n## The problem with cheap socks\n\nAssuming that we are talking about socks rather than stockings, there are a few problems with cheap socks. First of all, they are likely to wear out much more quickly than more expensive brands, meaning that they will need to be replaced more frequently. Secondly, they are also likely to be less comfortable to wear, making your feet sweat more (which should hopefully lead to a reduction in fungal infections and such like, but it doesn\u2019t really make up for the crappy feeling). Finally, cheaper socks tend to be less absorbent, which can lead to embarrassing stains on your clothing.\n\n## The impact of cheap socks\n\nYou might think that cheap socks would be a good thing because they are affordable and accessible to everyone. However, not only are cheap socks of poor quality, but they also tend to cause more problems than they solve.\n\nThe first problem with cheap socks is that they typically last for only a few months. In contrast, more expensive socks can last for years. This means that you will have to replace your cheap socks much more frequently, which can add up to a significant expense over time.\n\nAnother problem with cheap socks is that they are often made of low-quality materials. This means that they are more likely to pill, snag, and rip than more expensive socks. These socks are also more likely to cause skin irritation, as they are often made with harsh chemicals.\n\nFinally, cheap socks are often made in sweatshops where workers are subjected to abusive working conditions. By purchasing these socks, you are helping to support this exploitation.\n\n## The solution to cheap socks\n\nThe answer is not as simple as you might think. There are a lot of factors to consider when it comes to designing and manufacturing socks. Price, fabric, construction, and more all play a role in determining whether or not a sock is worth the money.\n\nCost is one of the most important factors in", "Well, this can be a tricky question to answer. And, there are a lot of different factors to consider.\n\nWe\u2019re going to look at the positives and the negatives. But firstly, let\u2019s explain what we mean by \u2018cheap socks\u2019 because the phrase can cover a surprising range of socks.\n\nA sock might cost just a few cents to make so even a $10 pair can be unusually cheap. The higher the cost of a pair of socks might not necessarily be in line with the quality. It could be that the mark up on the retail price is exceptionally high.\n\nIn fact, we consider a pair of socks priced at $20 or more to be very expensive especially when you\u2019re looking at styles that would be similar in price if you had bought them from Wal-Mart.\n\nWherever possible try and examine a pair of socks before you buy. There\u2019s no substitute for trying them on for fit \u2013 so you know exactly what you are buying. They should be good quality and very hard-wearing.\n\nAny signs of color bleeding? Look up the sock online and make sure it\u2019s not a fault with that particularly pattern.\n\nHow does it feel against your skin? Note when you look at socks online, the material listed could be woven or printed \u2013 they could look great in the photo but the feel against your skin could be another matter.\n\nWould I be proud to wear this? You asking this question is a great indicator because you\u2019ll soon weed out the stinkers on the racks!\n\nLet\u2019s look at the pros and cons of buying and wearing cheap socks.\n\nSocks vs Socks\n\nHow can you compare a $1 pair of socks and a $20 pair and decide which is best?\n\nFactors to consider:\n\n\u2013 if you spent your lifetime wearing cheap socks, do you think that they would wear out quickly making the price more expensive in the end? Would you really save money when buying socks at the lower price point?\n\n\u2013 if you buy cheap socks over and over, that\u2019s quite a lot of trips to the store and quite a few dollars spent. What\u2019s value for money here?\n\n\u2013 if a sock puts you in bad moods and you are constantly fixing it and sorting it out, when do you go beyond the limits by selling yourself short?\n\n\u2013 can", "Most people think that socks shouldn\u2019t hurt at all, no matter how much they cost.\n\nAnd many people are surprised to learn that socks can cause chronic foot problems if they\u2019re not the right kind!\n\nStruggling with constant foot pain? No socks are causing you to have foot, toe or joint pain. You should always find the socks that fit well with your feet to avoid blisters or calluses (we recommend socks with a seamless toe area).\n\nAlso, make sure your socks room around the length of your fingers to avoid any slipping into your shoe. Because no one wants falling over they walking or running!\n\nLastly, know your socks (and make sure that they\u2019ve got storage protection!) Don\u2019t want to get whiplash if you fall over? No socks are a good choice.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t cheap out! Choose the right socks.\n\nHowever, the issues don\u2019t stop there.\n\nClueless about toe separators?\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make in the seams of your socks is to have too many seams.\n\nThe more seams, the more likely you are to get blisters.\n\nFit socks are a must. No one wants stepping out of their shoes only to have it slip halfway down onto their ankle! Have socks with a good fit and make sure they\u2019re not much bigger (or smaller) than the length of your finger to keep your shoes in place (and yourself).\n\nLastly, your socks should match.\n\nNot to be too pedantic, but matching your socks to your trousers can save time and effort.\n\nNot just in time to put outfits together, but if you\u2019re going away, it makes sense, too.\n\nMatching socks can make or break many formal occasions.\n\nMake sure they match your whole outfit or you\u2019ll get found out.\n\nLastly, the thickness of your socks should be kept in mind.\n\nIf you go for socks that are too light or too heavy, they won\u2019t be comfortable. It\u2019s better to be a little cold than have an uncomfortable pair of socks on and freezing toes! Heavy or light, find the best middle ground.\n\nSo remember:\n\nMatch socks.\n\nFit socks.\n\nDon\u2019t go too thick or too", "What\u2019s lost wearing generic, ill-fitting business wear?\n\nWe all like to be comfy at home. Yet a relatively tiny proportion of us want to (or do) wear costly high quality clothes like socks at home.\n\nAs one premium sock maker says, \u201cWe don\u2019t make socks to be worn at home. When we make labels, we put the brand again on the sock. It\u2019s for convenience but it also emphasises that the sock is a luxury item, for business use or special occasions.\u201d\n\nThis exclusivity embodies the idea that wearing socks equals value, emanates a style statement.\n\nMany business people assume they should subsidise costs by wearing cheap socks, where does this impetus come from?\n\nThrough semantics, generalised language and actions, business can alienate others based on genericism. Business dress, including socks, adds new validity to that semantics debate.\n\nWhen a light blue sock is positioned against a charcoal suit, both clash against each other. Generally, something much more subtle is preferred for tonality balance. Pastel colours are the rule too.\n\nIf you are wearing stock footwear, the dress doesn\u2019t take pressure off you. Each foot is taking 150lb of pressure. That makes time spent in bad footwear like wearing generic socks and wearing plain cheap socks a million dollar decision.\n\nIn a business environment, wearing a pair of business socks can really matter. If you buy a pair of cheap socks and they start piling up your big toe or rubbing it sore, then you are losing out.\n\nThe more expensive sock cuts against the grain to make business easier, for you. Lower cost fabric in generic-brand types can easily lead to your feet feeling uncomfortable or burnt after a hour or two of walking.\n\nHaving to routinely stop and paying attention and readjust your socks or shoes and feet tend to lead to health problems. Those negatives may then impact your thought processes. All this, starting with one single purchase.\n\nThis is why bespoke is recommended for most individuals.\n\n\u201cFor too long men have had the short straw on socks\u201d, said one menswear entrepreneur. \u201cThe message we have always shouted out loud is that if you want to be successful, look your best.

What is their cure?\n\n## The similarity between fissures and hemorrhoids\n\nHemorrhoids and anal fissures were initially believed to be unrelated, are now considered to be related. Fissures cause pain when passing stools; this condition is also known as an anal fissure.\n\nSince anal fissures and hemorrhoids share similar signs and symptoms, they are often mistaken as each other. Both conditions cause intense anal pain. Also, both conditions have been known to result in bleeding.\n\nMost of the times, haemorrhoids occur as a result of childbirth or the aging process. Further, these are said to be attributable to hereditary predisposition.

When facing negligent medical care, sometimes a surgeon can damage that muscle while performing a surgical procedure such as an anal sphincter repair surgery.\n\n### How do anal fissures result\n\nFissures and hemorrhoids are results of sphincter tearing due to excessive strain on the anal muscles. The anal muscles remain engaged when one is passing hard stool. Anal fissures can also occur due to high anal pressure while coughing or sneezing.\n\n### Tearing and hemorrhoids\n\nDepending on the extent of such tearing, the condition can worsen. Long tears in the sphincter may result in incomplete recovery or at the worse, complete damage to the anal sphincter.\n\nSuch tearing may result in sphincter muscles without adequate fat supplies. While deficiencies in muscle fat leads in conditions such as hypertonic sphincters, hypertrophic sphincters, etc. All of these conditions can lead to pain in the rectum when passing stools.\n\n### Stool inhibited in transmission\n\nIf such conditions lead to the inability of stools to completely go through the sphincters, then constipation follows. This condition leads to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures.\n\n### Tears that lead to hemorrhoids\n\nA tear in the external sphincter (the lower part of", "That is a question many people have.

Keep in mind that symptoms can be very different from person to person. Before making a diagnosis, your doctor will assess how your symptoms affect you throughout your day-to-day life.\nWhat is a migraine without a headache?\nIt may be surprising to learn that a migraine, by definition, does not always include headache, since a headache is usually what most people associate with a migraine. According to the International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD-3), there are two types of migraine without aura:\nOne that comes alone (migraine without a headache with or without symptoms)\nOne with an aura (migraine with aura but without headache, and with or without other distinguishing symptoms).\nSince a migraine without a headache includes two different groupings, they do have some differences, which will be highlighted throughout this article.\nCommon symptoms of a migraine with aura (without headache)\nIt's important to know that every migraine experience is different. While there are some similarities that may help you pinpoint your symptoms, what you experience may vary from someone else. Here's what you're likely to experience with a migraine without a headache:\nExperience sensory symptoms like auras, including:\nVisual disturbances, such as seeing bright lights, spots, lights flashing in your field of vision, or wavy or jagged lines.\nTrouble with hearing (one-sided hearing loss, hearing loss in your left ear, hearing loss in your right ear, hearing things others cannot).\nAltered sense of touch (tingling or burning sensations, unusual pins and needles or numbness).\nAltered sense of smell (one-sided smell loss or too smelly).\nAltered sense of taste (one-sided smell loss or too smelly).\nTrigger", "The pain isn't particular in any area but I do feel entirely nauseated and the nausea in my stomach is building as I write this (nearly impossible because typing is making me woozier).\n\nI have been getting bleeding of the gums (not just blood, bits of flesh too) off and on this past year or month.

It's still bleeding! Ugh! Anybody have any idea why this is happening?

My right hand now feels crashed and my head is throbbing on the left side.\n\nAlso this: I have been having this infernal itch near where my ear meets the jaw-bone just opposite where the ear headache throbs. Just above that - not on top of my ear, but the bottom of my jaw near my ear. I've never had this sensation before a storm and I really really don't like it at all. It makes me dread my migraine even before it's come about. I am itchy all over too and looking for medication to change this immediately.

In humans, there are individual publications indicating allopurinol related subfertility or infertility. The underlying mechanisms could be a result of a decreased activity of thyroid peroxidase (which seems to be mediated by a reduction of coenzyme A). Associations of infertility with Allopurinol therapy in heterozygous HGPRT enzyme deficient patients, a rare genetic disorder, may rather be the consequence of a decreased folate uptake. Consequences of the increase of xanthine dehydrogenase activity (and the associated increase of oxygen radical stress) or the indirect increase of uric acid levels may be further factors affecting spermatogenesis in an unfavourable way.\n\nClinical use of Allopurinal in adults and in minors is only recommended if the benefits outweigh the the risk for subfertility/infertility that we have identified in 5% (individual recordings).\n\nIf possible, NSAIDs are preferred over Allopurine in order to decrease the risk of infertility.\n\nDaum M, Steinherz P (2002) Allopurinol may decrease thyroid peroxidase activity and may impair gametogenesis.

It is a common condition that affects about 12% of the population. Migraine is characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to", "Very rarely, yes.\n\nThe duration of most migraines last for hours or a few days, but migraines can last for 72 hours or longer. Chronic migraine is defined as headaches lasting 15 or more days a month.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons of why long migraines occur, but it\u2019s clear that a variety of complex physiological and metabolic factors are involved. Testing conducted on children who suffer from migraines revealed a lower level of serotonin than other kids, indicating that there might be a possible connection between serotonin and long migraine attacks.\n\nDiagnosing a long migraine is quite complex. Most recurring migraines have a predictable pattern, specifically in those that suffer from chronic migraines. For future reference, medical professionals recommend tracking certain parameters, including the estimated pain level, the administration of prescribed medications, and the level of response after taking administered medication. Those tracking their symptoms and keeping notes in an activity journal will have an easier time predicting the onset of recurring migraines.\n\nMigraine is a serious condition. Those who find their migraines symptomatic should keep track of their symptoms and check to see if they physically can reduce the pain they experience.\n\nHave you ever experienced a migraine? If so, how long were you physically affected?\n\nImage Source: https://pixabay.com/en/woman-hair-headache-woman-woman-949234/", "Migraine attacks can cause moderate to severe pain (mostly on one side of the head) and can cause sensitivity to light, a tight feeling around the head, and nausea. Pain levels during an individual migraine attack can vary and include throbbing and pounding pain.\n\nDoes it feel like there\u2019s someone in your head? We\u2019ve all experienced really bad headaches that make us want to close our eyes in a dark room \u2014 but what about that one number we can\u2019t stop hearing, or that song that doesn\u2019t seem to quit playing in our heads? Most everyone has some form of self-inflicted inner noise intruding on them at some point \u2026\n\n## Why is my migraine pain on both side of my head?\n\nIf it\u2019s a sinus migraine, the pain can be on both sides. Most sinuses and sinus cavities are on both sides of your face \u2014 that\u2019s why the pain is echoed on each side. A frontal-temporal headache might feel like sharp jabs of pain between your eyes or headaches on both sides of your head where the forehead and face meet.\n\n## Is it normal to have a headache everyday?\n\nMost people don\u2019t get 3,000 headaches a day. But just one migraine can leave them so sensitive, depressed, exhausted, and nauseated that it feels like a full week\u2019s worth of discomfort. Such were the life-altering symptoms of Lara Bloom, 41, of Portland, Oregon, a marketing director for a health-information website.\n\n## How many abortive medications are there to treat migrane?\n\nExcruciating pain anywhere is never fun, but imagine experiencing a debilitating migraine headache, only to have your pain medication fail to work several days in a row. For those who suffer from migraines, abortive medications are a short-term treatment for managing symptoms, and there are quite a few to choose from.\n\nHow much ibuprofen can you take in a day? In general, a dose of 200-600 mg taken every 4-6 hours can give effective relief. For additional benefit, you may add 1 mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol) along with 100 mg of caffeine to every 4-6 hour dose of ibup", "Scary as these symptoms are, it\u2019s important to note that, while severe, they are not an urgent threat to your long-term health. But depending on their intensity, migraines can be nasty and debilitating.\n\nThese are the most common symptoms:\n\n- Pain\u2014often, but not always on one side of the head\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Light sensitivity\n- Sound sensitivity\n\nThese symptoms are true only in the case of a migraine. There is no treatment, only medication. Thus, the best cure is prevention.\nIf you have a family history of migraines, you can lower your risk by living a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThis isn\u2019t easy all on your own. In cases like this, many turn to at-home light therapy to help manage the symptoms that aren\u2019t working around. You should feel comfortable in your office whilst you are doing your daily activities at home.\n\nAsk your doctor about these bright ideas for migraine relief.\n\n## Learn to recognize the stages of migraine.\n\nIf you can recognize the signs of an oncoming migraine and act before the symptoms throw you into bed, you can nip them fast\u2014no pills necessary. You can do this through relaxation and massage or over-the-counter pain relievers. If the pain resolves, you have avoided a potentially miserable day.\n\nIf the world goes spinning and you are laid up at home for hours or days, you have options for managing discomfort and shortening the duration.\n\nTo make matters worse, your doctor has options that can ease your symptoms. The trick is to recognize that you\u2019re having a migraine attack and to tell your doctor about it.\n\nTogether, you can get to know your migraines and figure out the best ways to control and pacify them.\n\n### Migraine phases progression.\n\nThere is typically a carrying window between total silence and the onset of your first symptoms. This silent stage may last up to 12 hours and may not be accompanied by any feelings other than general fatigue and lethargy.\n\nOther times the findings include irritability, depression, sensitivity to light, difficulty sleeping, stomach bowels, or feeling as though a fever is coming on.\n\nAt this time, you have up to eight hours to do something about it. This window is your best time for reducing the episode\u2019s duration and", "The frequency of lightheadedness, the most common indication of the migraine itself, will probably not be greater than three times per month. Pains may vary from a couple of hours to a couple of days.\n\nHow long does the migraine last?\n\nIn most cases, a headache comes on gradually over the course of the week or so, intensifying over the last 24-72 hrs of the attack and more likely to be problematic at evening.\n\nWhat causes lasting migraines?\n\nTriggers could be associated with an expanding wave of activity, engaging parts of the rear of the brain and the psychological hinge on the right side. If the migraine aggresses in the mind, it could be that it stimulates a wave of activity farther and larger than if it comes in the neck.\n\nDoes a migraine last for days?\n\nFrequently, a migraine will last for anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour. Somebody might have a migraine that lasts for days. Frequently a migraine could last for between 72-96 hrs.\n\nWhen should you see a doctor for a migraine?\n\nIn some cases, when a migraine is prolonged and causes much more than acute pain, you should see a medical professional. If you experience particular symptoms during or in the lead-up to a migraine, you ought to seek medical care. These signs include the following:\n\n- losing awareness\n- seizures\n- visual disturbances\n- in case of a severe or seeing aura with throat or arm weakness signs and symptoms.\n- vertigo signs with vision loss.\n- a slow speech.\n- fever and a headache.\n- an unresponsiveness or confused state.\n\nWhere does a migraine attack from?\n\nMigraines commonly start in the temples.

This corresponds to 3,200,000 new HSV-2 infections in the United States in 2000^{a??b}. The majority of these are likely caused by HSV-2.\n\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, perhaps the most common infection affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, is typically asymptomatic. Insofar as herpetic involvement of the GI tract has been reported, it is generally considered a rare and self-limiting infection. Oropharyngeal herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a frequent cause of herpetic stomatitis. It is reported to be the most common nonbacterial cause of external otitis media and tends to be more common in children than in adults.\n\nGenital herpes, commonly caused by the herpes simplex virus, is a very common sexually transmitted disease. It has been estimated that 20% of all sexual partners are carriers \u2014 and may have no idea they carry the virus. Genital herpes is a serious illness and should be treated by a doctor.\n\n## What causes genital herpes?\n\nBoth genital herpes and cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 is more likely to cause oral infections, while HSV-2 is more likely to cause genital infections in adults. There is no specific treatment to eliminate HSV and you must have genital herpes for life.\n\n## Who should get vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV)?\n\nGenerally, gay and bisexual men are thought to have a higher risk of getting HPV than straight men because of their sexual behaviors. In particular, HIV-infected people and people living with HIV have a higher risk of getting and spreading HPV. By getting vaccinated, you can protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases. How is HPV transmitted? The main way people get HPV is through having sex with someone who already has the virus.

I have tried weight lock. It seems to give me the same results as wellbutrin.\n\n### Answer\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer, because weight gain can be affected by a number of factors, including medication. I can see where weight gain might be a concern if you are trying to avoid weight gain to continue your weight loss. However, hydroxyzine is a sedating antihistamine that helps with anxiety. If your anxiety is keeping you from moving around, that could play a larger role in your weight than hydroxyzine.\n\nThat being said, hydroxyzine in not known for causing weight gain, but from what I have read it does have a sedating effect. If you are trying to avoid weight gain through a prescribed sleeping pill, you won't be able to keep your metabolism as high as if you were awake and moving. Since the reason for the prescribed sleeping pill is for anxiety, I would venture to say the anxiety is a bigger issue when it comes to weight gain.\n\nMost doctors will recommend taking some form of vitamin if you are on this type of medication. The sleepiness may give you the shakes in the morning. Taking a B vitamin can help to re-energize you.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n#### QUESTION\n\nWeight loss occurs in the belly before anywhere else.

Get the facts about thyroid symptoms and weight gain.\n\nNo one wants to deal with weight gain; however, the symptoms may be due to hypothyroidism. Many of us have experienced fluctuations in weight. Whether the cause is diet, not getting enough exercise, or even genetics, we want to find that cause to stop the weight gain in our tracks. Doctors step in to help the patient to lose the weight, but are hypothyroid symptoms affecting weight gain? It is possible, especially in women.\n\n## Causes of Weight Gain, Thyroid Symptoms, and Other Factors\n\nThere is a hormonal disorder that causes the thyroid to work improperly; causing a number of symptoms. One symptom may be an increase in weight. Some of the other contributing factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Change in hormones\n- Low metabolism\n- Blood Sugar Level Fluctuations\n\nHormonal changes are normal all the time. We all experience an increase or decrease, but those symptoms are often linked with weight gain. Low metabolism is most likely going to occur with hypothyroidism. While too much active metabolism can lose weight, too little can promote weight gain. When blood sugar levels are off, it becomes very easy to put on weight, especially around your waist. This increase is commonly known as a spare tire.\n\n## Thyroid Symptoms of Weight Gain\n\nThe symptoms of weight gain are quite common for everyone, but, as already stated, there is a chance that these symptoms are also for hypothyroidism. Here are just a few:\n\n- Fatigue\n- High blood pressure\n- High cholesterol\n- Dry skin\n- Mental fuzziness\n- Constipation\n\nTheir symptoms differ from person to person.

What you experience, and what drives you to finally stop the cycle of weight gain is up to you.\n\n## Dealing with Thyroid Symptoms and Weight Gain\n\nYour doctor can give you a series of test to find the exact cause of the weight gain. The doctor can rule out that it is something simple and easy to fix, or could be a sign of a more serious health issue.", "That\u2019s a frequently asked question.  The answer is it\u2019s complicated.  Many people have sub-normal thyroid function and are not overweight, and also many people who are overweight have normal thyroid function.\n\nWhen people with low thyroid try taking thyroid, they may lose or gain weight.  Sometimes, though, the thyroid thyroxine portion of thyroid medicine can actually make some people gain weight.  Usually, thyroid containing thyroid hormone, T3, makes the metabolism increase, and body weight decreases.  Sometimes though, it actually does the opposite.\n\n### What are the most common causes of weight gain in hypothyroid disease?\n\nFirst, I would stress that most people with hypothyroidism do not gain weight.  Some people actually lose weight, and some of these may have difficulty gaining weight.\n\nThis commonly starts in the peri-menopause or menopause, and matures further later. Sometimes it seems like thyroid function declines steadily, but sometimes it\u2019s cyclic, with cyclic weight gain also.\n\nIt\u2019s important to get thyroid checked periodically.  Important is a TSH level, but also FT3 and FT4, together with at least one other thyroid test, usually total T3, T3 reverse, TPO antibodies or Tg Ab.  Many times, people with underlying thyroid issues have causal modifying factors that can impact thyroid.\n\nAn important disease to emphasize is with hypothyroidism, is Hashimoto thyroiditis.  Hashimoto is a disease of the immune system, and immune diseases can trigger as one of their symptoms weight gain.\n\nI think the most common cause of weight gain with hypothyroidism is low thyroid.  In order to get hypothyroidism treated, there needs to be restoration of the thyroid function.  That is usually is an external hormone, T4 thyroxine.  It\u2019s sometimes given with T3, and sometimes, if the TSH is very low, then T4 alone is safe.  Often T4 or T3 takes many weeks and months to generate a weight loss.\n\nOccasionally, the weight gain is related to the thyroid medicines themselves.  If the thyroid medicines utilize the desiccated thyroid, then there are binding proteins", "According to some research, hypothyroidism can cause actual weight gain, and weight loss can be very difficult.There are several reasons for this, but all of them relate to the body\u2019s inability to burn and use calories efficiently.One frequently mentioned theory is that when thyroid hormone levels are low, there is less production of thyroid hormones, resulting in a slowdown  in metabolism.\n\nYour metabolism is directly related to the amount of fat in your body. One of the important actions of the thyroid hormone involves the metabolism of fat in the body.\n\nSome studies suggest that the relationship between low thyroid and weight gain is linked to the impaired ability to turn food into energy. Much of this is due to poor and slow metabolism when you have hypothyroidism.Thyroid hormones, often referred to (T3 and T4), play an important role in your metabolism.\n\nSlow Metabolism and Weight Gain\n\nEnhancing your metabolism can be achieved by many ways, but these must complement each other. Play enhancing constitutes exercising regularly, resistance training, soy supplements, fiber, witch hazel, green tea extract and eating adequate amounts of calcium. However, low thyroid can still hamper the efforts involving these strategies.Here\u2019s how low thyroid levels can reduce the effectiveness of those efforts.\n\n1. Enhancing metabolism\n\nLow thyroid levels can significantly reduce the levels of thyroid hormones in the body such as triiodothyronine or T3 and thyroxine or T4. These hormones can play an important role in fat metabolism. Low levels of thyroid hormones can lead to a low metabolism or slow metabolism.\n\nWeight loss triggered by a slow metabolism means burning fewer calories and increasing to intake calories. When this happens for a group of time, steady weight gain can proceed that an activist is obviously not trying to attain.\n\n2. Thyroid hormone association with proteins\n\nCell lining them play an important role in activating thyroid hormones.

The study to be published in the upcoming issue of JAMA was put out early (July 2018 publication date) by the American Heart Association last week which gave us all a preview of the potential usefulness of metformin.\n\nYou may recall my reporting on previous studies on metformin which had significantly refined its medical profile making the drug popular for its beneficial effects on longevity, healthy aging, and even potentially cognition.\n\n### So what\u2019s new you say?\n\nMore specifically, the question remains as to whether it \u201cworks\u201d.

Metformin belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides; it is an \u201coral hypoglycemic agent.\u201d\n- Metformin has been very extensively studied and is considered generally safe, though about a third of individuals do report gastrointestinal upset with it. In a recent study[1], doctors injected a single dose of 850 mg of metformin quickly into 105 people-a massive dose, several times the normal daily dose. The massive dose caused nausea or vomiting in 14% of the people.\n- In other studies of various metabolic diseases, greater than 90% of individuals have tolerated the drug well-that is, living with metformin without any adverse effects at all.\n- At one time or another, nearly 80% of people taking metformin will experience a mild, easily-treatable side effect, such as diarrhea (see below), heartburn, pain in the stomach or intestines, nausea (this can occur in as many as 30% of prescription users) or flatulence (gas), which tends to go away over time.\n- Researchers from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, recently conducted a trial to determine if the use of Metformin could be beneficial in the prevention of breast cancer in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) [2]. The study involved 351 women who were randomly selected to either Metformin or have no medication at all.

The risk will be higher, if the farm chooses the same antibiotic repeatedly. That is why the choice of antibiotic should be guidance given by an experienced veterinarian. Besides the specific condition of the animal, the degree of condition in the herd, and the potential release of resistant bacteria to the outside environment, are also important, explains Kim Nielsen from Aarhus University, Department of Zoology. In 2015 he completed his Ph.D., where he aimed to make an assessment of the use of antibiotics on Danish pig farms.\n\nIn the research group of Kim Nielsen is currently working on establishing a framework and guidelines on the use of antibiotics on Danish pig farms.\n\u201cWe base the framework on a broad investigation we have made, which indicates that only approximately 20% of the average amount of an antibiotic will be taken up by the bacterial cells, while the bacteria can get resistance to the antibiotic without being killed. An antibiotic is most effective against the \u2018susceptible\u2019 bacteria, and there is a possibility that the used antibiotic may kill the resistant bacteria. This can be the case with critical illness.\nWe formulated the framework models on four pillars:\n1. I don\u2019t use any antibiotics on my farm. The consequence of this strategy is that all bacteria in the farming environment are susceptible.\n2. We induce infection by pathogenic agents such as Pasteurella multocida or Salmonella. The consequence of this strategy is that the susceptible bacteria are killed off by the pathogens and the resistant bacteria are not killed off, this requires one to choose an antibiotic with a broad action spectrum, i.e., that it is not active against pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, which is a risk of selecting for resistance. In addition, other factors can increase the risk of resistance selection; \u2018farm concentration\u2019 and the transmission of the \u2018resistant types\u2019, if this is not known, this will increase the risk of resistance prevalence and selection pressure on the next repetition, than if one choose this type of treatment for the first time.\n3.

Do they primarily possess only one permease protein even though they possess a periplasm. How permeable is its cytoplasmic membrane to hydrophobic/lipophilic/non-polar compounds. This creates competition for the passive permeable entryways. Further substructures such as the LPS found within the glycolipid layer may also help block diffusion.\n\nChemistry. Compounds must first compete with the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer of the lipid layer and have many ways into the lipid domain inside. If hydrophilicity is lost, less entryways are available and we only leech in via passive diffusion. Therefore only hydrophilic membranes are permeable. Unfortunately, there are other genes that can pump out proteins, which reside on the outside and highway proteins that extend from the cytoplasm to block hydrophilicity causing selfish competition and resistance (which it is possible to overload these: Berg with three types of antibiotics that easily clear one another).\n\nExperiments show that more symmetric compounds diffuse through the membrane much better (methyl at alpha an beta carbon increases.

Your jeweler can help you find a lubricating saline ointment that can't pass through the metal pierced into your skin. However, the first couple of weeks of healing, you probably won't have to use the ointment either.\n\nWhy do we need to be able to put ointment on the piercing if it's pierced? If you think about it, the nipple is never sterilized because the natural environment around the skin is part of it! It takes a lot of purity to keep the nipple open and closed, and the first few people to get pierced have to know how to keep them from closing which can create problems if they get close to each other! It's just like having sex: if the hole isn't completely \"sealed\" by the female orgasm, the site can be sore until it's healed! And just like verbally, if the penis isn't completely \"sealed\" by the female orgasm, risk of infection increases.\n\nWhile piercing is a \"not a natural occurrence\" for the nipple, it is said that most piercings cause the same infection that can occur if it weren't pierced this way. Most people I know have minor cuts on their piercing that come within a few days to 2 weeks after it heals, so they don't lose their nipple for fear that it might be ruined by being pierced. While piercing the nipple doesn't add any additional risk to the nipple, it does carry a higher risk of infection from the type of shield that is used. Those shields are generally made from fairly thin gauze, which is not the best for preventing mold if you don't use it.\n\nWhile the remedies that are GREAT for a particular part of your body can also affect other areas of the body, using natural remedies like about the home is not a bad idea when it comes to your body. In fact, some are so good, that I would use them for my entire body! https://maleface.com/treat-acne-face-pimples-", "-- Nancy G., Amherst, Mass.\n\nConsider this: It's highly likely that many ancient native women got their nipples pierced. Women in many worlds today are getting their nipples pierced. We can presume that ancient moms dealt with breastfeeding despite nipple piercing. Here's what to do: After the initial piercing \u00ac-- when the jewelry hasn't been inserted and the piercing hasn't begun to heal yet \u00ac-- there shouldn't be a problem massaging your sore nipples, as you would when not breastfeeding. Once the jewelry has settled into the new piercing, breastfeeding can be tricky, as the piercing on the new mother precludes nursing right away. But a woman who has previously healed her postpiercing breast could be able to breastfeed right away. (Do check with your piercer.)", "Ointment can be used on piercings. There are special types of ointment that have been formulated for piercings. If ointment is used, be sure to use a very small amount, because it can clog and collect in the piercing. People usually put it on the areola (rather than on the nipple).\n\nWill diamonds become cloudy over time?\n\nOver time, the diamonds will get a cloudy appearance on their facets: across the surface of the diamond. If they are cared for properly, though, the diamonds' surfaces should continue to sparkle.\n\nWill my piercing close up without regular cleaning?\n\nOnly if new skin grows over it, will it close up. Unlike the tongue, lips, and other piercables, the body does not have any existing non-pierced holes to eliminate the need for regular cleaning.\n\nWhy won't the hood of my tongue piercing ever cure?\n\nThe \"hood\" is not meant to cure! Many people only want part of the tongue pierced, and that's okay. The portion of the piercing that is visible should always be maintained. There is really no such thing as a \"hat-rack\" or \"homegrown\" tongue piercing. A hat rack is when the flesh grows back, \"naturally\" re-piercing the tongue after healing. A homegrown tongue piercing is when you put your jewelry back in after healing, which means you have to go through the whole piercing process (initial piercing pain, swelling, mouth sores, etc.)\n\nWhy does my chest jewelry hurt when I move?\n\nJewelry with long posts, or that are poorly made, tine jewelry, clasp jewelry, or anything that is prone to moving.

Don't worry. Each piercing takes its own time to heal. There might be factors contributing to more healing time, you should get in touch with the piercer who did it and tell them what problem you are facing now. The best course of action I can think of is to make sure the area is disinfected so there are no possible infections. Do so with the advice of your piercer.\n\nKeep your tongue clean using a tongue cleaner or brush. Don't use too much force that would cause more damage.\n\nOnce the piercing closes up, never go and get it redone.

Most herpes viruses are contagious.\n\nHerpes is recurring, meaning that fever blisters return twice a year, but the frequency and severity can differ from person to person.\n\nOn the other hand, generally, canker sores are not contagious, although they are prone to spreading, but they only last a short period of time, sometimes 1-2 weeks and can be widely noticed. Canker sores result from an infection within the mouth, or as a result of an injury.\n\nSYMPTOMS AND RELATED CONTENTS FOR CANKER SORE VS. COLD SORE VS.

Your blood pressure will no longer be taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer.\n\nHow do I start taking blood pressure?\n\n1. With your finger, pump the bulb until it is nice and firm. The target is 160-180 mm Hg. A blood pressure cuff whose inflation is 130-150 mm Hg with the bulb squeezing and releasing is not pumped firm enough to accurately read blood pressure. Reach for 160.\n2. At the cuff inflator valve, close the valve (cross the black line on the sphygmomanometer intentionally) and pinch its opening to temporarily hold pressure and avoid falling pressure as the bulb releases.\n3. Slowly release the bulb to the right and not left. Tapping, loud noises, and loud talking will affect recording the top number and reader reaction.\n4. If you are using a digital monitor, take the reading off the unit immediately and then check relation to mercury.\n5. If you are using a mercury sphygmomanometer, wait three seconds to listen with stethoscope to heartbeat followed by the brachial artery pulsation. We count the first of these two beats as 0 and the first real number, the systolic pressure, as 1.\n6.

It is fair to say that these variables also influence blood pressure readings. Blood pressure readings, just like those for height, length, and pulse, undergo a variety of factors apart from the environment in which they are being measured.\n\nWe now have 4 readings, or triplicate readings (3 times simultaneously) in the lab (72 hours apart), to try to get an \u201caverage\u201d of the measured value; we must provide an estimate of the detection Limit on the standard error of the mean for those 4 readings to get an \u201c", "What are normal blood pressure values?

As a rule, a difference of less than 20 mm Hg is considered normal.\n\nThe graph of the change in blood pressure and pulse is often called a hormonal profile. It is the ability of its value to change at an extremely high rate and thereby pass information about the state of the body's functional system.\n\nOf course, there is still no cure, but there are a lot of medications that are used to treat hypertension. The first line of treatment is the use of medications that lower blood pressure and help the patient achieve target blood pressure levels.

It is more common in people who swim or bathe frequently.\n\nOtitis externa can be treated with antibiotics or antifungal medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to drain the ear canal.\n\n## What is the most common cause of otitis externa?\n\nOtitis externa, also known as swimmer\u2019s ear, is an infection of the outer ear canal.

It", "Otitis externa, also called Swimmer's Ear is a common infection of the outer ear which may be caused by anything that irritates the ear canal, such as shampoos or sports gears.\n\nFirst, doctors are still uncertain about the exact cause of the condition. Otitis externa might be caused by certain kinds of bacteria (such as staphylococcus), like Superficial fungal infections, mites, allergic reactions to earplugs and cauterizing material, and irritation by soap or foreign body striking inside the exterior ear. Fungal ear infections, allergies, as well as a weak immune system might also cause otitis externa. This examine noted that earplugs made from natural wax, by growing the development rate of S. saprophyticus, can be potential in causing otitis externa.\n\nSecond, what you do not understand is you will get otitis externa. As an example, should you use the corticosteroids (such as Prednisone) to treat a different disease. Contamination of the eyeglasses hand-grip and manoleum to the ears is likewise a source of infections and the bacteria frequently discovered in bathrooms hangouts, where the ears can be traumatized could likewise cause otitis externa. Another risk factor is the use of cotton swab or pen cap that aren\u2019t clean before being used to clean the ear. You might get otitis externa after bathing in water.\n\nSuperficial fungi can cause otitis externa. That is a kind of fungus that affects skin which is normally caused by Pityrosporum ovale (malassezia folliculorum). The ears of individuals with poker dermatitis are more likely to get otitis externa. Fungi also can infect the ear through constant using earstuds, ear helmets, or swimming. What kind of fungal infection is this?\n\nOtitis externa with fungi that reside in the skin may be due to overgrowth, and that overgrowth in the ears occurs occasionally. Fungal infection can happen all year round, but it\u2019s more prevalent in the summer, frequently prompted by the thickness of skin that develops sweat or even sebum. Besides the environment, fungal infection also can be caused by a variety of activities and habits prior to these", "When a person develops otitis externa, the area around their ear canal is affected, says Vahid Javidi, MD, assistant professor of clinical medicine at East Carolina University Health Sciences Center in Greenville, N.C.\n\n\"Otitis externa involves the skin and canal of an entire human ear, or about 5 percent of the ear. The other 95 percent is the middle and inner ear, both of which can also be affected by similar problems,\" he says.\n\n]Common causes include shore. Others include physical irritation \u2014 scratching, rubbing, shampoo getting into the canal, and wearing hearing aids and ear buds, says Paul Berger, MD, board-certified general otolaryngologist in Boca Raton, Fla. \"Anything that can damage the protective barrier of the ear can lead to otitis externa. Sometimes trauma or surgery will lead to otitis externa.\"\n\nIt can occur for no reason and strike both men and women at any age, he says, but women are prone to suffering the earache because they have longer hair. Plus, makeup and hairspray can cause it to flourish.\n\n### Who Is at Risk for Developing Otitis Externa?\n\nThe condition is common enough to warrant calling otitis externa by several names, including \"swimmer's ear\" according to the Mayo Clinic. Bladder infection and swimmer's ear are hall and parlance, but anyone can get it. The only groups at special risk have to do with a vulnerability to bacteria or a rapid growth of bacteria.\n\n\"People who swim have water in their ears, which makes the area moist and warmer than usual,\" Javidi says. \"If the warm water is there for more than 16 hours, it creates a good environment for bacteria to grow. That increases the risk, as does having a foreign body in the ear, such as a hearing aid. Rarely do we see other problems of the ear canals, such as cancer, that may allow bacteria or fungus to grow.\"\n\nAnother susceptible group includes people with skin conditions, such as eczema. \"Skin conditions, like dermatitis, increase the risk for otitis externa,\" he says. \"Patients with diabetes may also be more likely to develop this condition, as well as patients", "This unpleasant condition occurs when painful bacteria and fungi invade the external ear and cause inflammation. Typically, otitis externa develops as a result of infections from other bacterial diseases inside the ear, but can develop due to poor hygiene. With the infection, you should see extra discharge from the ear with a mild sour smell. Usually, otitis externa pain symptom is the most common complaint for individuals with this condition.\n\nYou can get this annoying infection by other infectious diseases, such as herpes, tonsillitis, or scarlet fever. The infection can also be caused by certain allergic reactions.\n\nSometimes, bacterial infections can make otitis externa contagious because they can spread from one infected host to another. Since bacterial infections are known to mimic systemic infection, including viral infection, it\u2019s not often detected.\n\nIn this case of a minor infection, you may want to clear the infection first with home remedies or with the OTC pain reliever like acetaminophen. If the symptoms are nagging, you may want to ask a doctor to prescribe oral antibiotics and/or topical medication.\n\nKeep reading on when Otitis Externa pain lasts more than a few days.\n\n## Types and Causes of Otitis Externa, how to get otitis externa?\n\nThere are four main types of otitis externa:\n\n1. Acute external otitis\n\nAcute otitis externa can occur in children and adults who have impaired immune systems. Children with some skin conditions or genetic diseases, such as eczema, may be more prone to develop acute bacterial infections in the outer ear. This is the most common cause of infected ear pain.\n\n2. Acute and chronic external otitis\n\nAcute infection condition affects the external or outer part of the ear canal where the production of fluid is very rare. If it is involved with chronic infection, it is in the external part of the ear (outer ear) leaving fluid behind.\n\n3. Bill Fun Gland ear infections\n\nThe bacterial infection can also affect the structures that are associated with ears, nose and throat (ENT). As a result, the Tanner Tube ear dropping can exist and infect the tissues as it spreads along the ear canal wall.\n\n4.", "In people with hyposmydrosis (a reduced ability to sweat) or hyperhidrosis (over sweating), mixtures of bacteria and fungus can proliferate in the secretions leading to an infection that can result in inflammation of the ear and possibly severe pain. Swimmers can get it from water that gets trapped in the ear canal after a swim.\n\nIs Otitis Externa painful? As a result of swelling, inflammation, and discomfort, otitis externa is commonly known as \u201cswimmer\u2019s ear.\u201d People suffering from this condition may discover that their ears are incredibly itchy. Despite the fact that this irritation might induce a desire to scratch, this action should be avoided.\n\nHow do doctors treat external otitis? The doctor will commonly prescribe antibiotic drops into the ear, unless problems such as pressure changes and/or fever are present or suspected additional infection is present. It is a good idea to follow the instructions provided with the medicines used for chronic otitis externa.\n\n## What does tinnitus in the ear feel like?\n\nWhat is it like to have tinnitus? When you have tinnitus, you may perceive a variety of sounds. Ringing, hissing, ear clogging, or whistling are among them. The sound intensity associated with it can range from hardly noticeable to unpleasantly loud. The sound\u2019s location may or may not be specific; it may sound as if it\u2019s coming from within your head or just in one ear.\n\n## Which of these are contagious?\n\nTMJ\n\nPassive TMJ and active TMJ are the two types of the disease. It is most common in people who engage in activities that necessitate holding their heads in one direction for an extended length of time, such as musicians and construction workers.\n\n## What is Swimmer\u2019s Ear?\n\nSwimmer\u2019s ear is a condition that affects the outer ear. Water gets trapped in the ear canal because of the condition. If the water contains dirt, it can cause an infection or inflammation that results in ear pain. Symptoms and Causes\n\n## Can external otitis heal without antibiotics?\n\nIt is possible for otitis externa to heal on its own if it is not severe enough, but it can take up to two weeks", "I\u2019m asking because it turns out that I do now, or have been for some time. And I don\u2019t know how I got it. Because, I once read in WebMD \u2013 and I quote (although as I was reading this to myself in my head, I didn\u2019t note who was quoted): \u201cThere is no doubt that getting business-class care is better for your health than getting first-class care.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m nowhere near being business class care, but I thought about my care for a moment. My ears were leaking wax for just a few seconds here and there. Then one day they weren\u2019t leaking. But I noticed one of my ears was hurting this morning so I stuck a douch bag in there after my shower. After draining the cup, I saw there was a water filament hanging from inside my ear. I pulled that out and it had a black, fleshy flap that was soft most of it, and harder, with some kind of ridges near the end. I pull this rubbery flap out of my ear canal. I see no blood but it still hurts, so I go online to look up curable ear problem.\n\nThat\u2019s generally what happens. I don\u2019t have quite enough anxiety or shortage of energy or trust in humanity to actually head down the street to the free clinic and find out what I have from someone who can actually give me an in-depth, same-day diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics and whathaveyou because so far as any quick literature search tells me, this kind of swabbing of the clinically constipated ear canal is hurting. Either because that flap was flesh torn from my ear, or because this kind of injury isn\u2019t clean, hasn\u2019t completely healed properly, some inner ear bit of manure has begun to proliferate without a doctor or nurse to notice it. If I ask about it, they say things like, oh yes, a pinpoint tremor or something and send me on my way with masks, or some kind of care.\n\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no\n\nYes, I\u2019m using the word manure. No, you don\u2019t have to worry about my language here, because I\u2019m the one with the ear problem, not you.

Have you ever checked your heart rate? Maybe when you are exercising, or maybe right after you are done exercising. You can check your heart rate by holding your fingers over your pulse and count how many pulses you feel in 6 seconds. Double that number and you have your heart rate.

This term refers to changes in the interval between heart beats.   Variability encompasses a wide range of factors:  emotion, autonomic nervous system state, thirst, sleep quality, etc.\n\nIn a more restful/restorative state, the interval between heart beats will be much greater, this state is identified as having a higher level of HRV scores on a resting basis.  In a more potentially stressful state, your autonomic nervous system (ANS) is in a higher state of activity, which causes the heart to fire more continuously and rapidly.  This state has a lower HRV score.  It is useful to understand how much information is being processed by the brain using HRV.\n\nWhat does it mean to have low/high HRV?\n\nIn context of performance, it is best to think of a bell-curve as it applies to the differences in scores.  The outliers on either end may indicate stress, whether it be greater stress from overtraining, or a lack of stress induced by chronic inactivity.  The middle of the bell-curve is where you want to be in terms of training effect, not too much nor too little stress is optimal for consistent performance.  Our goal is to facilitate measured movement toward the middle, so you may take the greatest advantage of restorative rest, and maximize your training load potential.\n\nWhat are some other reasons for HRV being calculated?\n\n### Stress, as an independant variable, can actually be measured by HRV (Where mood is a dependant variable). These results have been validated by thousands of scientific studies and have shown a very close correlation of these two variables. This allows athletes to manage their emotional state, in turn, managing physiological balance.\n\nAccording to mindparil.com, elite athletes rely on mental resilience, or the amount of frustration and fatigue a person can feel, but be able to bounce back from.  MindParil claims that the elites have higher stress tolerance.  This concept seems to make perfect sense from a mental/physical standpoint.  Athletes who can remain calm in the face of adversity, such as an epic comeback in the 4th quarter or a 5th set, knows where the limit is on their state of mental", "Both are measures of your cardiovascular activity during rest or activity. Below illustrates comparison of these two heart rate variables. Understanding the distinction between the two can help you feel better, train better, and improve healing of the body. After all, health is all encompassing!\n\nDifferences:\n\n- Resting heart rate can adjust in the short term, but this adjustment is enacted at the cardiovascular level, specifically the sympathetic nervous system. It beats faster to compensate for the body activity.\n- HRV is more of your cardiovascular master clock. The heart uses the electrical conduction network within the heart to contract. This network varies in its reports from cell to cell across the heart. These reports can correct irregular times for conduction to a normal pattern within a heart beat. If this master clock is deficient with poor variability, more variables or timing differences are present to conduct this beat. It is an ANS problem not a cardiovascular problem.\n\nHRV provides insight into your internal clock. Can your body find the right rhythm?

Parties may, in the alternative mode of resolving a dispute, try to find solutions during what is called \u2018mediation\u2019.  Here each party takes the opportunity to state their case and explain their position.  After this there can be solicitor/client consultations to further negotiate a solution.  The mediator can make suggestions only if all parties agree.\n\n2.

For example, treatment will follow a different path for mycoplasma, chlamydia, and gonococcus infections. Mycoplasma infection requires macrolide antibiotic therapy; chlamydia is eradicated with azithromycin or doxycycline; and gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics. These antibiotics can be given orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of the patient's condition. If your doctor suspects the presence of an STD that causes PID, he or she will usually send a sample to the lab for testing and confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn the case of acute PID, antibiotic therapy is the first line of treatment. Other treatments that may be considered include surgery to drain a pyosalpinx or an abscess, bilateral salpingectomy, removal of ectopic pregnancy, Caesarean section, and IV therapy (IV antibiotic treatment is very important to control potentially lethal toxic shocklike syndrome). When patients receive one of these treatments, antibiotic resistance is less likely to occur.\n\nSurgery is also needed when conservative treatment with antibiotics has failed, endometriosis develops, or there is residual problems or pelvic abscess.

A test for chlamydia and another for gonorrhea should be considered for all sexually active women annually or when at risk and for any woman attending a family planning clinic for the first time [22].\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease therapy is not easy only because the diagnosis is difficult; proper treatment depends upon a careful medical and surgical history and a thorough understanding of the pathological mechanisms including", "For diagnostic purposes and just prior to deciding on treatment, your baby\u2019s urologist will conduct a working physical exam and might order imaging scanners (eg. ultrasound sonar imaging) to be able to map out the extent of your baby\u2019s urologic condition.

It has a very long duration of action. So long that when I was working in the ER I used to joke that you can start the second dose 30 minutes after you finish the first dose - and be completely covered that whole time.\n\nThe reason this long action is important is because all NSAIDS have an effect on the stomach, liver, or kidneys. Generally speaking, it is better to cut down on the number of doses, rather than the drug dose itself.\n\nIf you do need more ibuprofen, go ahead and use it again.\n\nAll My Best,\n\nSpeak with your doctor about the effects of NSAIDS if you have heart disease or a history of heart attack, since prostaglandin inhibitors can cause heart attacks, or stroke. NSAIDS also can interact with blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin, a medication your cardiologist and/or primary doctor may prescribe for people with heart disease.

Clinically it is acceptable to use ibuprofen and naproxen as needed walkable on an as-needed basis. Indeed it is recommended to use both based upon \"joint burden\" with one in the morning and the other in the evening. Ideally one would wait at least two hours between the start of one dose and the other however this is not a strict requirement.

It is only emergence of vaccination and a lot of convenience of hygiene that allows us to survive the winter. We have much better chance of mutating into a food virus but given the ease of humanity getting sick all over the world, that isn\u2019t going to happen. This type of question gets asked a lot and it isn\u2019t something to think about. There are so many types all across the species; to try to ask the same question would be like asking how long does breathing last. It is not possible. Some say because vaccination have never been a significant factor in the history of the flu that it isn\u2019t one of the more significant of these viruses. Modern medicine has allowed us to live longer but it\u2019s science is nothing but a few tricks. We never looked into vaccinating the season. We did not really address the ocean season. Seasons would be used to protect vaccination. The point is likely here to that people are going to be sick and they will not feel well and there will not be much motivation but not to make it to late to work or to sleep often. The flu leaves traces that nobody really knows. However you need to start thinking about it. If we all start thinking we are going to get sick we will get sick. How long does it last? That is the wrong question. How it progresses, why it progresses, these are all the wrong things to be looking for. What we should be doing is working on new and controversial ideas.\n\nSome people don\u2019t seem to understand that the definition of life is mutation. We agree that the flu does last indefinitely, therefore so does life. A few of epidemologists think that what\u2019s specifically interesting about the flu is that it mutates so quickly that it seems to have qualitatively different immunities as spread along different mutations, giving that a shorter limited term. This isn\u2019t likely to have practical benefits, since limited duration of the epidemic is probably not what the epidemiologists said when they were talking about reason for caution.", "New strains of influenza pose a greater threat during the flu season. \u2018 Quite serious cases that require hospitalization are about one day or two days longer than a normal flu. In winter, when the weather is colder, and our immune systems become less efficient, influenza tends to be more serious.\n\nHow dangerous is the flu?\n\nIn general, the flu is dangerous for small children, the elderly, and people who have some predisposing illness. There are serious complications associated with the flu such as Bronchitis and Pneumonia. For otherwise healthy individuals, most often, the main concern of the flu is just getting over it.\n\nCan flu kill people ?\n\nThe flu can kill people especially if the flu is sepsis or septic shock in people with reflux, or bacterial pneumonia. However, it is rarely reported to be fatal and most patients be cured with rest, fluids, and aspirin.\n\nHow It is important to prevent the spreading of flu in the community if you are infected?\n\nBesides getting yourself treated in a prompt manner to relieve symptoms, It is important to prevent the spreading of flu in the community if you are infected. Staying in your house for over seven days and practicing cough hygiene are going to help your community and avoid the spreading of flu.", "For most people, symptoms last from 5 to 7 days. Fever may last for up to 3 days. One can start contagious before you even begin feeling sick, and you\u2019ll be contagious for a few days after.\n\nDespite early symptoms, flu can pop up as an initially upper respiratory infection. 24 to 48 hours later, you\u2019ve got head and sinus symptoms \u2013 more soreness in your throat and cough, and now even with nasal congestion.\n\nUsually this second phase starts with a fever. You may feel profound fatigue, exacerbated by the coughing accompanying some worsening of the head and sinus symptoms. This may go on for 24 to 48 more hours and then you\u2019ll go on to a getting quite a bit better phase.\n\nSubstantially decreased coughing, some clearing of the sinus and nasal congestion, some alleviation of head symptoms, and also some improvement of the throat soreness. You may start to have normal energy levels, frequent eating, improved mood and better sleep.\n\nThis final phase, often the first improvement symptoms, can last anywhere from 24 to several days, with only minor setbacks as long as your continued recovery.\n\n### What if lingering cough lasts more than 1 week?\n\nAbout two thirds of people with flu will have a cough lasting more than 1 week, but also most have a cough lasting 2 to 3 weeks. These individuals will have a community for some years, likely at low intensity. They are sensitized to potentially react more strongly to a subsequent winter virus infection.\n\nA bad dry cough is a distinctive symptom of flu. Whether that intensity depends on your immunity, age, and extent of the first infection. According to Anita Pinto, MD, is a board-certified infectious disease specialist and an associate professor of epidemiology and global health at the University of Minnesota. I think about 85% of people will have cough symptoms, and about 40% of people will have cough symptoms after 3 weeks.\n\nMost people will talk about how they are \u201cover\u201d the flu, however the cough remains. While there\u2019s nothing wrong, this prolonged dry cough is a dead giveaway for a cold. Yet another flu is not ready to happen.\n\n### What", "Generally, a person\u2019s in \u201cfull-blow\u201d flu for 5-7 days will cover them all (even all of their potentially really easy ailments).

Can I get the cheapest source of ibuprofen pills at the lowest cost? ml.prank.\n\n## How Much Ibuprofen Is In 200 Mg Capsule: What Is Considered A Dose?\n\nAn answer to this question depends on whether you\u2019re getting the full amount of ibuprofen in the capsule or just using it to relieve pain. In other words, taking ibuprofen does not mean you can take more than the amount that is recommended for a particular condition or activity.\n\nConsidering this, how much ibuprofen is in a 200 mg Tylenol? I can take 3 tablets every 4 to 6 hours for up to 4 days. Each tablet contains 200 mg of ibuprofen\n\nsubsequently, is 200mg of ibuprofen a lot? A better question is what the lowest, most effective dose is. Most people take 200mg or 300mg of ibuprofen in one dose. I know that Americans in general (we don\u2019t know the background) take 800mg once a day. But it also depends on whether you are a daily user or a user at the start of your menstrual cycle.\n\nWhat happens when you take 1000 mg of ibuprofen?\n\nGeneral use: The recommended dose for adults is 400 mg daily. An extra 600 mg at bedtime may be necessary. To raise your blood pressure: Take 600 mg daily. To prevent migraines: Take 400 mg daily. To reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases: Take 400 mg daily.\n\nHow much ibuprofen is safe?\n\nThe maximum dosage of ibuprofen is 400 (miligrams) mg every 20 (minutes) minutes. There is no evidence of an increased risk for heart attacks or strokes with these lower doses, but there is caution to be noted. Never take more than 400 mg (1 gram) at a time. Never take more", "Are they safe for long-term use? What do I do if I miss a dose? These questions may have arrived together with the pain, upset stomach, or headache that you're now facing. Take heart; our guide will help you sort it out.\n\n1\n\n## What are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs?\n\nYou've no doubt heard of aspirin and other pain relievers that end in - \"n\" with a hyphen. Specifically, we're talking about the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen that are widely marketed for pain relief, postoperative conditions, and fever or inflammation, to name a few. Most of us refer to \"Excedrin\" and \"Aleve\" as \"NSAIDs.\" While those are technically branded drugs, they contain ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin as the active ingredient. NSAIDs are among the most widely prescribed of all drugs in the United States, but they are not without side effects. If you've sought out NSAIDs to treat your back pain, headache, or arthritis, you've undoubtedly asked your healthcare provider about these potentially harmful \"little pills.\"\n\n2\n\n## Which NSAIDs are the most commonly used?\n\nOn the right is a very comprehensive list of NSAIDs and their uses. You might be perfectly familiar with ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or aspirin, but did you know ethacrylic acid and oxaprozin are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? All white blood cells (WBCs) make prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are eicosanoids that have various anaphylactic and/or local effects, such as inflammation, fever, and pain. They are produced from the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acids by the cyclooxygenase enzyme system, via peroxidation of the oxygen atoms followed by isomerisation of the cis double bonds. The NSAIDs decrease COX enzyme activity. COX-1 is found primarily in platelets and in gastrointestinal cells. This is why it is not desirable to take NSAIDs for extended periods of time. N", "I already know the answer to this question as I\u2019m sure you do. The standard package of ibuprofen has 200 tablets of 200mg. Pretty often, people have bad practice to swallow 3 tablets at night if they have bad pains. Ibuprofen is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Each person has his own period when he takes painkillers. There can be no exact dosage. Women usually tolerate pain better than men. If you look here http://www.adventslive.wordpress.com, you will see more details. You may find some dose regimens there, like how often and how long to take ibuprofen or what is the maximum dosage. Sometimes we just want to take some more ibuprofen when we feel some discomfort, but scientists have established a daily dose of 1200 mg that can only be exceeded in rare cases.\n\n## Are you going to buy ibuprofen online?\n\nIf you googled the \u201cibuprofen buy last pill\u201d, you\u2019ve got a lot of proposals with prices, dose and how to protect your private data. Just be careful with selection of the site you are going to buy your medicines. Some of the proposals may be little suspicious. If you\u2019ll order the drug and then cancel the shipment of your order, you can be found guilty of the so-called \u201cInternational EconomicDrug\u201d and you can be prosecuted under the \u201chttps://northstand23.com/xanax-withdrawal/\u201d law. Every medical phenomenon has a negative side. An uneducated use of this drug can have negative side effects on the body. The main and most negative effect of long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs is the disruption of the production of carbon dioxide. This leads to various disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, constant use of ibuprofen tablets causes gastritis and stomach ulcers. In some cases, internal bleeding may occur. Gastric ulcers and gastritis can be a major cause of acute pain.\n\n## Let us talk about contraindications and side effects of ibuprofen.\n\nyou can \u2018t buy ibuprofen if you have intolerance or allergy to anti-inflammat", "The maximum amount of ibuprofen per dose is typically 300 milligrams, or 200 grams for 2-year-old children. For adults, ibuprofen should be taken every six to eight hours. For 2-year-olds, the dose is 100 grams every four hours (300 mg / 200 ml). Use only the amount of ibuprofen recommended on the dosage instructions, and never exceed the maximum amount of ibuprofen per dose.\n\nMost people who get hurt while participating in physically demanding activities (e.g., running, swimming, cycling, etc.) have a pain threshold of less than half a milligram of ibuprofen. This is typically less than 20 percent of what is considered to be a normal dose for most healthy adults.\n\nWhat is the maximum dose of ibuprofen on the night before a race?\n\n\u2013 I understand if you want to take ibuprofen the night before a race, but how much should you take? As long as you don\u2019t exceed the daily dose, ibuprofen can help you get a good night\u2019s sleep the night before an endurance event. If you are planning a road race or race with severe terrain, however, you should take ibuprofen as soon as possible. The best times to take ibuprofen are three to four hours before bed and three to four hours after exercise. I personally like to take ibuprofen 100 milligrams before bed and again 10 hours after exercise.\n\nWhy do you use ibuprofen weekly to relieve joint pain but don\u2019t use it on a daily basis?\n\n\u2013 It is a pain reliever that has a widespread global use. It was developed in the late 1950s as a way to treat pain and the resulting inflammation in people with osteoarthritis. And that\u2019s exactly what it does\u2014most of the time. And that it\u2019s a pain-reliever. One primary concern of using ibuprofen, as well as any other NSAID, is that it\u2019s referred to as a prescription drug and it\u2019s illegal to be used as therapy outside of a doctor\u2019s supervision. So, doctors won\u2019t even recommend it without a prescription.

The location of the pain can provide some clues as to the cause. Right lower abdominal pain can be caused by a number of conditions, including appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and urinary tract infections.\n\nAppendicitis is a common cause of right lower abdominal pain. It is a condition in which the appendix becomes inflamed and can lead to a rupture if not treated promptly. Symptoms of appendicitis include pain in the right lower abdomen that starts as a dull ache and then becomes sharp and intense, nausea and vomiting, and fever.\n\nDiverticulitis is another condition that can cause right lower abdominal pain. It is a condition in which small pouches called diverticula form in the lining of the colon and become inflamed. Symptoms of diverticulitis include pain in the lower left abdomen, fever, and changes in bowel habits.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. It is often triggered by stress or certain foods.\n\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) can also cause right lower abdominal pain. Symptoms of a UTI include pain in the lower abdomen, frequent urination, and burning sensation when urinating.\n\nIf you are experiencing right lower abdominal pain, it is important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation.

This pain spikes during the night. There is also a slight burning sensation when passing urine. I checked my glucose levels and nothing serious. Is this a symptom of quinsy? How can I find out more convincingly?\n\n## Answers (1)\n\nYou should immediately visit a gynaecologist or an ultrasound specialist who can do a comprehensive transvaginal ultrasound and check if there is any ovarian grape-like fluid collection (this is called a cyst). If detected, immidiately go for a gyrnacology consultation. A CT scan may be suggested at this time.\nDo let us know what you find out from all those tests.", "You might consider a CT scan of your right lower abdomen.

And now the ECG (electrocardiogram) results shows non significant blockages. I know smoking is one side of the equation ... anyway he replies that he has genes or family history so that probably he is bad cardiac patient.\n\nGenetics does play a role in heart disease, but it is not a dominant gene. It is more likely that lifestyle choices have much greater impact and there are other factors that may play a role. While you cannot change the family history, adults who smoke have the option to stop. I would like to point out that smoking cessation substantially improves mortality. For those who have trouble quitting may require a pharmacological approach in the form of a nicotine gum or patch. Alternatively, he could increase his aerobic activity as well. Nonetheless, if your neighbors concerns are whether or not they should be worried about having a genetic predisposition for heart disease, they should speak to a geneticist to get more information.", "I do not have a fever .

One must keep in mind that her stress levels or emotional distress may have caused her pain. Stomach pain with stress is called visceral pain.\n\nBladder infection\nBladder infection is an infection that affects the bladder, and is caused by bacteria. Bacteria normally found in the anus can be distributed to the genital region via the rectum. In some cases, the bladder must be emptied without delay in order to avoid more dangerous problems such as kidney infection. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also be caused by viruses or other germs. Bladder infection is likely to recur. This occurs most often in women and in certain individuals who suffer herniated lumbar disc. The reason is because women 4 to 5 times more likely than men to suffer from UTI.\n\nGetting pregnant and giving birth effects\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by typical symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain ... It represents one of the many problems of the gastrointestinal tract and its cause remains unknown in most cases.\n\nFood intolerance\nSome people have food sensitivities that trigger gut-related symptoms. Talk to your doctor, who can refer you to a dietician or nutritionist who can put you on an elimination diet to help identify the foods that are to blame for your symptoms. A major cause of intestinal problems is an inappropriate level of acidity. For example, the food contains additives which are considered \"exaggerated\" e.g. beans are rich in gas-forming carbohydrates known as raffinose. If the stomach is not producing acids properly and if this is marked by the symptoms of acid reflux disease, foods with high gas-forming carbohydrates", "momo\nhola, welcome to our community.. must you endure this pain for the past six weeks ? is it stabbing pain , itchy of dull ?... in addition, is it getting better or worse by time ? has any specialist examined?\nPosted Mon, 10 Jul 2017 in Abdominal Disorders\n\nAnswered by Dr. Sophie Griffiths 8 hours later\nHello, and thank you for using the Ask the Doctor Service.\n\nI assume that you have not returned from Colombia or you have some other reason to ask this question.\n\nA lot of people worry about having appendicitis, but they don't realise that it is far more common in children and young adults than it is in middle aged people. If you haven't had a scan, this would be a sensible thing to do as a feeling of pressure or fullness is a very characteristic sign of uncomplicated appendicitis. On a scan, the appendix shows up as a little 'sausage' where it joins the colon (large intestine). If it has become infected the appendix will be 'raised', bulging because of fluid swelling around it. The scan will also show whether there is any pus inside the appendix - if there is any pus it is likely to have burst. The condition is called appendicitis with peri-appendiceal abscess.\n\nSometimes appendicitis starts off more subtly, with symptoms of increasing general discomfort, loss of appetite and sleep.\n\nThe last stage of appendicitis is when the appendix has burst, and this may be accompanied by a violent illness - vomiting and very painful gut. This is typically an emergency situation and it is important to seek surgical help urgently.\n\nSo sometimes people confuse mild appendicitis for severe period pain, kidney pain, bladder infection or an ovarian problem. It is important to be confident either way, and if what you tell your doctors doesn't make sense, it is possible that there may be some communication gap. It doesn't feel right for a doctor to ask you to wait longer for a scan, especially when you are in this much discomfort.

From what you have written, seems like you have several concerns about your overall health and not specifically did you ask about the elevation of your ALT. ALT is specifically a test that shows your liver\u2019s work condition. If your ALT level is elevated this means that liver is struggling to function properly and not works as efficiently as it should be. The medical term for this is abnormal liver function and is associated with a liver irritation/ damage.

Most cases of diarrhea can easily be addressed by properly hydrating the body.\n\nSeek out for treatment if the symptoms don\u2019t get better after a few days or if the diarrhea is severe.\n\n## What Causes Diarrhea?\n\nDiarrhea is a disorder where there\u2019s a rapid passage of liquid from one\u2019s small intestine to his or her colon. There is a sudden withdrawal of fluids and inadequate absorption of electrolytes, like sodium, potassium and chloride.\n\nThere are three broad categories in regards to its causes. These are the organic, inflammatory and infective causes.\n\nInflammatory \u2013 The term inflammation refers to immune system activation by some type of invader.\n\nIleocolitis is a disorder wherein inflammation involves both the large and the small intestines. The irritation of the large or small intestine may have some relation to inflammatory bowel disease or IBD and food intolerance. Other causative agents include:\n\n- Stress\n- Digestive system traumas\n- Irritant symptoms\n- Chemical intolerance\n- Bile acid intolerance\nDiarrhea Causes Chart Diarrhea Causes Chart\n\nInfective \u2013 Diarrhea caused by infections can be brought about by a variety of viruses, bacterial or parasites. In this step through series, I am going to describe the most frequent infective gastrointestinal infections.\n\n-     - A virus may cause vomiting and diarrhea \u2013 including viral RNA or strands which include calicivirus CDV (stripe or norovirus), polio, astrovirus, pico or parechovirus, rotavirus, and adenovirus.\n    - PGD or paragonimus Wuchereria bancrofti \u2013 a parasite that is found in Angola, Congo and Ivory Coast.

Dr tested me before and said my uterus looked great\nHey Trista, I am not sure if you are already aware of this, but a Procedure such as D&C is where we look into a uterus that is bleeding and get a surgical biopsy to figure out what is going on. There's no harm in doing the procedure since we don't know what is going on with things, I suppose it's going to give us a chance at doing some aggressively treatment if needed. And if we are lucky, it is a less serious issue such as an infection. Either way, I would strongly recommend to schedule that D&C, no point to delay it.

How do I turn the immune response to my favor after exposure to an animal infected by the fast spreading rabies virus?\n\nWhen I received the email from a Biohacker from Brazil, I realized that rabies would a perfect topic for my new blog Rabies Fear. So this is the first article in this series.\n\nI would never have thought that rabies is actually a trending topic in biotweets, bioblogs and biohacker circles. Rabes virus is one of the most fascinating virological characters, depending on the hosts it is transmitted by and the context the virus encounters:\n\n> The RABV was one of the first viruses to be developed as a vaccine. This is remarkable in that the host range for RABV is extreme: with known associations from hantao bats to badgers and from armadillos to wolves, raccoons, giant pandas, skunks and humans. The nearest known biological relative is the bat Lyssavirus which is known to produce a human-infecting vaccine in bats, pandas and ferrets.\n\nThough the virus is highly neurotropic (loves the nervous system) in nature, it is also neuroprotective when the virus is present in the brain tissue! (1) This appears to be due the fact that myelin sheaths, the \u201cwhite matter\u201d of nerves, are made from long acyl chains of fatty acids (fat), components that are missing from the viral genome. Replication of the virus inside brain tissue requires resources derived from acylation or glycation cycle substrates, biofuels that are necessary to\u201d connect\u201d routes between connective tissues throughout the body. There are at least six separate routes for making acyl-glycans, and nine separate routes for making acyl-lipid molecules in the body (Lyssavirus does not have the latters and the former are produced only in the central nervous system, unlike myelin sheaths). Lyssavirus is highly dependent upon complement factor-H for cytoprotection occurring in infected cells. The ability to hijack lipid acylation or proteoglycans is a driver of the rapid brain dysfunction, described specifically in terms of enzyme anomalies found exactly where the myelin sheaths are disrupted in nerve", "The Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) and World Health organization (WHO), recommends that travelers to Brazil receive the yellow fever vaccine. After a yellow fever epidemic in Brazil, the vaccine may not be readily available. For this reason, you should purchase and carry along with you a Certificate of Vaccination (yellow card), as proof that you have received your yellow fever vaccine. Without proof of yellow fever vaccination, the Brazilian authorities may detain and quarantine you for up to six days. You can also be turned away from Brazil and sent back to your country of origin. Make sure you receive your yellow fever vaccination at least 10 days before your trip.", "As a general rule, healthy adults are not required to receive any pre-travel vaccinations for a one-time visit to the country you mentioned. But before you make your list of places you want to visit during your stay, consider your itinerary because the area you\u2019ll be visiting will determine your vaccination requirements. However, it is advisable that you are vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Furthermore, you may also consider being immunized against meningitis and hepatitis A to be completely safe.\n\nAnd we always recommend taking a comprehensive travel insurance plan to prepare for any health issues you might encounter.

The symptoms of this illness can be acute, usually appearing 3 to 12 days after exposure. The virus is transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes, and its incubation period is 3\u20137 days. Mosquito repellent is available on our website.\n\nDengue fever \u2014 Dengue fever is endemic in Brazil.", "I saw the article about the yellow fever vaccine.

It is a 1 dose vaccination that lasts for long time after vaccination.\n\nIf you travel in a region with risk of dengue, you should take the vaccine against dengue. It consists of 3 doses of immunization that lasts for 4-5 years.\n\nHepatitis A is enzootic in Brazil, you should be sure you have hepatitis A vaccine prior to travel.

I was told the vaccine is good for \u2019til first born into a family. (Doubtful as the booster dose has to be timed 10 years later.)\n\nNot to forget people generally get yellow fever as they hike by the Amazon Rainforests, get bitten by infected mosquitoes.

April is the dry season, and apparently it is exactly this month where there is a spate of mosquito borne disease.\n\nWord around the campsite is that yellow fever numbers are jacked up a bit because US companies are subsidizing the population to get the jab.

Most prostate enlargement problems are seen above the age of 60 but that does not mean prostate problems cannot occur at a younger age.

It is not the case that the common problems of younger men equate to prostate cancer. Many prostate disorders require surgery to open the urinary tract \u2013 especially those of the younger man.

I had HZ nearly two years ago and still get neuropathic pain. I tried various medications for those symptoms, but they just ended up with side effects, so I went off everything almost a year ago because we think they are drug induced although I was not originally on anything (no SSRI or NSAIDs). I found that tapering helps with the overall symptoms and makes them less irritable. I wish it wasnt necessary, but I havent been able to stay off.\n\nSo, less than 3 months ago, I started having pain and twitching in my left leg or up to the calf. It is a dull ache and seems like it travels up and down the nerve of my leg. It comes in spurts and varies in severity. The muscles above the knee joint feel easily irritable and twitch. I would read all symptoms like mine online and it would say they were cramps since I wouldnt twitch with intent. Besides these symptoms (which lasted longer than cramps), I get occasional paresthesia in the soles and tingling in my toes and soles. I dont get the burning. Constant itching IS during the night wakes me up. It is most prominent on my left foot but I can get it anywhere on my body.

The exposure to was from me since he leaves for work at 5:30 and doesn\u2019t get home until after 10. By then, any reactions are worse for him. I am doing much better than he is after exposure. We didnt have this much contact until the Saturday I was going through the worst of my breakout and had to bathe with my husband who, as I said, would be going to work the next day. I dont believe I used olive oil but I understand wouldve made it worse if he touched me and got it on his skin.

I think he may already be experiencing the hydroxyzine on accolate. I cant find anything out about that so I know very little.\n\nWe have tried diligently to cover his skin with soap and wash and rinse it. He takes the Precocide suppositories after taking the hydroxyzine, and has already completed one box of Accolate. I havent had any poison ivy patches so I cant comment on that.

'TSH' is short for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.  This is a vital hormone made by the pituitary gland to stimulate the thyroid gland to make more thyroid hormone and release the hormone into the circulation.  If there is too much thyroid hormone circulating it will suppress release of TSH and if there is too little thyroid hormone it will cause TSH levels to rise.  Higher levels of TSH are always followed by therapy to increase these levels by increasing thyroid hormone production and release.  The TSH free hormone is measured as T4 and T3 but the best standard test is within the thyroid gland for free T3.  The best blood measurement is for circulating free T3 but the test is expensive.  Therefore the best standard test is one for free T4.  If you are already on a trial of thyroid hormone replacement for what ever reason (known medical disorders such as Hashimoto's or other medical disorders, weight management, cognitive issues) and are showing too high serum free T3 or serum T4 it can be an indication that too much thyroid hormone is being made and taken up by the tissue.  How does this happen?  If the dose is too high higher circulating hormone levels will rise levels of T3 and T4 more rapidly.

I had to finish school this month so I did not mention it to any doctors, or even prescribed any steroids to my sores, because I really had this and that problem at that time. On December 10th, I saw an herbalist for the stings. He prescribed echinella plus some other herbs also. Within 10 days-2 weeks, shingles showed on my face on right side. Then, my doctor conformed with the diagnosis (after consulting the path by a microscopic stool analysis) and prescribed several steroids: Zanaflex, Eutonyl (2.5mg), oral prednisolone, decarbondimedine as well as acyclovic. He immediately noticed that prednisolone works well with the virus, and prescribed it for 1 week.

Is he or she wrong? Why or why not?\n\nIt depends on the case. In reality, colchicine is the first line of defense against gout but often times it can wear off fast so a lot of times it\u2019s used in combination with other medications for many to treat gout well.\n\nShould I take colchicine with food or without food?\n\nColchicine is safe to take with or without food but the side effects of stomach upset is often alleviated by eating with colchicine.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between generic colchicine and brand name names like Mitigline?\n\nThe name brand versions like Miticol has less of a chance of side effects than the generic versions.

Colchicine can reduce your gout pain in as quickly as one hour, and in most cases in 2-8 hours. Colchicine can be a safe medication in the short term. It is prescribed for the short-term treatment of acute gout episodes, but it can cause unpleasant side effects around the stomach and bowls.\n\nColchicine can be taken as a capsule or an injection. It may also be added to a gout diet to block the amount of uric acid the body produces. This is referred to as long-term use of colchicine. This long-term use may be permanent or until a gout treatment plan (like Uloric or Allopurinol) stops making uric acid crystals and reduces the risk of new attacks.\n\nWe encourage people to start with the lowest possible dose and then increase the dose until they find a dose that they can stay at for more than 30 days and feel safe with. Alternating between doses and alternating between different uric\u2013acid treatments is not recommended.\n\nColchicine can also be taken in combination with medications called urate augmenters. These medications increase the number of uric acid crystals that are created from the diet. This increases the anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine and reduces the risk for new gout attacks by reducing the amount of uric acid that is released during a gout treatment.\n\nIf you follow a gout diet, the best time to take your colchicine is in the morning because if you eat a healthy diet, you will not be releasing uric acid while you are taking colchicine. Although it is a natural alternative to gout medications, it can be uncomfortable. If you find that you cannot stand the side effects of colchicine, reduce the dose to 1 pill every day for a few days, or a few times every week. For example, if you have to take colchicine three times a week on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, take 1 pill on the other 4 days of the week and 2 pills on the other 2 days of the week. Then, slowly increase the number of pills you take one or two pills at a time every 3-4", "The medication, Colchicine is often prescribed for the treatment of gout. Colchicine stops the body from producing uric acid. Doctors often prescribe Colchicine for patients who have acute gout attacks \u2014 immediately before they start, or pain starts. Currently, Colchicine is only available with a prescription and must be taken in tablet form. Colchicine, however, is not the most popular treatment, due to extreme side effects.\n\nWhat is Colchicine?\n\nColchicine is truly an age-old remedy for gout. It is an alkaloid derived from the Colcha plant, a type of jimson weed found in Africa. It is often compared to the alkaloids quinine, strychnine, and morphine. Because gout is caused by high uric acid levels, the goal of Colchicine is to lower the production of uric acid within the body. While it may help to relieve some of the symptoms of gout, it will not prevent gout altogether; you must still remember to limit the amount of foods you eat that produce high uric acid within the body.\n\nWhat is typically prescribed for gout\n\nThere are many medications patients will be prescribed when it comes to the treatment of gout. Two types of medications that will be prescribed to patients suffering from gout include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), medications that reduce uric acid levels. These include allopurinol and Probenecid.\n\nUsually, the best treatment for gout is prevention.

All good bacteria is also killed by this process. Taking probiotics along with antibiotics can help reduce the side effects of antibiotics such as nausea, diarrhea, gas, pain etc. It is particularly effective when gastrointestinal symptoms are expected/occur along with antibiotics. The ideal ratio is approximately 10 to 1 in favor of lactobacilli to reduce the risk of side effects. As far as timing is concerned, it is recommended that probiotics can be taken 1-2 hours apart or 1-2 hours before/after the antibiotic, whichever is preferable to you. These 2-hour spans are based on gastric emptying half-life and will allow acidic gastric juices to fully inactivate the antibiotic before probiotic travel through the digestive system, and then inactivation will take place by probiotics*", "Taking it 2 hours ahead or taking it 2 hours after?

This can be tough to remember because most people don't think about questions like this until they are faced with an actual issue themselves. This is why we created takeoz.org \u2014 so that people will be able to look up information quickly when they need it and not have to scramble for their phone or laptop if their answer is somewhere online!\n\nBefore you can get started with takeoz, it is important to know where your brain is at. We're going to give you some of the tools that will help you get there and start thinking for yourself again.\n\n### What is Take oz?\n\nA reader asked us what Take oz is all about. I gave him a one-word answer. It's psychology. No, no-no. I didn't say what it means, so meh \ud83d\ude1b \ud83d\ude42 . Anyway, that was me again.\n\nDuring my trip to Taos, I learned that Take oz is an event and a process. It's also a movement and a way of life.

What really surprised me was how he pointed it out as a practice, not simply a thought. What did it mean? A leader has to practice, not just a thinking exercise. It works against the natural flow of the human mind which has to stop and peel off the present, thinking about the past, acting out of emotion when something comes up, and focusing on getting ready to make tomorrow happen before you know what happened yesterday. His formula goes something like this:\n\nTEAM (Take Oz) \u2013 the present point in time = our day\n\nSOROS = Time + Change = Progress\n\nThe practice today will always be the next day, next week, or next month.

This drug is not only used to treat depression, but is also often given to relief sleep or insomnia complaints. The side effect experienced often causes the patient to feel sleepy the next day, so it must be taken at bedtime or right before going to bed.\n\nAfter using this drug, drink plenty of water and avoid heavy meals or food that is too fatty so the side effects do not appear. This medicine has been proven to be safe only when taken regularly under the guidance of a doctor.\n\nThis drug side effects are:\n\nSedation, dizziness, weakness, sleepiness, arrhythmias, tremors, hyperactive symptoms, headaches, hangover, sensitivity reactions, blackouts, skin rashes, menstrual disorders, acute angina, hypertension, dry mouth dizziness, difficulty asleep, asthma symptoms, confusional states, and carbohydrate cravings.\n\nThis drug is classified as a Pregnancy Category C pregnancy medicine that can cause damage to the unborn fetus. Therefore, avoid taking this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nI hope this answer helps.\n\nTrtzldn", "Do you / may need to take these every night? Usually, trazodone is used to decrease pain. It may take about a week before any benefit occurs. Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without your doctor\u2019s advice.\n\n- It can slow down your breathing and may cause other side effects, such as taking it too early in the evening.\n- The Mayo Clinic does not now support this information, OR recommends this information.\n- Find out more about this medication.\n- This material should any health care provider should assume the course of treatment or actively receive medical care.\n\nTrazodone is usually well tolerated, but, side effects may be a risk of use. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor s should be taken at least 2 weeks prior to discontinuation. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, be sure to first discuss with your physician the benefits vs risks of taking this medication. If you need surgery, tell the surgeon or ane\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adthesiologist ahead of time that you are currently taking an antidepressant of any kind.\n\n> Serious allergic reactions can happen with these medications, such as anaphylaxis. Changing or stopping your antidepressant prescription could trigger a relapse of depression. You\u2019ll take trazodone with water either once or twice a day, depending on the medication strength. He will inform you how long to use it and how to safely stop the treatment.\n\nTypically, medications make you fall asleep, and that\u2019s your focus, and you\u2019ll feel groggy the next day. Make sure you do not take the medication on a daily basis, unless your doctor advises you. People should not take alcohol and trazodone concurrently. I don\u2019t think so \u2013 I take them once a day at bedtime (and have done for many years \u2013 two decades). Depression is as common as cancer; Major Depression Disorder, the kind of depression we are talking about here, affects about 15% of our population.\n\n### Does trazodone help weight gain?\n\nPeople who take trazodone usually gain weight after they begin taking the medication. The drug can raise prolactin in the body. That, in turn, can cause you to have a loss of libido. Females may also experience menstrual problems.\n\nThey will", "I have been taking it daily at bedtime for the past 6 months with moderate sedation (too tired to work, at times).

Are these parameters \u201cset in stone\u201d for everyone? Can you give me some clarification  because I am researching personal situations described on various forums/posts.\n\nHHJ Poirier responds:\n\nPlease bear with me \u2013 as you might note, my answers start reflecting the information on this topic that has emerged over time but I am doing my best to keep them up to date.\n\n## You are not alone in having continuing symptoms\n\nAt the time of writing this article, many research groups such as those at Imperial College London and the University of Toronto, describe similar types of symptoms in a large number of patients after acute COVID-19 (please refer to the full article for the list of studies). Most of these groups call these symptoms \u201cpost-COVID-19 syndrome\u201d which is a mouthful. The media has also started calling this syndrome \u201clong COVID\u201d which is a simpler term but there is a problem with this term: none of the COVID variants (not just the Omicron variants) lingers in our bodies after we recover, so we have lingering symptoms (\u201clong Cons\u201d), not \u201cCOVID\u201d symptoms.\n\nOn the positive side, it is comforting to know that many researchers are interested in this subject and are making progress. However, more clinical trials that track the recovery process must be undertaken in order to confirm and better interpret the associations observed in the studies to date.\n\n## Post-acute symptoms vary, occur in clusters and might be related to Covid:\n\nAlthough some scientists and politicians think that post-vaccine complications could simply be events that would have occurred despite the vaccination, emerging evidence suggests that the risks after vaccination are Either lower or limited to specific symptoms such as headache, localized mild fever etc. It is reasonable to hypothesize that these symptoms represent a resolution of inflammation following exposure of naive immune systems to foreign elements in the vaccine. Thus, in contrast to symptoms after acute COVID-19, post COVID-19 sequelae appear to be linked to the interaction between Covid variants and", "pain Lupus Outcomes Study analyzing the three control cohort I evaluated the response to exercise relative to other baseline characteristic about 18 months after enrollment.

You can\u2019t go wrong if you go to your doctor who, if nothing else, will order blood tests to rule out certain things. If the symptoms persist, the tests will often offer some clues for diagnosis.\n\nThe medical literature does highlight a few limitations with the test that results in an elevated CPK indicating etiologies of rhabdo. Therefore, we need to realize, the more common type of etiologies have a few things in common. The test is sensitive to muscle damage but not specific for it, so many things can lead to muscle damage.\n\nSome of the more common ones we also find off the top of our heads. Someone who drinks excessively, oftentimes will be admitted to the intensive care unit with a high CPK level (this muscle enzyme), but they happened to stop drinking for a day or two, and the lab result with an elevated CPK level might not reflect the liver being damaged. So, they did not have alcoholic hepatitis or a disease that they had developed to the extent that they couldn\u2019t drink or didn\u2019t want to drink. So, alcohol would be a common point. Medications can also lead to it. If a patient has taken a statin, for example, for years and years, sometimes the muscle enzyme can be elevated perhaps because statins do sometimes lead to muscle damage, it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of to get an elevated CPK level.\n\nOften, if we measure muscle enzymes and we find, say a myositis (muscle isting) occurs secondary to an infection, whether it be viral or bacterial, or other inflammatory, they tend to be weak, they will also have an elevated CPK and that would be the alert that something is wrong.\n\nAnd I mentioned earlier that rhabdo can affect many groups in our society. The group that is at the highest risk medically (not pointedly to HG enthusiasts, but just generally) is the alcoholic, who is in the ICU. When you put that in a box with middle-aged, well the stalker and", "Should you be concerned?\n\nProbably not. Most likely the soreness is from exercising muscles that are not used enough, or having attacked a new training exercise. The good news is that most cases will pass by within one week and really, they could have happened even after the best work-out in the world!\n\nThere are many solutions to the pain and here are our suggestions:\n\n1. Warm down\n\nCooling down is the best way to regulate muscle activity and therefore to prevent or reduce muscle pain. Exercise in moderation and avoid rapid activity changes. Cardiovascular exercises (activity to raise heartbeat) are often useful to prevent long muscle pain. Proprioception can be enhanced by stretching your legs and arms.\n\n2. Embrace water\n\nMassages or hot baths can be really effective on the muscles. In both cases the key is to relax and slow down. Professionalfull-body massages will penetrate the muscular tissues to relieve contracted muscle groups, but do not be shy about letting the Massuse know where they are causing the most problems because we understand that some areas may be too tight to touch and this can prevent a deep treatment. However, this doesn\u2019t diminish the serenity and relaxation from massages. Moreover, hydro-massages are excellent at relaxing all the muscles, but often these areas may feel quite numb, therefore it is recommended to go for a manual massage after (or before) the water massage.\n\n3. Activity\n\nThere are many remedies for this concept: regular exercise, fresh air against some body parts, exercising with friends for a boost. However, every remedy is not useful to everyone and some is more natural than others. Other advises are: more water intake, lemon juice, meditation, laughter, sleep, less coffee, less alcohol, less smoking; alternatively a post-workout drink with fruit content.\n\n4. Intimacies and friendships\n\nWhile this is often enough for many, the \u2018magic cure\u2019 will be different for many others; catching up with a friend, girlfriend, wife, family or lover, hugging and kissing, making love\u2026 can be enough! However, sometimes the muscle pain requires more standard treatments. This is why\u2026\n\n5. If you can see red\u2026 visit the doctor!\n\nLastly, for severe pain, go and see a doctor", "Muscle aches, otherwise known as soreness and tenderness are a result of tired muscles, specifically around the surface of the muscle. It is characterized by a dull or deep throbbing pain that can occur anytime due to muscle damage to the connective tissue. The person may also feel sore and stiff, and can be tender enough to hurt them. This type of discomfort is felt immediately following a hard workout  that has caused micro tears in the muscle fibers. Exercise injuries due to over use are common in many sports.\n\n> ### Always gently massage the painful area to prevent tissue adhesions and promote blood flow.\n\nJapanese People\u2019s emphasis is on the use of muscles rather than the joints when seeking to prevent injury. Remedial massage therapists use many different techniques to treat a stiff or sore muscle to counter tenderness and discomfort. Advanced massage techniques and pressure points regularly remove scar tissue and work to align the muscles to ease tension.\n\nWhen an injury occurs, inflammation destroys the integrity of the muscle and can lead pain and soreness which frustrate the healing process. The inflammatory process that is set off requires the healing body to engage its own built in intelligence by refocusing its attention from healing scar tissue to the muscles surrounding it. Only after the inflammatory process has passed through the entire healing process and then its residuum becomes the fibrous scar tissue that knits that broken or torn tissue or nerve back together.

In fact the withdrawal can have the effect of causing the condition to be worse than it was before. Treatment with medication should always be medically supervised and carefully monitored, especially if it involves stopping a particular medicine. Some medical conditions require you to take the medication for the rest of your life.\nThere are different kinds of anti-depressants and they vary in the way they work and the side effects they produce. They will have different withdrawal characteristics. Prozac (or the generic name fluovrsamine) inhibits the re-absorbtion of serotonin in the brain, which in turn can reduce the uke of excess of serotonin which can cause depression. Withdrawal of Prozac should be gradual, which will prevent a number of negative effects like dizziness, headache, vomiting, and insomnia. Do not stop it abruptly. Tell your doctor what bothers you the most from Prozac not work.\nProzac usually stays in your system for about five weeks after your last dose.

What many people don\u2019t know is that as advanced as Teeth on Adams is as a healthcare supplement, Abreva\u2019s combination of Phenylethyl Alcohol and Docosanol is still far more effective than any of the other products of the same make. It is quite likely one of the best cold sore treatments on the market, particularly in comparison to its contemporaries.\n\n## That being said, is Teeth on Adams actually more effective?\n\nWell, it most certainly has a reputation for being effective in preventing some of the worst symptoms of things like frequent tooth decay, excessive corona symptoms and migraines,", "While some patients have moved onto this product because their physician has already discontinued it, there are others who insist on using it.\n\nIt\u2019s the first and key product to be given the nod for treating cold sores. However, it\u2019s been noted that some people reacted poorly to it and the length of time they can get affective results is about the same as with any other cold sore treatment out there.\n\nSince abreva is normally the only FDA approved product for cold sores, some doctors will still recommend it before moving onto other treatments. standard treatment, though, includes topical preparations like Abreva and Lidocaine but then doctors start making suggestions for lifestyle adjustments when abreva won\u2019t cut it.\n\nSo, what are these suggestions?\n\nThose who are prone to get cold sores are recommended to steer clear of the following if they do not want their next cold sore to get the opportunity to live, make that fester, and grow:\n\n> \u00b7 Smoking\n>\n> \u00b7 Any kind of cosmetics\n>\n> Also the following is suggested:\n> \u00b7 Avoid bacteria or infection\n>\n> \u00b7 Avoid anyone that has a cold sore\n>\n> \u00b7 Keep your hands and utensils disinfected while serving hot meals, etc.\n\nIt is indeed possible to treat cold sores without resorting to medications. But, since cold sores appear as a sudden eruption, following the above lifestyle tips will help you to prevent a cold sore from breaking out. If this serious case of oral caffeine does not happen, you will not need any abreva or any other topical treatment and all you need to save you from the embarrassment might just be a little lip shell.\n\nA caffeine patch can be quite useful, too. For the record, caffeine does not absorb as easily as nicotine but for the purpose of keeping the cold sore hidden, it can work wonderfully.\n\nWhat happens is the abreva (Abreva ) actually helps control the eruptions and the visible redness of the outbreak. Most dermatologists will still prescribe it along with their prescriptions for healing. However, it has been found these gatherers can leave the skin prone to infection as well.\n\nThere is another form of caffeine that can be used when treating cold sores. This", "Yes, abreva is still good to use. In general, cold sores are always caused by the herpes simplex viruses (HSV). They are known to affect about 90% of people worldwide. Luckily, you can prevent these sores from exposing themselves to the sun. Be sure to cover them up as much as possible. However, there are those that are just not interested in this kind of prevention. Therefore, it would be worth it to you if you got the opportunity to get rid of them - like, cold sores for example.\n\nHow do you get rid of cold sores? There are several ways. You could seek medical treatment or go for home treatment. The latter refers to treating cold sores at your home. This is a lot more convenient than seeking medical treatment.\n\nThe Home Treatment\n\nWhen you are trying to cure something at home, there are several ways of going about doing so. One of them would involve using one of the many over-the-counter medications that treat cold sores. These come in various forms. They may either be ointments or creams.\n\nAbreva creams qualify as one of these forms. It has managed to win the name, \u201cWorld's Best Cold Sore Treatment\u201d. So, if they have such a title so plastered on their name, then they must be useful in some way. In fact, they are useful in that they do cure cold sores. But what do you need to know before using abreva?\n\nKnow Your Tongue\n\nAbreva creams do work. But it is strongly advised that you wait until your tongue and skin are completely dry before they are ready to use the abreva ointments. Failure to do so would mean that they would not be effective.\n\nThey would wear away before their full benefits come forth. Also, if you happen to be taking certain medication (ex. aspirin), it is advised to stay away from them while you want to make use of abreva creams.", "I\u2019ve used both abreva (docosanol) and Blistex brandlipsil hypoallergenic ointment for my cold sore flare ups and had far less frequent recurrences and the conditions lasts less than a day.\n\nDrugs that are antivirals do not act 100% of the time because you can have a stubborn cold sore that you just can\u2019t get rid of and it bothers you no end.\n\nAbreva is something I used to use avidly but perhaps they changed the formula or something because for me at least these days it ain\u2019t working no more.\n\nShall we go over some other options to rev up that resistant cold sore and get your lip back in shape?\n\nTiger balm, anyone? Okay, I\u2019m not taking this comparison seriously.\n\nCheck out how some people dealt with resistant cold sore lesions which took several weeks to heal. Yikes.\n\nSearching Reddit threads on this site have not yielded much info on this question.

Augmentin contains 1 pill to be taken twice a day, the Amoxicillin clavulanate needs to be taken 3 times per day and Amoxicillin only is taken 3 times per day. These antibiotics may be taken with or without food.\n\nThe side effects are usually the same, that is diarrhea that may or may not be accompanied by abdominal cramps. Of the other side effects, the rash seems to be more common with augmentin.  For some reason, reactions to amoxicillin seem to make the person feel ill as a whole, whereas reactions to either of the others, beauty individuals usually just feel ill, not as well, less energetic, perhaps a little febrile, but do not actually get sick.\n\nIt is very possible that this is just a tale around the Jewish peninsula that , Augmentin is still used.", "0\n\nI was prescribed Augmentin for a sinus infection. I just read that Augmentin consists of two anti-biotics\u2013\u2013clavulanate and amoxicilin. Is that the same as regular amoxicilin? If not, why would I use amoxicilin over regular amoxicilin, if they are both just anti biotics, right? What makes amoxicilin better or what is it supposed to do that clavulanate isn\u2019t already supposed to do?\n\nThat will be great if you can answer these questions.\n\n1 Answer\n\nAugmentin is a penicillin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like bronchitis, and many types of pneumonia and certain infections of the ears, nose, throat, skin, and urinary tract. These usually include skin rashes, stomach disorders, and diarrhea. Ordering Augmentin no prescription without a doctor\u2019s prescription is highly made up this accomplished after a purchase is placed with a online pharmacy.", "Can these two be used interchangeably or for the same medical condition? Augmentin contains Amoxicilin, but Augmentin also contains clavulanic acid. Amoxicilin is a semisynthetic aminopenicillin antibiotic indicated for the treatment of a wide variety of infections caused by penicillin-sensitive organisms. Clavlucanic acid is an inhibitor of beta-lactamase, an enzyme that inactivates antibiotics. It adds synergy to amoxicillin because it prolongs its activity when the bacteria being explored for produces beta-lactamase. This combination inhibits the bacterial destruction of amoxillin and extends the spectrum of activity to include Microbial species that many produce beta-lactamase.\n\nThese two can be used interchangeably in patients whose condition that they are treating is not impacted by the addition of clavulanic acid. As far as I can tell, amoxicillin and its augmented form of amoxicillin which is called Augmentin or amoxicillin with clavuclanic acid are indicated with mild and moderate infections. Moderate infections as in osteomyelitis bacterial pneumonia, septicemia, pelvic inflammatory disease, bone and joint infections, soft tissue and skin infections, and intra-abdominal infections. They can also be used to treat various mild infections like otitis media, strep throat, tooth abscess, and vaginal infections.\n\nAugmentin is also indicated in uncomplicated urinary tract infections like acute cystitis in adults. Diagnosis of what particular bacterial strain has resulted in your infection has a lot to do with you the treatment is going to be. Just to show you how synergy works, let me give you an example, If the bacteria producing the infection did not produce Beta-Lactamase your amoxicillin supplement would only be effective if your bacteria made its measmalam just to the right of the lacking ninth being one can also wait until an enzyme that would rely in order for me to take action.\n\nBut if the enzyme is already inactive, the actual action upon which the Lassie,.

It strengthens the fight of the flu and other infections.\n\nIs there a vegan version of credence?\n\nI\u2019ve always been a vegetarian so I\u2019m not sure.\n\nWhat is the difference between credence and credulousness?\n\nCredentialism\nIt is a formal, legal requirement.\nThis is a type of \u201ccredence\u201d.\nCredentialism\nIt is an agreement made between two people before they go on a mission.\n\u201cCredence is a term used when you don\u2019t believe something before you go and check it out,\u201d according to the New York Times.\nIs it really credibility?\nThe word \u201cCredence\u201d does not imply authority or power by itself. You don\u2019t need a certain amount of credence (a.k.a. credibility) to make a statement or make certain claims about a subject.\n\ncredence also does not imply you\u2019re going to put yourself on a pedestal to judge everything. If someone says he or she doesn\u2019t have enough credence to speak on certain topics, then maybe they don\u2019t have the right amount of credence to be making the statement.\n\nI\u2019ve heard from people who say their credibility hangs on what other people think I have credence. It can be a very subjective obsession.\n\nThe real problem, for some, is that it\u2019s not really credibility that\u2019s at issue. Rather, it seems that some individuals want to be right.\n\nCredence is not accuracy, but an agreeableness, completeness, or correctness thought by the learner that is not shared by anyone else and that can\u2019t be observed by any external authority or evidence.\n\nThis is the very point that I\u2019ve seen others make here and elsewhere over and over: People on the one side of the spectrum that are the most certain of something, the ones who insist that we should all respect their opinions unconditionally, are the ones that are actually the most credible.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nSomeone with complete credibility will insist that they are right about whatever you say and tells you to do with 100% of their authority what they think, no matter what your feelings and what facts would be. They won\u2019t say", "Answer: Augmentin and Amoxicillin are both antibiotics. They are both from the Penicillin family and work in a similar manner.\n\nWhat is Augmentin ?\n\nAugmentin - Is a combination of the antibiotic amoxicillin and the aminopenicillin\u2013\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic of the penicillin family and is used mostly to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.\n\nClavulanate is inactive by itself, but enhances the effects of amoxicillin against a greater range of bacteria, particularly against gram-negative bacteria. While clavulanate is highly effective in this capacity, some bacteria still develop resistance to this drug.\n\nIt is used in the treatment of different kinds of bacterial infections against a broad range of bacteria: Penicillin resistant pneumococcal, Haemophilus and Moraxella (bronchitis or sinusitis), streptococci (tetanus or cellulitis), early Lyme disease, enterobacteria( prostatitis) and Helicobacter pylori (Duodenal Ulcers).\n\nIt may also be used in the treatment of urinary tract infections and the treatment of infectious diseases of the mouth and throat. Augmentin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n\nWhat is Amoxicillin used for?\n\nAmoxicillin is a penicillin-derived broad spectrum antibiotic bactericidal to vast species and is very commonly used to lnfections.\n\nLike all penicillins, amoxicillin acts at the level of the bacterial cell wall. It targets the synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins; inhibits the cross-linking of cell-wall peptides and deactivates autolysins. The effect is accumulation, swelling, and eventually lysis of the cell. Amoxicillin does not by itself have any activity against gram-negative bacteria, but it is frequently combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, given as a combination called Augmentin.

Normally it is designed to reduce the frequency and seriousness of symptoms caused by viral activity but it is not a cure for the infection itself.

Commonly oral herpes is spread through bodily contact such as oral sex,", "Well, kind of. But not basically. Valtrex is a registered brand name for valacyclovir and is owned by GlaxoSmithKline. Valacyclovir is a prodrug of aceclovir, meaning it\u2019s a substance that is metabolized in the body into a different substance. Valacyclovir itself has no antiviral activity. It\u2019s turned into aceclovir, an analog of the herpes virus\u2019s deoxyguanosine triphosphate.\n\nYou may be thinking about switching from the brand name to the generic, but it is important to look for the appropriate version of the antiviral. Aceclovir is not the same as valacyclovir, and it can be dangerous to take the wrong medication.\n\n## How Do They Differ?\n\n### Differences in Composition\n\nAceclovir differs from valacyclovir in two key ways:\n\n- In dose: Valacyclovir is more potent than aceclovir by a factor of two by mole. It needs only half as much of the drug to create the same effect.\n- In dosing schedule: Valtrex is prescribed on a regular, irregular schedule of two pills a day, while valacyclovir is prescribed on a different schedule, up to five pills at a time. Valtrex needs to be taken once a day, whereas people taking valaciclovir need to space the doses at least six hours apart. Valacyclovir comes in several strengths, including 500 mgs to 1 g. Valtrex is available in 500 mg or 1 gram, but two 500 mg tablets add up to a standard dose of Valtrex.\n\n### Differences in Use\n\nValtrex and valacyclovir are used to treat the same conditions, but not in the same dosing schedules. Because of the way it is absorbed in the body, valacyclovir is used less often for herpes virus outbreaks and more often for genital herpes virus infections. Valtrex has the advantage of suppressing the virus.\n\nNeither aceclovir or valacyclovir prevent you from infecting a partner with genital herpes, or other forms", "No. Trademark names are the name of a lab\u2019s product or medication.

You can find the answer to this question in the data that follows.\n\nAs we said in the previous article, the drug you see in the image above is Valtrex. And I can end this issue by saying that yes, Valtrex is certainly the same thing as valacyclovir, but this does not mean that they are identical drugs.\n\nIndeed, these two drugs do have some differences, very similar, but also some distinctive differences.\n\nBelow you will find a comparison between Valtrex and valacyclovir:\n\nName: you can see on the photo at the beginning the name of the drug.\n\nPharmacological class: characteristic of any substance undergoing certain processes in the body.

Naturally, this drug can also be used in cases of genital herpes, as well as oral herpes.\n\nAdverse reactions. If the above list of therapeutic potentials is much higher for valacyclovir, that of side effects is, necessarily, higher for Valtrex. Sometimes, this fact raises the question: \"Is Valtrex safe to use?\"", "Valtrex and valacyclovir are the same drug. The molecule is known on the market as valacyclovir, but when it was released it was approved under the Valtrex brand name (GlaxoSmithKline). While other manufacturers could not legally use the name valacyclovir, Glaxo SmitKline released generic valacyclovir for $6.60 a pill (2010) .

It is a very powerful drug and should only be taken when prescribed by a medical practitioner while undergoing a full blood profile. There are many side effects associated with this drug, including birth defects.\n\nIn fact, the FDA requires all patients to sign a form stating that they have had a negative pregnancy test prior to taking the drug and will be squeezing birth control pills or be abstaining from intercourse while on isotretinoin. The main problem with Accutane is that you must take this medication in order to prevent scarring but can no longer become pregnant for at least a year after stopping the medication. That is why your doctor is so hesitant to prescribe this medication.\n\nAnswered by Dana Nuccitelli", "Yes you can use Accutane safely during pregnancy. In fact we use Accutane to treat women with skin disease during preganancy. We haven't found anything to suggest that the use of Accutane during the early weeks of pregnancy increases the risk of birth defects in babies, and we have definitely shown that accutane is safer than even prednisone during the later stages of pregnancy. That still leaves a question similar to the Aedes mosquito. Accutane works by shutting down the oil glands so that there is less oil for the bacteria to feed on in your open pores which causes the pimples. Accutane is a man made biochemical that does not build resistance to it's mode of action even if there are still traces of the \"dead\" bacteria left in your body. The resistance issue is usually because of a change in the bacteria which is only discovered through laboratory testing when the results of a treatment are bad.

Yes and you will likely develop stretch marks during the same process so that's a topic for your blog \"Should I Still Be Prescribed Accutane?\" and would it affect a baby if I got pregnant?"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5981, "rouge1_r": 0.1739, "rouge1_f1": 0.2695, "rouge2_p": 0.2547, "rouge2_r": 0.0736, "rouge2_f1": 0.1142, "rougel_p": 0.4112, "rougel_r": 0.1196, "rougel_f1": 0.1853, "bleurt": 0.4749, "bert_score_p": 0.8194, "bert_score_r": 0.8557, "bert_score_f1": 0.8371, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.3551, "rouge1_r": 0.2585, "rouge1_f1": 0.2992, "rouge2_p": 0.066, "rouge2_r": 0.0479, "rouge2_f1": 0.0556, "rougel_p": 0.1402, "rougel_r": 0.102, "rougel_f1": 0.1181, "bleurt": 0.2752, "bert_score_p": 0.8325, "bert_score_r": 0.8401, "bert_score_f1": 0.8363, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4206, "rouge1_r": 0.119, "rouge1_f1": 0.1856, "rouge2_p": 0.0094, "rouge2_r": 0.0027, "rouge2_f1": 0.0041, "rougel_p": 0.2056, "rougel_r": 0.0582, "rougel_f1": 0.0907, "bleurt": 0.2164, "bert_score_p": 0.7762, "bert_score_r": 0.8098, "bert_score_f1": 0.7926, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3738, "rouge1_r": 0.1216, "rouge1_f1": 0.1835, "rouge2_p": 0.0189, "rouge2_r": 0.0061, "rouge2_f1": 0.0092, "rougel_p": 0.1776, "rougel_r": 0.0578, "rougel_f1": 0.0872, "bleurt": 0.2481, "bert_score_p": 0.7714, "bert_score_r": 0.8145, "bert_score_f1": 0.7924, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5701, "rouge1_r": 0.2864, "rouge1_f1": 0.3813, "rouge2_p": 0.1698, "rouge2_r": 0.0849, "rouge2_f1": 0.1132, "rougel_p": 0.3084, "rougel_r": 0.1549, "rougel_f1": 0.2062, "bleurt": 0.3314, "bert_score_p": 0.8361, "bert_score_r": 0.8724, "bert_score_f1": 0.8539, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4766, "rouge1_r": 0.2476, "rouge1_f1": 0.3259, "rouge2_p": 0.0755, "rouge2_r": 0.039, "rouge2_f1": 0.0514, "rougel_p": 0.2336, "rougel_r": 0.1214, "rougel_f1": 0.1597, "bleurt": 0.2963, "bert_score_p": 0.8309, "bert_score_r": 0.845, "bert_score_f1": 0.8379, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}]}

Flu symptoms typically appear within seven days after exposure. They may vary but commonly include fever, body ache, cough, chills, and tiredness.\n\nIf you have symptoms of an influenza sickness, you need to take flu test instantly because your doctor won\u2019t diagnose flu in merely by looking at your symptoms. There are many other conditions having same type of symptoms and flu test may be the only tool to confirm your worry.\n\nAt the time of severe cases, positive flu test potentially implies that you have influenza.\n\nThere is a wide number of tests available to diagnose flu, they vary by level of comfort for patient & doctor and turnaround time.\n\n## Where can I get a flu test?\n\nYou can get test for flu from your healthcare provider or do at home Flu tests (rapid flu test kit) also available that don\u2019t require a doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nSome health care providers can provide flu test free of charge, for example, free flu test done by public officials to get an idea of the types of viruses are active in an area.\n\n### Do I Need an Appointment for a Flu Test?\n\nThere is no flu test that is appropriate to get without a doctor\u2019s visit. These flu tests are performed only by doctors or trained personnel in a healthcare setting. Some doctors may be able to do a test when you are in the office for a simple reason, such as a refill for medication.

These 2 terms are synonymous or can be used interchangeably, though today influenza is a popular term used more often than flu. Most of the people are wondering does influenza cause fever or influenza causes nausea, vomiting, cough, loss of appetite which are the symptoms of influenza. More importantly, it\u2019s essential to know what is influenza and what are the best influenza vaccine available today globally.\n\n## Flus Are Influenza Viruses\n\nFlu is one of the serious possible complications of influenza virus and can happen to anyone. But, mostly serious case of flu affects pregnant women and babies. No matter what our age is, we should always be careful about the possible symptoms of influenza A virus or influenza B virus. Simply, we call it as influenza or flu. Major symptoms of influenza are\n\n- Fever with chills and sweating\n- Drastic loss of energy along with body ache( Myalgia).\n- Headache\n- Coughing\n- Diarrhea\n- Sore throat\n- Runny or Stuffy nose\n- Loss of appetite\n\n### How Influenza is Transmitted?\n\nWe all know that a large number of germs exist in the environment and toilets, air, food etc. They are there about everywhere. Some of them are took by air as inhalation. It has been observed that cold areas and cold water temperature have highest possibilities of viral infectious diseases in winter.\n\n## Alcohol in influenza drug- Influenza drug and alcohol\n\nThree major treatments are available for enthusiastic patients which are Tamiflu (known as oseltamivir) as antiviral drug treatment currently in market and various organizations like WHO, CDC have approved it for influenza A or B treatment. But, the discussion about alcohol in influenza medicine and adverse effect of alcohol in influenza drugs is capturing debates in medical communities.\n\nAfter Tamiflu, Xofluza (baloxavir) has been introduced in the medical market. It\u2019s said, in 75% cases, Xofluza eliminated flu virus from human in two days. After that stop gap is played by making antibody like antigen factors, these activated cells work together and", "Normally not , but there are some companies trying to blend the two terms together .\n\nThere are many types of Flu test kits available in the market . Here are few of them\n\n#### Influenza IgM\n\nAs the name suggests , this test detects antibodies ( eg. Influenza specific antibodies) that are produced by the body around week 1/2. As a part of sign and symptoms , the body throws away the viral infections that enter by producing a lot of antibodies, called \u201ccytokines\u201d. However these antibodies dont have time to get sufficient levels , so IgM tests come positive in 2-5 days of the infection and stays positive for just a couple of weeks. Patients whom this test comes positive with is diagnosed with \u2018early illness\u2019. It only varies from Influenza 1 to 6 virus ( A & B ).\n\n#### A/B rapid test kit\n\nAs the name suggests , the main purpose of this kit is to detect which certain kind of Flu virus ( influenza virus ) is behind this respiratory illness. The test kit needs to be incubated at room temperature for at least 15-20 minutes. This test kit resembles pregnancy test type, when screened with urine . There are 2 lines in the indicator, one which is control and another for either Influenza A or B virus in a particular sample.\n\nNow there are a lot of company brands claiming their versions of influenza antigen test kits, for instance, there is \u201cRoche flu afluria\u201d or another is \u201cquery quick flu A/B test\u201d. The major difference is in the target antibodies and the specificity of the detection of the virus.\n\n#### Gold Immunochromatographic antibody test kit\n\nThe mechanism of detection is similar to that of the above discussed conventional flu antigen test kit ( also known as Flu A/B kit ). The only difference with this kit is that a solution containing colloidal gold gets precipitated with colour indication based on the amount of certain antibodies present in the body. The principle behind this test is similar to Influenza A/B, just that it is a much more sensitive form of detection of certain viruses like (H3N2, B, H1N1). It helps in detecting the vir", "Sometimes it is written that flu test costs around 300-400 Rs and the influenza test costs around 2000 Rs. so what is the difference ?\n\nAs we all know \u2018Influenza\u2019 is commonly known as flu, but since the both terms are used so frequently on the internet & press on influenza one should be acquainted with what\u2019s the difference between influenza and flu?\n\nDr. Partha Sarathi Sarkar, a well known endocrinologist from Mumbai, this clarification :\n\n\u201cThe terms itself gives an indication what counts the difference between the two but let me elaborate on this :\n\n\u201cFlu\u201d refers to a group of common viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract (the nose, throat and sinuses). Hundreds of different viruses cause influenza and flu, and, although several affect only humans (human influenza), many others can infect both humans and other vertebrates, such as pigs, birds, horses, whales, dogs, cats and penguins. Influenza is an infection from an influenza A virus, or less commonly from an influenza B virus. The virus then multiplies in the lining of the respiratory tube (bronchi), causing the tissue to change from do not touch anything ? over the next few days. The virus eventually leaves in cough and sometimes in sneeze. Typically, as the virus progresses through one person to the next, it mutates, so an infection in the first person might not hit the next one hard because of those changes. But then a very small shift in the virus \u2013 called by scientists an antigenic or genetic shift \u2013 can change all that.\n\nThis shift occurred in 1918, when the ultra-virulent Spanish flu virus infected almost a third of the world\u2019s population, killing at least 20 million people. It thrived because of mutations that allowed it to easily infect and survive inside the lower respiratory tracts of humans. Most influenza viruses don\u2019t infect or cause significant damage to lower respiratory tract cells. They cause sniffles, nasal congestion, a cough, a sore throat, maybe even a fever, but they rarely progress beyond the upper respiratory tract.\u201d\n\nUpset stomach and diarrhea, especially in children, can also occur with an influ"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4783, "rouge1_r": 0.1741, "rouge1_f1": 0.2553, "rouge2_p": 0.146, "rouge2_r": 0.0529, "rouge2_f1": 0.0777, "rougel_p": 0.2754, "rougel_r": 0.1003, "rougel_f1": 0.147, "bleurt": 0.4764, "bert_score_p": 0.816, "bert_score_r": 0.8447, "bert_score_f1": 0.8301, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4058, "rouge1_r": 0.1411, "rouge1_f1": 0.2093, "rouge2_p": 0.0365, "rouge2_r": 0.0126, "rouge2_f1": 0.0188, "rougel_p": 0.2246, "rougel_r": 0.0781, "rougel_f1": 0.1159, "bleurt": 0.2031, "bert_score_p": 0.7648, "bert_score_r": 0.7862, "bert_score_f1": 0.7753, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5797, "rouge1_r": 0.199, "rouge1_f1": 0.2963, "rouge2_p": 0.1314, "rouge2_r": 0.0449, "rouge2_f1": 0.0669, "rougel_p": 0.3188, "rougel_r": 0.1095, "rougel_f1": 0.163, "bleurt": 0.3574, "bert_score_p": 0.813, "bert_score_r": 0.8533, "bert_score_f1": 0.8326, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4928, "rouge1_r": 0.1983, "rouge1_f1": 0.2827, "rouge2_p": 0.0657, "rouge2_r": 0.0263, "rouge2_f1": 0.0376, "rougel_p": 0.2464, "rougel_r": 0.0991, "rougel_f1": 0.1414, "bleurt": 0.297, "bert_score_p": 0.7998, "bert_score_r": 0.8331, "bert_score_f1": 0.8161, "hallucination": 57.14285714285714, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5145, "rouge1_r": 0.1989, "rouge1_f1": 0.2869, "rouge2_p": 0.0657, "rouge2_r": 0.0253, "rouge2_f1": 0.0365, "rougel_p": 0.2681, "rougel_r": 0.1036, "rougel_f1": 0.1495, "bleurt": 0.2893, "bert_score_p": 0.7935, "bert_score_r": 0.8284, "bert_score_f1": 0.8106, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4783, "rouge1_r": 0.1875, "rouge1_f1": 0.2694, "rouge2_p": 0.0584, "rouge2_r": 0.0228, "rouge2_f1": 0.0328, "rougel_p": 0.2536, "rougel_r": 0.0994, "rougel_f1": 0.1429, "bleurt": 0.3907, "bert_score_p": 0.8047, "bert_score_r": 0.8343, "bert_score_f1": 0.8192, "hallucination": 71.42857142857143, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

Acetaminophen is an analgesic\u2013only.\n\nIs acetaminophen the same as ibuprofen?\n\nNo.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not have any anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nCan I take acetaminophen and ibuprofen at the same time?\n\nYes.  Acetaminophen is considered a benign drug.  It is hard to over-dose and therefore, it is generally safe to take regular Tylenol alongside acetaminophen. At the highest recommended oral dose of 3g of acetaminophen daily, there is about a 3% risk of a mild to moderate overdose, and a 0.25% risk of a serious or life-threatening overdose.  There is also a risk that if you take acetaminophen to excess over time that you will do mild to moderate damage to the liver called acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.\n\nHow Can I tell if a headache is from anxiety?\n\nIf you have had anxiety in the past, you can probably distinguish an anxiety headache from other kinds of headaches.  The only sure-fire way to tell if a headache is of anxiety origin is to do common anxiety and/or headache-provoking activities and see if those incite the headache.  Usually, if a patient is having headaches around deadlines, during times of great stress, or while sitting for long periods, those are headaches of anxiety origin.\n\nWhat are the best painkillers for headaches for muscle tension headaches?\n\nAcetaminophen or ibuprofen. Investigators who study headaches have not shown other over-the-counter painkillers to be better at abating muscle tension headache pain.  There is not enough evidence to support a preference for any one over-the-counter medication.\n\nAre muscle tension headaches different from normal tension headaches or migraines or cluster headaches?\n\nNo. Muscle tension or stress headaches are just a byproduct of stress as a headache.

In Canada, Tylenol is marketed by Procter & Gamble.\n\nHistory\n\nTylenol was first marketed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, under the nameTylenol for headache and body aches in 1955, in tablets and syrup.\n\nIn 1961, Tyler Labs introduced the first extra-strength Tylenol, containing 650 mg of acetaminophen, which became the over-the-counter (OTC) version, used for treatment of stronger headaches.\n\nThe giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) purchased Tyler Labs, and with the help of its marketing and sales people, the brand quickly became the leading OTC pain reliever.\n\nThe new version, unlike aspirin and ibuprofen, was not classified on most of the nations' respective OTC Drug Schedules asa simple analgesic (pain killer); it was instead classified as an antipyretic (fever-reducing or antibiotic agent), a safer classification but one that has subsequently been altered.\n\nIn 1974, the British company A. Pereira became sole owner of Tyler Labs.\n\nIn 1982, the company came under criticism in 1982 when seven people died after ingesting a cyanide-laced version of Tylenol. In response to this confusion, Johnson & Johnson offered refunds to all customers who had purchased Tylenol at that time, and also offered to exchange their Tylenol of that time with another product of its choice.\n\nBecause it was found out that the Tylenol products that were tainted had been re-bottomed, all Tylenol capsules were re-bottomed, to introduce a smaller hole in the bottom of the"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4242, "rouge1_r": 0.0547, "rouge1_f1": 0.0969, "rouge2_p": 0.0938, "rouge2_r": 0.0118, "rouge2_f1": 0.0209, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.043, "rougel_f1": 0.0761, "bleurt": 0.6678, "bert_score_p": 0.7868, "bert_score_r": 0.8484, "bert_score_f1": 0.8165, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.7576, "rouge1_r": 0.0825, "rouge1_f1": 0.1488, "rouge2_p": 0.25, "rouge2_r": 0.0265, "rouge2_f1": 0.0479, "rougel_p": 0.4242, "rougel_r": 0.0462, "rougel_f1": 0.0833, "bleurt": 0.3477, "bert_score_p": 0.8047, "bert_score_r": 0.872, "bert_score_f1": 0.837, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.7879, "rouge1_r": 0.0844, "rouge1_f1": 0.1525, "rouge2_p": 0.2812, "rouge2_r": 0.0293, "rouge2_f1": 0.0531, "rougel_p": 0.4848, "rougel_r": 0.0519, "rougel_f1": 0.0938, "bleurt": 0.3948, "bert_score_p": 0.8098, "bert_score_r": 0.8823, "bert_score_f1": 0.8445, "hallucination": 33.33333333333333, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5455, "rouge1_r": 0.06, "rouge1_f1": 0.1081, "rouge2_p": 0.0938, "rouge2_r": 0.01, "rouge2_f1": 0.0181, "rougel_p": 0.3939, "rougel_r": 0.0433, "rougel_f1": 0.0781, "bleurt": 0.3473, "bert_score_p": 0.7926, "bert_score_r": 0.8549, "bert_score_f1": 0.8225, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.6364, "rouge1_r": 0.0682, "rouge1_f1": 0.1232, "rouge2_p": 0.125, "rouge2_r": 0.013, "rouge2_f1": 0.0236, "rougel_p": 0.4242, "rougel_r": 0.0455, "rougel_f1": 0.0821, "bleurt": 0.3506, "bert_score_p": 0.7926, "bert_score_r": 0.8632, "bert_score_f1": 0.8264, "hallucination": 66.66666666666666, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5152, "rouge1_r": 0.0548, "rouge1_f1": 0.0991, "rouge2_p": 0.0625, "rouge2_r": 0.0065, "rouge2_f1": 0.0117, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.0355, "rougel_f1": 0.0641, "bleurt": 0.2943, "bert_score_p": 0.7848, "bert_score_r": 0.8417, "bert_score_f1": 0.8122, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}]}

Folks think that a tooth can only get hurt when you bite, when it bangs again but should it become painful, there\u2019s something def gas or not throbbing. The body fights the infection with white blood cells, killing them in the process. This results in deadly conditions known as sepsis, pneumonia or crosswise poisoning. A whistling sound called tarinome is emitted by the tooth. Ask your dentist about the characteristics of abscesses.\n\nHowever, the most common scenario in which the bulk of abscesses are formed is in the case of sinusitis, which is simply a collection of pus (\u201cpus\u201d simply meaning pus not bacteria) in the hollow lining of the nasal cavity. This type of sinusitis is known as Rockefelleras\u2019 Sinusitis, which is why abscesses with no pain are more common with the advent of this high tech and more efficient treatment. However, abscesses form during lung infection or in the case of intestinal Para sox, they are called \u201ccrab tubercles\u201d. Crabs can manifest either as abscesses or as spurs. The spur size is usually smaller but may enter the ocular socket and cause mastoid fever.\n\nInside the walls of abscesses, tissues are highly vulnerable to infection. If left untreated, the lining of the abscess will start to swell up due to infection. In most of these cases, the site of the abscess is dry. If there was fluid, pus would be formed to express. Therefore the only way to know that the site of the abscess is dry is by having it diagnosed by a qualified dentist, for you will not know if you should get the site drained or not. So instead of pinpointing of the site for treatment, you should have your dentist check the site and then decide the best treatment of the site.\n\nThis way, you will ensure that the infection has not worsened and the infection is easy to treat. Furthermore the site will no longer cause pain and you can rest assured that you are making a huge difference with regard to speeding up the healing process. Besides surgery, there are other homeopathic and natural means to cure the infection while also fighting", "While each individual is different, and each pain experience will have its own dynamics and timeline, it is not common to have an abscess with no pain. Usually, pain will start immediately or within a few days, and it will intensify over time as the infection spreads and the pressure increases.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the pain might develop later and intensify gradually over time, even with a lack of awareness. This is particularly true if the pain is localized to the skin, since pain under the skin is often a sign of systemic illness (e.g., infection, injury) that can easily be masked by other sensations.\n\nPain in this case can be an unmistakeable sign of a problem.\n\n## What are the 4 signs of an infection?\n\nInfectious syndromes arise when infection with pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi) causes a distinct set of symptoms in the host.\n\nThere are four common signs of an infection:\n\n1. Fever: Fever is one of the most common clinical signs of infection. Fever results from an inflammatory response by the body to the presence of a microbe.\n\nThe entire body reacts to foreign pathogens (bacteria) by increasing the body temperature, increasing the metabolism and producing white blood cells.\n\nThis causes a rise in the body temperature, and the result is a fever. A high body temperature is the body\u2019s response to injury, infection, and inflammation.\n\nNormally, temperature stays within a range of between 98.6 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If the body gets infected, an inflammation process will be generated, and the temperature will go higher.\n\nIn general, when the temperature of the body goes above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, there is a threat of an infection. The higher the body temperature goes, the more severe the infection is.\n\n2. Increased white blood cell count: Usually, the white blood cells in the body are found in the bone marrow. After an infection by a foreign pathogen, increased white blood cell counts can occur in spleen, liver, lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and kidney.\n\nWhite blood cell levels can be measured by blood tests to gauge an infection.\n\n3.

But the pain sadly kept increasing till 3am when I had severe pain under the wisdom tooth. I just called a driver and we went to a private hospital and saw a jackal (igits a position started by DT for the guy who was racially named from VT). The doc in the hospital wrote out 1200/- OTC (for 400/- earlier in another hospital) in an injection and asked not to take it orally but which I did anyways after my second drive to another hospital to take it. However, the same saga problem was back with me again the next day. Somewhat pain reduced after applying OTC ointment on gums for 2 days. Then 2 days back, again elevated, taking 20 tablets of Paracetamol in two days.. after which I kept avoiding the problem.. last night, when I was on checkin, the same problem again.. NO KIDDING but with a lot of assault on the gums and some bleeding along with all the pain.\nHere are the tests reports and charts.

You may feel a characteristic hard sore. It may be red and tender to the touch.\n\nUsually, an abscess is undetectable at the early stage. Most people report an abscess to be painful. However, the first indication of an abscess is swelling, redness, and heat. Sometimes, you may not notice that it begins with a slight redness along with swelling or an area of soreness/tender. As the symptoms continue, pain may develop.\n\n## Why Is There Little or No Pain During the Affected Area?\n\nAround 20 percent of the people do not experience pain at all during the initial stage. Some people who suffer from an abscess report pain at all. It depends on whether the tissues are broken or still clean. Abscesses are quite painful and irritating. Usually, it is also indicated with pain but can occur without any symptoms at all.\n\nDeep-seated abscesses do not hurt because of the thickness of the surrounding tissue.

Your actual Forum is stopped at post 14 or something on page 3, so last few posts of mine is lost.\n\nAccuracy is something you have to appreciate is an investment option, with multiple factors, and not merely yes or no answers.\n\nI didn't carry the message to its fruition, because I had a question back that basically asked, \"why am I the one, out of how many tendinitis sufferers that can't relate and share the common experience\".\n\nAnswer to you is complex as well, and it's not for everyone.\n\nGenerally tendinitis is one of, if not the, most complex condition that starts out with. I go to great lengths to explain risk factors, but no matter for each individual as matters turn complex and astray.\n\nAt genesis, we start with two symptoms. Sure, you can address one area without the other area based on time, method, duration and accessibility of it (control) but that is all VAGUE.\n\nComplex in medicine is not a 4 letter noise words, not synonymous with drug therapy.\n\nComplex is vast array of what symptoms you have and articulate. Symptoms are not your disease, it's a distinguishing mark of it, and signs. Symptoms can and do come with complications and risk factors.\n\nSigns are the pin in the haystack, symptoms the name of the one who witnessed the needle prick.\n\nThe first time I exclusively did direct injections for golfer's elbow, after doing same for my Achilles' 5 years before with accuracy and adaptability that patients seek is when I was 3rd year medical school.\n\nOne of my Achilles' eggs cart elbow strategies involved almost daily mess with this elite track athlete that plays football as well.\n\nI am building and curating an elaborate exercise ecosystem for these knotty, life scarring symptoms that many get too quickly, and often persist naturally for years, without any treatment intervention from others", "For the past two days, I've notice my extension struggles more so than my flexion. My plantar flexion is still as strong as ever yet my big toe hyperextends a bit when I push in my tip toes.\n\nOh and my extensor digitorum tendon is inflamed, yet the same goes for flexor hallucis longus (toe at the bottom) regarding extension strength. So shouldn't that be a sign that the tendinitis is not limited to my tendon, and should strengthening my flexor hallucis brevis (toe at the bottom) help the inflammation.", "I can feel some pretty bad tenderness in the top left corner of the shoulder, and when I can\u2019t move it at all it seems to be in the lateral deltoid.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s less than a month since I stopped doing heavy OHP/presses because of what feels like tendinitis (so anyway 2.5 weeks and 1 week respectively)...\n\nIt\u2019s really stiff and heavily affected by movement. I\u2019m really curious, as I\u2019ve always wondered if there were people whose dominant side shoulder is a bit less dexterous, as this is how I\u2019ve always been, but usually it\u2019s not to the point where it\u2019s barely functional.\n\nThe upper part of it is super annoyingly stiff and painful (Top of the deltoid!), but then slightly more to the front, it\u2019s basically fine.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of different sticking exercises to try and keep it moving, but so far only one that\u2019s had a benefit, and that\u2019s manual distraction of the shoulder (forced spread of forearms with shoulder forwards, so far the only thing that\u2019s definitely felt like it improved extension).\n\nThis kinda sucks, since my weighted dips have been insanely good recently, but they seem to have triggered this (they were basically the only pressing I was doing since OHPs stopped going well just before Christmas).\n\nCurious what anyone thinks, should I continue with it and see if it improves (as in, will it be as painful to move in a month/is it just a tendonitis and should heal up eventually?), or will it damage the tendon? Should I actually just do nothing with that shoulder?", "I have been having a case for about 10 days agonof straightening my right ring finger. If I am gripping something tight, this can trigger stronger pain going into extension. For the upper traps, it only hurts into extension, it does not hurt into flexion at all for that.\nI did a cobra pose both times without noticing any pain. I\u2019ve done cobra many times before due to lower back pain.\nDuring practice today, I noticed in side angle that as i shift forward to extend, there is about 5% pain towards my elbow. This is my first day of practice today.\nIs this normal for tendinitis?", "Contrary to what most people believe, the vast majority of tendon injuries are not the result of overuse, but caused by muscle training (strength, toning, flexibility) or neurologic. Overuse causes either bursitis or scar tissue adhesions, including the tissues in the area around and outside the tendon.\n\nAlso, overuse injuries are not chronic and should heal eventually. I\u2019m having muscle and bursa pain for over 3 years, with no rest I\u2019m on pain killers and on my last week.  I\u2019m only taking 1 pill daily and sometimes 1/2. I have no pain that I can except now, avoid all TV and very little computer\u2026I\u2019m slowly recovering without acupuncture, chiropractic or other treatments. Taking Motrin and/or OTC pain killer is not healthy, get serious and find out what the cause is!\n\nI worked on Cassandra daily for 3 weeks when we ended. Since then, her knee pain is gone, and she can now walk daily without pain.  Highlander was an amazing workout for me, too \u2013 by the end, I was actually able to work out for 5 hours a week and continue meshing and explosive training and now just recovering.\n\nI also worked with another woman who was in ICU and in a wheelchair, and could walk 3 days after my treatments. She was diagnosed with tendonitis, which is very rare. And if you attended the ICU Update, I was the participant whose young child died in her car seat, and recovered with a special eating program and subsequent steroids.\n\nIf you\u2019re experience to tendonitis, see a chiropractor and start an appropriate exercise program!\n\n### Why chiropractic and exercise?\n\nTendonitis is a Nerve Damage condition.\n\nAlthough there are two major components of pain, it is often difficult to separate out these two major symptoms of peripheral nerve damage \u2013 tendonitis.\n\n#### The Why\n\nTo explain why chiropractic and exercise help tendonitis. The issue is that nerve damage occurs when the body cannot refuse to pay attention to a specific pain stimulus. Pain is mostly caused by chemicals that the nervous system uses to communicate in and around the nervous system.

The condition can be due to any medical, genetic, or physical condition. Lipase is quite important and plays a major role in food digestion. It has been researched that 50-70% of lipase in our body is produced by the pancreas. It can be done via many laboratory test methods like your healthcare provider\u2019s manual method, ACTIV-LIPASE or PLASAB DIAL AB drug tests. The PAS method is also very commonly used along with other tests like serology, enzyme tests along with an ELISA test. The total lipase test is considered to be very important so that the provider can investigate more if there is a chance of pancreatic cancer occurring or chronic pancreatitis or other problems. But there can also be acute inflammation taking place in the pancreas, abnormal liver function which in turn will lead to a drop in blood lipase level. There are many symptoms of low lipase which includes stroke, arthritis, decreased white blood cells in the body, loss of mobility in the bone, and many other conditions listed below which if you are experiencing please get proper medical help as soon as possible.\n\nIf not treated on time, it can become serious and can even lead to a fatal situation. If you have a sudden or persistent headache or pain in the chest which is persistent and intense, weakness in the body, venter bleeding, liver pain, and many other symptoms and you feel uneasy, please get proper medical help. Low lipase can be related to cystic fibrosis which usually develops around the age of 1, and the age of cystic fibrosis reduces yearly. Low lipase can also be related to chronic pancreatitis, now chronic pancreatitis is a severe condition and there can be many causes. It can be related to alcoholism or medicines like antibiotics which can cause a decrease or drop in the lipase in your body. Pancreatic cancer is also caused due to low levels in lipase in the test. Symptoms of cystic fibrosis can also be confusion in stool and excessive urination. Let your doctor guide you well while you get a lipase test done. Low levels of lipase", "It is difficult to answer your question as you fail to provide proper information. To begin with it is very important that the lipase level be measured since there is no specific range or normal level all over the world. It should be only compared with the age group that has been studied in that laboratory. It is said that malignant lesions is pancreas also has an inappropriately high level of lipase.

Naproxen can also be used for relieving pain, but it\u2019s also helpful in reducing fever.\n\nContents show\n\n## Usage\n\nWhether you take meloxicam or naproxen solely to relieve pain or for nay other purpose, both of these medicines are efficient. In addition, they may also be used to reduce pain in joint and muscles at low doses. As medicines have their common and unknown uses, you might be wondering what the actual difference between the two.\n\n## Mechanism of Actions\n\nMost of the NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) belong to the class of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors and work to deactivate enzymes, which leads to pain relief. Among them, Meloxicam also belongs to this class of NSAIDs drug. Naproxen, on the other hand, is a weak COX inhibitor, and it works on the inflammatory response by encouraging the expression of C5a and C3a receptors.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn comparison to naproxen, meloxicam is safer because of its avoidance of severe gastrointestinal and cardiovascular conditions. Consuming Naproxen for an extended period with little or no tolerance can worsen your underlying disease. In particular, the COX-2 enzyme seems responsible for bacterial development, and meloxicam is known to avoid bacterial expansion.\n\n## Method of Administration\n\nIn NSAIDs, such as meloxicam and naproxen, the drug is given to patients in oral forms and tablets. This oral route is commonly taken to relieve pain symptoms, if circumstances can be bearable for this purpose. Since we eat tablets and capsules orally, we must make sure to take them in the way that the digestive tract efficiently absorbs them.\n\n## Side Effects\n\nBoth Meloxicam and Naproxen have several side effects, including Guillain Barre, which can cause morbidity and mortality. Severe contrast reactions", "Ultimate Dose has cobbled together a summary of the good and bad aspects of naproxen. The only factor TO take notice, in my opinion, is that meloxicam is ten times stronger than naproxen in some areas. I take naproxen on a regular basis. The one thing which I discover concerning it is that it really works far better when I actually have to use it. If you are a parent that desires to contact some thing off with your child, I recommend making an effort naproxen.\n\nYou have many choices in order to handle arthritic pain and inflammation. Naproxen and Celebrex are 2 popular prescription versions.

The dosage is 0.2 grams naproxen and 200 milligrams of Celebrex, which can be the maximum daily dose included with Celebrex side notes. The evaluations have been done utilizing pain assessments, the majority of which entail scalp scratching. A score underneath 80 was deemed \"stiff bed\" on this particular research.\n\nIn the end, the evaluation showed intervention with 200 milligrams of Celebrex reduced pain nagging in patients suffering from osteoarthritis more effectively compared to naproxen", "## Does naproxen make you gain weight?\n\nThe most common side effects associated with naproxen are gastrointestinal, including gastritis and gastric (stomach) ulcers. It unfortunately can also lead to weight gain, resulting in obesity with time. naproxen rapidly crosses the placental barrier, and may even induce premature labor in some women.\n\nWhat is the strongest pain reliever on the market?\n\nOpioids are generally the strongest pain medications. Narcotic pain relievers include morphine (Kadian, AVINZE, MS Contin, others), oxycodone (Oxycet, Percocet, OxyIR, others), and many others.\n\n### Is there a difference between meloxicam and Naprosyn?\n\nCan meloxicam make you gain weight?\n\nSeveral studies have reported that meloxicam increases the risk of body weight gain (Grove et al., 2017; Smit et al., 2019; 201). Weight gain observed in patients treated with this agent might be related to intervening clinical inclusion criteria rather than a class effect of NSAIDs.\n\n## What is stronger celebrex or naproxen?\n\nWhen comparing the most frequently used NSAIDs in the pain category, naproxen 500 mg RTU was the most rapidly absorbed (median Tmax 1.2 h).

Other less common side effects include headache, dizziness, and fatigue.\n\nWhat are the benefits of mycofenolate?\n\nMycofenolate is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. It is also used to prevent organ rejection in people who have had a transplant. Mycofenolate works by suppressing the immune system, which can help to reduce inflammation and pain.\n\nWhat are the risks of mycofenolate?\n\nThe risks of mycofenolate include an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of cancer, and an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to mycofenolate?\n\nThere are a few alternatives to mycofenolate. One is azathioprine, which is another immunosuppressant. Another is cyclosporine, which is a different type of immunosuppressant.\n\nWhat is the dosage of mycofenolate?\n\nThe dosage of mycofenolate depends on the condition being treated. For lupus, the usual dosage is 1,000-2,000 mg per day. For rheumatoid arthritis, the usual dosage is 1,500-2,000 mg per day.

How have they advanced? Has their use in other areas increased, besides transplant?\n\nWD: Corticosteroids have continued to be used in organ transplant recipients because they are inexpensive and relatively effective, although not the first-line choice for immunosuppression, and because they may be able to help with the complications of organ rejection in transplant patients.\n\nOral prednisone (often 20 mg/day initially and then tapered slowly over the course of about 2 years) in patients with nephritic syndrome is an illustrative example; corticosteroids can temporarily arrest or even reverse renal damage in these patients. Nephrotic syndrome also responds well to moderate doses of oral corticosteroids, which are often tapered over weeks to months. In fact, these two indications for steroids were a major impetus for the development of azathioprine.\n\n> #### Corticosteroids can temporarily arrest or even reverse renal damage in patients with nephritic syndrome.\n\nMA: What about cyclosporine, which was once a \"breakthrough\" immunosuppressive drug?\n\nWD: Cyclos", "The short answer is YES!\n\nMycophenolate, also known as ECMP (\u201cEnviro-Cell Meds\u201d) is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory medication, formulated in a liquid base and packaged into an aerosol canister (similar to an asthma inhaler).

The patients returned to their hospital on the following day-one injection.\n\nIs mycophenolate an immunosuppressant? Yes, it does suppress the immune system. This is especially true for people who are affected with Rheumatoid arthritis, which is a type of lupus that affects joints. Mycophenolate acts by reducing the number of and activities of inflammatory cells that produce joint inflammations. The benefits of taking Mycophenolate are in the short term and can also last up to two years. Most people who take Mycophenolate do not notice immediate effects. However, if an immune response occurs, they are still able to go on and report milder symptoms such as fatigue or depression.\n\nIs Mycophenolate a short-term or a long-term effect? Mycophenolate has been found to be more effective against Rheumatoid arthritis when compared to other types of immunosuppressants, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus nephritis, and chemotherapy. Mycophenolate has been shown to be a safe and effective immunosuppressant alternative to corticosteroids, which has been shown to cause long-term effects. It is also useful for treating people with aplastic anemia.", "Mycofenolate is an immunosuppressant. Mycofenolate is used along with other medicines to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted kidney.\n\nMycofenolate is sometimes used together with a biologic medicine to treat certain side effects caused by non-biologic medicines (such as anakinra or arsenic trioxide).

In normal cells, the cell cycle inhibitor p53 prevents the synthesis of DNA once the threshold number of nuclear divisions has been reached. Many types of cancer cells escape this limitation on cell proliferation: when cancer cells are exposed to drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil, the eliminated inosine monophosphate leads to depression of cellular activity directed against p53. As a consequence, cancer cells continue to multiply, but so do rapidly dividing tissues, hence the side-effect. No impact on the proliferation of normal bone marrow or lymphoid cells.

It is a pink liquid that contains the active ingredient bismuth subsalicylate. This substance forms a protective coating over the lining of the stomach and prevents irritation and acid build-up.\n\nPeptobismol is a similar medicine but contains two additional ingredients: pectin and kaolin. Pectin, a soluble fiber, helps to bind to the diarrheal waste and reduce fluid loss, while kaolin is a clay substance believed to absorb stomach acid and other toxins.\n\n## Origin and History of Pepto Bismol\n\nPepto Bismol was first introduced in the United States in 1957, and it has since become one of the most widely used medications for treating upset stomachs.\n\nSome researchers even believe the drug had a role in the fall of Nazi Germany during World War II. The German army used Pepto Bismol as a treatment for mustard gas, a type of chemical weapon that was commonly used during the war.\n\nThe hypothesis is that the soldiers who took Pepto Bismol had a lower mortality rate than those who did not. However, this claim is not definitive, and it is unclear whether the drug\u2019s potency was its actual cause.\n\nIn addition to those who took the medication, some studies have shown that those who did not take the medication experienced fewer side effects such as shortness of breath or an irregular heartbeat.\n\nThe US and the Soviet Union were investigating the potential of the treatment while conducting initial animal studies during their", "Doctors often prescribe pepto-pez specifically for the very young children. Pepto-pez nausea reliever may contain sugar or sorbitol. Use of the sugar-free pepto-pez in infants can lead to diarrhea due to the sorbitol.

The best bet is to use something else than miconazole because it is not a powder. The only way to make a miconazole powder is to buy liquid miconazole and then convert it to solid form.\n\n## What is Miconazole Powder?\n\nThe good news is that you can use the miconazole powder as a powder and leave it there.

It will happen over a course of a few weeks.\n\nEntropy is a form of energy.

First you can use a liquid that you have to pour a thick layer of powder on because most powder that is not liquid will not be absorbed by the human skin and will evaporate. Then you have to do your hair back and let it dry.\n\nAnother option is to use powder that you can put in a bag and then wash it off. You can make a very fine powder by using acetate paper (or even paper towels) and then tap off the powder while they dry. This method is really good if you are not allergic to gluten.\n\n## Entropy Powder\n\nIf you have fungal webbing (especially if it is on a sun tan or in the middle of your lungs) that is visible, try to use the sealant product that is used to treat toenail fungus. It is called an entropy powder and is similar to a bleach that does not burn the hair and skin but is made from baking powder and silicon mineral oil.\n\nIts name comes from the word entropy \u2013 which is a physical difference between the temperature of freezing and freezing temperatures.", "Click on the above and backlinks for extra information and tips to therapy.\n\nmiconazole powder is actually a preparation similar to it.

But you need to make sure of two other things before we start to prescribe a cream that could help the opposite situation:\n\n1.The general condition of your anal area? A slightly open wound here can harbor harmful bacteria that aid in the development of a urinary tract infection. So if you find that you are passing your urine in a \u201ccloudy fashion\u201d or if there is pain in your abdomen when you void then you may very well need antibiotic treatment for this.\n\n2.Hardness of stool consistency \u2013 Are your bowel motions difficult to pass? Is there blood in your stool? The developed infection can cause a phenomenon referred to as chronic constipation.\n\n3.

This condition is characterized by an excessive production of dilute urine.\n\nIn this article, we look at the causes of clear urine, as well as when to see a doctor.\n\n## Causes\n\nClear urine may be the result of drinking too much water.\n\nClear urine is usually a sign that you are drinking too much water.\n\nWhen you drink too much water, your kidneys are unable to absorb all of it. The excess water is then excreted in your urine.\n\nThis is a normal process. However, if you continue to drink too much water, you may become dehydrated.\n\nDehydration occurs when your body does not have enough water to function properly.\n\nSymptoms of dehydration include:\n\n- dry mouth\n- thirst\n- fatigue\n- dizziness\n- headache\n- dark-colored urine\n\nIf you are dehydrated, you should drink more water.\n\n## Diabetes insipidus\n\nDiabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that is characterized by an excessive production of dilute urine.\n\nThe condition is caused by a lack of the hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin is produced by the pituitary gland and helps to regulate the amount of water in the body.\n\nWhen there is a lack of vasopressin, the kidneys are unable to absorb water. The excess water is then excreted in the urine.\n\nSymptoms of diabetes insipidus include:\n\n- excessive thirst\n- excessive urination\n- fatigue\n- headache\n- dizziness\n\nIf you have diabetes insipidus, you may need to take medication to help regulate the amount of water in your body.\n\n## When to see a doctor\n\nIf you have clear urine, you should see", "... clear urine is a sign of good hydration. occasionally, you may see a trace of blood in your urine, but this isn't urine color. if you notice a discoloration in your urine, you may want to call your doctor to find out why that is happening. keep these things in mind:. clear urine can also happen if you are not drinking enough water. ...\n\nshould you be concerned if your urine is clear? panic in urine clearing: -\n\nwhy is my urine clear and odorless? most people have dark yellow urine. those who drink a lot of water may have clear urine. but there are a few cases when completely clear, odorless, and colorless urine could be a cause for concern. although most of the time it's completely normal, this urine color could indicate that there is a problem in the body.\n\nwhy does my urine look clear and odorless? most people have dark yellow urine. those who drink a lot of water may have clear urine. but there are a few cases when completely clear, odorless, and colorless urine could be a cause for concern. although most of the time it's completely normal, this urine color could indicate that there is a problem in the body. keep these things in mind:\n\nwhat should i do if my urine is clear? clear urine can also happen if you are not drinking enough water. 2.you may have health problems. on the one hand, having clear urine when you only drink a small amount of water a day might not be that worrying. but having totally clear urine in a normal amount of water suggests your body has to be pretty serious.", "\u201cI\u2019ve had two ultrasounds and my second says my kidneys are healthy and I have \u201clittle to no debris in the bladder.\u201d Like it\u2019s not a big worry but also no answers. Do you have a reason why my urine is clear when everyone else says mine has blood sometimes, or why it\u2019s clear or yellow?\u201d\n\nThe Urinary Tract\n\nThe urinary tract includes all structures draining waste (urine) out of the body. The urinary tract includes your kidneys, two tiny tubes called ureters (pronounced as \u201cyou-RE-terz\u201d), bladder, and lastly, the urethra. All of these structures work together to process the blood\u2019s toxins, excrete urine into the bladder, let you store it, and eventually, expel the urine via the urethra.\n\nYour urine can tell us a lot about your general health by its cloudy or transparent nature, its color, and most importantly, its smell. If you are curious about the quality of your urine, NeoMed offers digital UroGen Lab Strips.\n\n## Clear Urine\n\nIf your urine is clear, it's usually not a cause for concern. There are a few reasons why your urine might be clear, which ultimately have to do with the chemical properties of your urine and the composition of the urine itself.\n\n### 1 - You Are Dehydrated\n\nUrine found in the toilet bowl can differ from the urine you see in the glass. However, excessive or insufficient water intake can cause your urine to appear different from its cloudy appearance. As we use our liquid organs to store fluid (i.e., blood vessels, bladder, liver, kidneys), our kidneys will filter waste from our blood and prepare the urine for excretion. If there is excessive water in your system, your kidneys naturally respond by reducing the amount of fluid in your urine originating from your kidneys. You may have noticed this phenomenon when you are in over exposure from excessive sweating, heat, or if you are far from a water source.\n\n### 2 - You Have Drank Too Much Water\n\nOn the flip side, this mostly clear liquid passing through the toilet can be from excess water intake.", "These are the questions you have in mind and we have all the answers to follow in our blog post!\n\nIs clear urine normal?\n\nWhether you're nursing or not, it is normal for urine to appear light yellow or a bit dark yellow. When it comes to babies, the color of their urine can range from clear to light pink to dark yellow. Many factors affect the color and appearance of a child\u2019s urine. It could be due to your child drinking too much water or even not enough.\n\nHere are some fun facts!\n\nBreastfed babies have different colored urine than babies who are being fed formula.\n\nBabies who are only being fed formula tend to have urine that is more clear than anything. Formula-fed babies may also notice more white or yellow coloration in their urine as well. Breastfed babies will often have urine that is a slightly lighter peach-tinged color due to the fat in breast milk. Clear or pinkish-looking urine is also common for babies younger than 6 months old, especially those who are exclusively breastfed. It's worth noting that there is no established medical definition for normal urine color because it varies based on many factors like age, health conditions, genetics, diet, and medications.\n\nRegardless of what your child\u2019s urine looks like, know that you can expect these colors change frequently. It's quite normal for their urine to change from dark yellow to lighter shades of pink or red due to changes in diet and activity levels. If you notice your child has unusual symptoms like vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, fever, or diarrhea along with clear or pinkish-tinted urine, contact your pediatrician right away!\n\nDoes your baby\u2019s urine get darker as the day goes on?\n\nClear and yellow urine are healthy, regardless of when you see it. But if you see dark yellow or orange urine, that could signal a problem. It could mean your child needs to drink more water or is perhaps getting too much sun exposure. Bright yellow or neon-like orange urine may be a sign of dehydration and can indicate that your child\u2019s body is trying to get rid of toxins. If this is the case, talk to your doctor before giving any additional fluids.\n\nIf your baby'", "Clear urine is a sign of good hydration and a healthy urinary tract.\n\nPale Yellow Urine is normal and healthy Urine color ranges from pale yellow to deep amber \u2014 the result of a pigment called urochrome and how diluted or concentrated the urine is.\n\n## The lemon color in urine could indicate that your urine is too concentrated, which can be a sign of dehydration. It can also be a side effect of some medications, including antibiotics.\n\nBlue urine is the most common color people warn about when it comes to medication side effects. This does happen, but in most cases patients are drinking enough fluids so the dark urine is well diluted.\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Bring Your Urea Level Down? The patient\u2019s hospitalization proved relatively uneventful, and by the 14 th day of hospitalization, the patient spontaneously had his catheter removed, without any complications.\n\nHow long does it take for creatinine to come down? So, the levels come down to a normal level of 1.0-1.2 mg/dl when the body filters out some of this creatinine. So the waste is removed from the blood and stored in the form of urine (by kidneys mostly).\n\n### How Long Does It Take For A Urinary Tract Infection To Clear Up Without Antibiotics?\n\nUrinary Tract Infection Treatment Naturally In 3 Days. Usually, an antibiotic medication like ciprofloxacin or nitrofurantoin, etc. is given to treat UTI. These medications can relieve the symptoms in 3 to 5 days....\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Recover From Kidney Infection?\n\nTypically, symptoms from a kidney infection will improve within two to three days of starting antibiotic treatment. Severe bacterial infection around the kidneys may cause urosepsis, or a blood infection. The immune system\u2019s ability to fight this blood infection can then lead to organ failure and death.\n\n### How Long Does It Take For Bacteria To Grow In Your Urine?\n\nBacteria, left unchecked, will grow and permit a delay or even an abnegation in the cure to UTIs, which can result in serious side effects", "Often,  when I ask this question to parents or caregivers they just shrug their shoulders and say they didn\u2019t know.  I remind them,  if there is a specific pattern \u2013 such as only having clear urine in the morning, late evening,  when running a fever,  or after a face wash with tea tree oil,  then it should always be shared with their child\u2019s doctor.\n\nIf  the child is drinking less fluids,  then the amount of moisture in a urine sample would be reduced making it look more colorless.  Up to six hours of fluid deprivation is reasonable in a child,  as your health care provider may tell you to do before a urine collection.   This is done to focus more samples on the volume produced by the child,  not the color/specific gravity.\n\nA urine color spectrum could be the following from light to dark yellow:\n\n- Clear (Orange): Dehydrated or pregnant only.\n- Light Yellow (Orange): Light color, as well as consistent with being well hydrated.

If the nausea is related to a definable problem, such as a mild ulcer or an early stress reaction, there is a fairly long list of medications that will solve it temporarily. If the nausea is classically defined, there are drugs available for short term relief.

Detox centers have a medical staff (ranging from doctors, to nurses, to nurses aides, and counselors). They not only have the appropriate tools and medications for vomiting and detox, but are also equipped to help the individual in the process of detoxification. They may offer a medically monitored detox or they may use methadone or suboxone \u2013 to assist with a detox. This type of setting is very safe and monitored \u2013 and has a much better success rate than trying to detox at home. Whatever route one chooses in detoxifying, be sure that one has medical supervision to decrease any negative side effects.\n\nDeciding whether or not to take his meds, or jump into suboxone or methadone are personal decisions and may have implications for one\u2019s personal recovery. These must be decided upon by the individual.\n\nI am glad that he started a program and a sponsor. And I am happy that they are encouraging this movement towards abstinence. Keeping quiet and compliant, and reaching out for help, are both huge successes on the road to recovery. I hope that he is personally not adverse to the help! There is no foolproof guarantee in much of this. The higher power part of it, always spins our heads. But we can help by listening, caring, and supporting.

In that sense then, the disease is not threatening to your life.\n\nSome of these very joyous resolutions have included spontaneous and often complete recovery and remissions. In most of my earlier IBC patients, the condition was only recognized and the diagnosis was made after reviewing a surgical pathology of what looked like a harmless benign swelling of the breast tissue.\n\nOn the other hand, I learned that a routine screening for breast cancer is very important in the cases where the name IBC is synonymous with a serious undifferentiated tumor.\n\nBy the way, also, I would like you to consider the fact that because of the slow herB2/neu effect and the therapies that I mentioned above, in all likelihood your IBC may exhibit biological properties that are decidedly different from other cancer types.\n\nThis may even dictate a very conservative, conservative trial and even a surgical approach. Therefore you should consider whether MTZ is a wise option for you to choose to begin with.\n\nRemember, although most of IBC patients have a good prognosis, there is always the fear of recurrence or metastatic spread. Especially in the worst affected group where symptoms become intractably progressive, these patients most often fare much worse than the general public.\n\nWith time, the symptoms of your disease can be fully controlled, but I would still suggest that you monitor yourself carefully.

The body's sweat glands are mostly located under the arms, in the groin and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

You must first ask your doctor whether he or she has had any amount of training in treating hyperhidrosis. Ask how many patients similar to you he or she has treated. Since hyperhidrosis is not generally taught in the medical schools, you must ask if they read, learned and/or studied about it. Urge for a more thorough and appropriate evaluation. Your best bet is to seek help from a medical doctor who specializes in conditions just like yours and not for a doctor who dabbles in treatments like these only as part of an overall skin treatment practice.\n\nI now have anxiety when I use my hands in public.\n\nAskDocWeb: AMiDARc\u2122 is the simple and safe way to finally regain that control over your hyperhidrosis.

My adolescent years were horrendous as a result of it. I was 24 when I finally had my 7 life Bigger Surgeries and hence am the ugly scarred Titanic! Calling out having deformed my face Nose My Genitals & private parts as a result of 3 modern day scientists blasphemous treatments. Which all subsequently implications lead to HIV Aids and Cancer in the near future. Anyway. Something you\u2019ll never have to deal with in your sweet teenage years is teenage acne. I\u2019ve never dealt with it. Thankfully. And millions of other people never deal with it. But if you happen to be one of the millions that gets teenage acne it can be smile thing. It can get so unbearable- both mentally and physically that you can not bear to do anything other than hide away. Something which isn\u2019t always easy to do when you\u2019re at school or college. Of course this does not happen to everyone. Most people with teenage acne manage to hide it. Or cover it up really well. But sometimes it can be just too much to bear. And understandably so- teenage acne can be just as damaging as adult acne I\u2019ve been a hunter, a forager, a rocker, and an outcast.

{"Question": "Is there anything I can do about feeling like Im going to pass out?", "Free_form_answer": "Fainting is a brief loss of consciousness caused by a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. In healthy individuals, fainting is possible for various reasons, like not eating or drinking enough, standing for long periods, standing up too quickly, or experiencing emotional stress. Identifying the triggers that cause this sensation can help reduce the frequency of fainting episodes. Additionally, when you feel like you might faint, certain techniques can improve the blood flow to your brain and prevent you from fainting. These include lying down if possible, sitting and placing your head between your knees, squeezing your thighs together, and crossing your legs and arms. Fainting can also be caused by serious health issues related to the heart and brain.

What should Im be looking out for?\n\nThere are a variety of things that can cause palpitations and or \u2018passing out\u2019 sensations. These include; stress, dehydration, lack of food, side effects to medication etc.\n\nSeeing your GP is the first step in trying to work out what is going on, as a certain type of test or medication may need to be carried out.\n\nHowever, do also mention how you feel to anyone because they might have had a similar experience but it is important that you seek professional advice/help too\n\nHi, As Palpitations are quite common want to check when you are experiencing them? Is it when standing up suddenly from sitting etc. If  these are typical of standing up from sitting, then its possible you have \u2018orthostatic\u2019 hypotension and will require blood pressure cuffs on both arms. Take pulse laying first and then once stood for a few minutes. If your pulse is much higher when stood up your lying pulses are slower than usual \u2013 meaning you have normal resting pulses, though can recover better standing up due to help of gravity, then you have \u2018orthostatic\u2019 hypotension. Both arms blood pressure cuffs then needed.\n\nHi Sweetheart,\n\nThe first thing I would suggest is that you see your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy. Have some blood tests done and tell him your symptoms. You may have blood pressure problems, hypoglycemia, or your body may just need to rest. The palpitations will go away when your heart is healthy again. Some women feel this way after their baby is weaned, since the high levels of estrogen fluctuate.\n\nAnother option is to make an appointment with your ob/gyn in case of pregnancy, to check your thyroid for hypothyroidism.\n\nPerhaps a vitamin-mineral and B-complex could help you. I suggest stopping alcohol, tea, coffee and caffiene, anything that might have a diuretic effect. Supplement with magnesium to calm your nerves.\n\nLet me know if you want more info and suggestions.\n\nViewing 11 posts - 1 through 11 (of 1", "Yeah, Im still experiencing nausea. Was it a 2?

These are very big churches and have very large events like this Easter breakfast with 100s of tables for the congregants to enjoy the breakfast.\n\nSome professional designers are putting their final touches and do brisk business everytime they come to decorate events at the church. \u201cWe provide our services free of charge to assist the church in the mission field\u201d. \u201cWe are simply doing what we see the bible documenting pastors and disciples to doing, \u201chow save a soul by moving in and deliverance the city from satanic activities.\u201d One of the elderly man sitting among the group is Seth; he\u2019s usually quite jovial, but today is not one of those days, returning a wistful smile to him he says; \u201cI am very sad today because among the people who are busy decorating the arena is my daughter; having grown fond of churches.

How does it work?\n\nThe bronchitis kit is a special machine that enables a friend to pipe air into the airway outside the tracheostomy tube. It is inserted through the tracheostomy tube and has a connector that is attached to the non-rebreather mask or oxygen tubing.\n\nAnother method is to put the marked end of the breathing tube from a resuscitation bag over the removed outer cannula of the tracheostomy tube, and blow into the end of the resuscitation bag to give the boy an inhalation followed by a short exhalation. Connection of the oxygen tubing to a ventilation machine or resuscitator can provide pressure support and clear condensation from the inner cannula of the tracheostomy tube, which can't be done with the bronchitis kit.\n\nFreeman Zaloudek, RRT, is an outreach program manager with Respiratory Care Online."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4643, "rouge1_r": 0.1552, "rouge1_f1": 0.2327, "rouge2_p": 0.1351, "rouge2_r": 0.0449, "rouge2_f1": 0.0674, "rougel_p": 0.3125, "rougel_r": 0.1045, "rougel_f1": 0.1566, "bleurt": 0.4591, "bert_score_p": 0.8111, "bert_score_r": 0.8057, "bert_score_f1": 0.8084, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4375, "rouge1_r": 0.1601, "rouge1_f1": 0.2344, "rouge2_p": 0.0541, "rouge2_r": 0.0197, "rouge2_f1": 0.0288, "rougel_p": 0.2232, "rougel_r": 0.0817, "rougel_f1": 0.1196, "bleurt": 0.2682, "bert_score_p": 0.8073, "bert_score_r": 0.8132, "bert_score_f1": 0.8102, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 40.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4643, "rouge1_r": 0.1576, "rouge1_f1": 0.2353, "rouge2_p": 0.1081, "rouge2_r": 0.0365, "rouge2_f1": 0.0545, "rougel_p": 0.2589, "rougel_r": 0.0879, "rougel_f1": 0.1312, "bleurt": 0.2876, "bert_score_p": 0.8168, "bert_score_r": 0.8304, "bert_score_f1": 0.8235, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3661, "rouge1_r": 0.1117, "rouge1_f1": 0.1712, "rouge2_p": 0.045, "rouge2_r": 0.0137, "rouge2_f1": 0.021, "rougel_p": 0.2321, "rougel_r": 0.0708, "rougel_f1": 0.1086, "bleurt": 0.2849, "bert_score_p": 0.8014, "bert_score_r": 0.8075, "bert_score_f1": 0.8044, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3839, "rouge1_r": 0.1162, "rouge1_f1": 0.1784, "rouge2_p": 0.0721, "rouge2_r": 0.0217, "rouge2_f1": 0.0333, "rougel_p": 0.2411, "rougel_r": 0.073, "rougel_f1": 0.112, "bleurt": 0.3313, "bert_score_p": 0.8095, "bert_score_r": 0.8107, "bert_score_f1": 0.8101, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 80.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.2857, "rouge1_r": 0.1693, "rouge1_f1": 0.2126, "rouge2_p": 0.027, "rouge2_r": 0.016, "rouge2_f1": 0.0201, "rougel_p": 0.1696, "rougel_r": 0.1005, "rougel_f1": 0.1262, "bleurt": 0.2789, "bert_score_p": 0.8068, "bert_score_r": 0.8115, "bert_score_f1": 0.8092, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 80.0}]}

With so many products on the market today that claim to help stop hair loss or to regrow one\u2019s hair, it is sometimes hard to know what each product should be used for and how best to use it.  It\u2019s really great that you have done your homework and have at least an inkling as to how these products work, but before you get started, I believe you should have a clear understanding of what minoxidil is, as well as the proper way to use it, on the hair loss result you can expect.\n\nWhat is Minoxidil?\n\nNamed after a prescription medication made to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, minoxidil was discovered by the company Upjohn that was performing animal studies on the systemic effects of the drug, and noticing a side effect of the hair growth.  Upjohn determined that the hair growth side effect was not from the chemical properties that they thought it was, so they stopped further development. 9 years later, OFI Labs acquired the formula and started developing a topical solution for hair regrowth.  Minoxidil is in the class of drugs known as Prostaglandin Matriptase Inhibitors (PMI) and was approved by the FDA in 1988 to stop progressive hair loss in men and women through topical application.\n\nHow to use:\n\nMinoxidil is available over the counter so you can apply anywhere and everywhere.  However, users should be very careful when applying to the scalp.  Do not super-saturate the hair with excessive hair loss, there is some indication that this may alter the results.  Do not apply to areas that weren\u2019t covered by hair prior to treatment.  For example, this means there is no benefit to try and use Minoxidil to fill in bald spots.  If you have a bald spot, you\u2019ll need to be using a product that helps what has caused the hair loss vs trying to regrow whatever you\u2019ve lost to the condition.  Minoxidil should be applied with a dropper twice a day, once in the morning and again at night before going to bed.  Apply the solution to the scalp on the areas where hair loss has occurred.  Rub Minoxidil thoroughly in the scalp after application.  Rubbing will ensure the liquid is washed into the skin", "And last time i would notice i would get pain in my whole head towards my neck. Get similar side effects (Scalp reddening, burning, itching) also get similar problems like dizziness/nausea/headache, or skin rash/hives, throat, old sag. Lot of people I know who use minoxidil gel experience it. Sometimes you even let out a squeal of surprise! Of course, there were other examples, too: one question, however, contradicts Popovic. Am I supposed to stop using minoxidil? I cant do it every day. I have a prescription for MK.\n\n## Irritation of the scalp\n\n### My suggestions\n\n- Congratulations to the person who shared that they\u2019ve been using it for 6 years and got them to stop. My advice to you is to apply a coat a day for a few months then stop. Thats usually what happens for people who get these problems. Try doing a few months with less application then try stopping all applications for a few months. Give your hair a few months, if not a few years off before trying another round perhaps. Best of luck!\n\n### The suggestions of others\n\n- And any hope of continued success? If what is indicated is rather simple in application, you may learn while trying to incorporate this new idea into your routine, of course it is not worth losing. But seeing the advantages for health and beauty, considering that the benefits will be from two points of view, health and beauty, I think it\u2019s worth a try.\n\n##### Laxman Undru (drug delivery)\n- Some are dangerous, like tapentadol. You can find how dangerous they are looking at the famous sildenafil citrate (Viagra). And so sometimes they can be dangerous, maybe not as side-effects but let\u2019s say an addiction - that is why they all have long periods of discontinuation, dapoxetine \u2026 well dapoxetine you\u2019s name it ;). Not saying that minoxidil is not safe. It\u2019s mostly well tolerated \u2026", "Hello! I am trying to use minoxidil regularly in the hope of regrowing my hair, but i can't use it at the moment due to a cold.\n\nI'm from Scotland - so the winter is pretty cold here!\n\nSo, my question is, during the cold weather - if i am still using the lotion every day EVEN while i have a cold, is there anything in particular that i should be looking out for?\n\nIt won't be a congestive cold or anything like that, and i could actually apply it right now but i would much prefer to wait until afterwards since my head feels hot and my face is pretty red. So, tomorrow i will definitely apply the lotion once my head has calmed down and everything returned to normal.\n\nShould i expect any changes in this process due to the cold?", "Hello, I\u2019m EP Phenomenal aka Egyptomac I reply to all messages please send me your requests using this platform I am here just to help you be great , believe that you will be ok..... Thanks\nWhat is minoxidil best for?\n- ## Related Questions\n\nWhat is minoxidil best for?\nMarked by: Amit Bhatt\n\nTo quote the Mayo Clinic: \" Minoxidil, a topical liquid applied directly to the scalp, was approved for treating hair loss in men in the 1980s. Minoxidil was originally developed as a high-blood-pressure drug before medication manufacturers discovered it made some users' hair grow. It comes as a liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice daily. While it's not known exactly how minoxidil works, the drug seems to help enlarge hair follicles, making it possible for them to produce more hair. The foam is eliminated as a tablet in the United States and is available in liquid form only. \"To see if a medication might be causing hair loss, doctors usually will do a 2-month test where you stop all medications and supplements that might be causing hair loss. Stopping minoxidil is our first choice for a trial. If stopped, any regrown hair will be kept for an additional 3 months, then drops. It takes 6 months to see results, though, since the hair grows in cycles. \" Minoxidil usually works best when used as directed. Without continued use, the hair growth achieved by minoxidil once stops, and the new regrown hair can be kept, advises the Mayo Clinic. Maximize the results of minoxidil by keeping the following facts in mind: Patience: It can take up to six months of use before you see significant hair regrowth. Consistency: Apply once or twice a day, as directed. Compliance: You must use minoxidil every day in order to grow hair and maintain any results. Remember: Any results obtained with minoxidil will stop if you stop taking it. That growth that you wanted to renew must be renewed.

Our editors answer your questions about this annoying fungus.\n\nContents of this article:\n\nTinea capitis (also known as \u201ccommon bald spot infection\u201d, ring worm of the scalp and fungal scalp infection) is a health condition that tends to affect the scalp. It is associated with skin infections, infections of the nail, or any of the body\u2019s mucous membranes. It is, indeed, quite a common fungal infection, particularly in children.\n\nIn the United States, tinea capitis affects up to 252,000 individuals, who tend to be children. And 70% of them have black Afro-textured hair. Tinea capitis is often associated with poor health, underdeveloped immune system, poor hygiene, and presence of pyrene. The infection typically starts on the scalp\u2019s superficial layers and spreads to the other parts of the body should a patient leave it unattended to.\n\nAlthough it is, indeed, easy to treat this condition, it is not easily manageable and prone to recurring in two years if left untreated. In this guide to tinea capitis, we will try to address all the questions currently being asked about this health condition.\n\n## Is tinea capitis contagious?\n\nFor starters, tinea capitis is a contagious condition, and the organisms involved in its causation can get transmitted from one patient to another. It\u2019s important to take the necessary prevention guidelines to keep yourself safe from it. Tinea capitis spread rapidly and can be transferred on contact, via air and shared objects. Common areas such as towels, combs, barbers shops, hotels, hair salons, shared bedrooms and the likes are notorious for having huge numbers of the infectious fungal organisms.\n\nWithout any measure on mistakes of hygiene, there is a probability of an infected person catching this fungal infection and so spreading it to another equally unknowing person.\n\n## Can you catch tinea capitis? Do you get tinea capitis from shaving your head?\n\nYES, it is possible to get tinea capitis from someone who is infected with this condition. If, for example, you visit a barber shop whose is poorly ventilated, poorly cleaned,", "Yes. If your child has tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp), he or she can pass it to others. People with tinea capitis can give the fungus to others. People with tinea corporis can give the fungus to others if they have broken skin on the affected area. People with tinea malaram can give a resistant form of the fungus to others. They can scrape this fungus off of their toenails and give it to other people if someone touches them. Tinea curris can be passed from anywhere there is skin exchange. So to answer the question yes this tinea capitis is contagious.\n\nHow long can this ringworm disease spread before someone gets sick?\nRingworm can be spread if someone touches an infected person\u2019s skin or shares personal belongings such as a comb or brush, headphones, washcloth, grooming supplies, or a hat. People may get infected once they get an open wound or crack and in people who have:\n\n- Damaged skin\n- Eczema\n- Poor hygiene\n- Those who handle or are around animals such as dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, and hamsters may be more likely to develop ringworm.\n\nWhat treatments are available for tinea capitis?\nThis fungal infection can be a tough one to treat. First there\u2019s the tricky diagnosis and then there\u2019s the tricky treatment. Grisefotuvin ointment, fluconazole and even Iv amphotericin B have been tried to treat this rash but the treatment doesn\u2019t end there! Note that in the treatment of tinea capitis, the parents may have to administer oral antifungal medication to and apply shampoo containing a fungicide (or antifungal medicine) to all the family members that might be infected. So is this scalp infection really worth it? Well there are many on the internet that would probably say no.\n\nIs there an alternative treatment for tinea capitis that doesn\u2019t involve using the medications like griseofulvin ointment and fluconazole? Homeopathy as a treatment for ringworm offers much benefit.\n\nThere are currently 3 main ways that homeopathic substances can be used in a person\u2019s treatment.\n\nHomeopathic remedies", "What do you need to know about toenail fungus?

At an outpatient facility in Detroit, Michigan, I was having lunch with a few medical school classmates. One of them remarked that Alzheimer?s was misdiagnosed about 30 percent of the time.\n\nWhen I expressed surprise, my classmate replied that he had read it on the Internet.\n\nOn his smartphone, he tried to show me the web page, which spelled \"Alzheimer's.\" The spelling error made me think he was not being truthful about reading it there.\n\nDo you think that doctors and other intelligent people read on the Internet before they talk to each other?\n\nI offer the ALS impersonation. In the last few years, workshops have taught parents to recognize ALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. (ALS was the disease made famous by ALS advocate, Dr. Stephen Hawking and, more recently, a video featuring actor Sean Diddy Combs.)\n\nWorkshop participants were encouraged to tell others to talk to their doctors about ALS. If their physicians failed to cite ALS as a diagnosis, the workshop trainers said the patients' physicians had made a grave error.\n\nThe workshop participants were shown ALS videos produced by small organizations and were told these videos were made by clinicians and researchers. I worked at a major ALS center for 20 years and I can tell you that the workshops are not made or hosted by reputable ALS centers doing clinical trials or conducting research.\n\n## A Veteran's Perspective\n\nDr. Siegal, if one has psoriasis and arthritis, what should be done regarding the use of Remicade?

Is it an irritation or a skin problem? It doesn't bother me a lot, but I would like to know its", "How is tinea capitis different from shingles? Can tinea capitis infection be spread through contact between people and animals? Yes! Tinea capitis is caused by a fungus that lives on the skin. Shingles is a viral infection that affects adults. Pets can spread tinea if they are infected with the fungus.\n\nIs tinea capitis (head ringworm) contagious? Tinea capitis (head ringworm) is contagious if you come in contact with the fungus that causes it. The ringworm fungus can be found on animals like cats. People can also be infected with the fungus if they come in contact with others who are infected. Tinea capitis is not usually caused by a fungus that lives on human skin.\n\nIs ringworm contagious to dogs? Tinea capitis is a disease that affects the scalp of dogs. It is caused by a fungus that can live on humans, too. Ringworm is transferred to dogs through contact with humans who have ringworm. Ringworm is not a disease that can be given to dogs through contact with cats.\n\nWhat fungus causes monilial ringworm? Dermatophytosis is caused by different species of fungi. The most common species are Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, and Microsporum gypseum. T. violaceum is less common cause of ringworm and T. tonsurans can cause a more severe form of ringworm.", "In the past, dermatologists were once removed from the field of infectious disease, not needing to worry about epidemics disasters and becoming inured to any nerve damage, blepharitis.

I have been taking allergy", "I\u2019ve had strep throat twice in the past for years. After the strep goes away, the virus comes back later and I have post viral pharyngitis. With strep there are tons of white & yellow mucus blocks. With the viral, they are slimey white mucus blocks that come back later and later after strep has cleared up. When does viral pharyngitis end? I can\u2019t lie as this is getting on my nerves. It\u2019s been going on for so long. My pierce ears ring really loud in my head all the time. Blows. I\u2019m a singer and I work as one in Thailand. I\u2019m here in Uk to study (music college). My throat is getting worse as I\u2019m losing sleep. I\u2019m hungry too. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIn fact, having had strep throat before makes you more prone to viral pharyngitis. It\u2019s not due to an allergy, but it\u2019s bacterial infection. Initially it starts with a rhinovirus infection, i.e cold. I think you get the virus. Then, it progresses to a strep infection, i.e pharyngitis or tonsillitis. In post viral pharyngitis, tough, the white sticky secretions are due to viral kind of secretions which tend to pick up infections from the bacteria in the mouth and get really gnarly at times. Then, you tend to get more problems with the ear or noise etc. To get rid of this, make sure you gargle like hell. Either do the salt water gargles or betadine gargles at least 3 times a day. The oral intake of medicine helps minimise the aspect of pharyngitis. Antibiotics are also necessary. I would say that with mononucleosis which is a somatic viral infection, it may take up to 10 days and even longer for the patient to improve, so you know you have to be persistent about it. Sometimes there are drugs like steroids that can brighten the pharyngitis. But sometimes they also go into the ear and other secretions and cause local inflammation making it tougher to get over the entire episode.\n\nI\u2019m allergic to a lactose intolerant food and", "I am a 49 year-old male and I have had repeated episodes of viral pharyngitis which clear up with a steroid treatment. I thought that this was all being caused by allergies. A couple of months ago my doctor performed a strep test on me and it came back positive - I got an antibiotic prescription. The doctor gave me the typical broad-spectrum antibiotic (one of the clarythromicyns). The usual antibiotic bottles have 10 tablets in it and I took all of them. To my surprise, the sore throat actually got worse and I could not clear it even with all of the other extra support I was doing - including sore throat gargle and topical steroid. I had a sore throat for over 5 weeks! Do you have any explanation why this would happen with viral pharyngitis?\n\nViral pharyngitis is the cause of most throat infections. It is not an allergy related thing. The fact that antivirals, antibiotics and corticosteroids are sometimes helpful suggest that they are beneficial only for a subpopulation of patients since it typically has no substantial effect on viral pharyngitis which is inherently self-limited. Although viral infection produces specific antibiotics followed by early appearing specific symptoms such as - blinding headache, fever, flulike symptoms, muscle pain etc. there fore it is difficult to diagnose the viral pharyngitis.\n\nIt is important for patients to avoid taking an antibiotic unless directed to do so by their physician. A physician would not prescribe antibiotics to treat a viral infection since it does no help to patient but can have life threatening side effects such as allergic reactions, CI (clotting of inflammatory mediators) and the overgrowth of drug resistant gram postitive (sensitive to antibiotics) enteric bacteria.People should also avoid using antibacterial and antiviral related products such as vinegar/honey etc and not take matters into their own hands and risk serous consequences.\n\n#### QUESTION\n\nPanic attacks are repeated attacks of fear that can last for several minutes. See Answer\n\nwith the option of cough syrup etc for relieving cough and sore throat.", "The answer is both yes and no. When allergies are attributed to food that we tend to eat daily, then it\u2019s a matter of intolerance/sensitivity to that food. Serve these foods to a normal person in a huge quantity and the person will still have no reaction. On the other hand, serve the same food to person suffering from allergy and that person will start having dental problems, viral pharyngitis, asthma, food intolerance, hay fever, bad sinuses etc. We shall look at this in some depth below by considering the case of Sea food allergies.\n\nSeafood Allergy is an allergic reaction to foods from aquatic species.

However, let\u2019s see how this can happen, and how such a reaction could manifest itself. Fact is, many things can play a role to trigger reactions to allergens that precipitate a viral infection and that would express itself in your throat. In This Article, we shall describe these different cause of allergic Viral Pharyngitis and how you can treat this.\n\n## Is Viral Pharyngitis An Allergy Thing? Pharyngitis Allergy In Technically Terms\n\nWe have many different kinds of viruses that can cause pharyngitis, most of them really common and are almost ubiquitous and can actually cause numerous different conditions. That\u2019s why it may be a little bit confusing sometimes to distinguish one type of pharyngitis from another. We also have a lot of reactions that happen in the body. And in some instances, one virus may cause a number of reactions, and a standard, run of the mill virus will express itself completely differently in one person than it will from another person. That\u2019s also why it can be a little confusing, and you can see lots, lots of different symptoms that people develop.\n\nHowever, there are certain kinds of reactions that you can witness that may suggest the viral pharyngitis is caused or at least triggered or caused by an allergy reaction. But the key fact here is that a virus may play its role precipitating an allergy. Whatever the origin of that virus, it could be either a biological organism in itself, whether that is a wet virus, like the flu, or flus, various other pneumonia, whatever it may be there is also something that can be a trigger for an allergic-type reaction.\n\nAnd one of the immediate reactions that a body can have is actually a gastrointestinal reaction, it\u2019s a digestive reaction. Now, that may not be recognizable as a problem because when you start reacting to something and then it works its way down to the digestive system.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever taken any kind of medication, just basically any kind of medicine or supplement to start off with, after a couple of days of consumption, many times your gastrointestinal glove may react by stopping you from absorbing as much of the ingredients. So, instead of running it through your gastro", "We\u2019re hearing that a lot right now with new allergies and this time of year. If your child has the pharyngitis with allergies, they probably will not have the fever.\n\nViral pharyngitis is something that could include sore throats with a fever. This would be a fever of over 100 degrees. It can also have rapid onset of the pharyngitis with the sore throat.\n\nCharacteristics may include; swelling at the back of the throat and pain when swallowing food; pain when swallowing water. The fever doesn\u2019t stay up for long, and there would be some swelling in your neck, which is part of lymph nodes or glands. They usually do swell up when there\u2019s an infection going on. You might have some yellowish drainage on your tonsils, although if that\u2019s a bright yellow, that\u2019s a hint of a strep culture. That means it could be a bacterial component to the pharyngitis.\n\nStrep would detect it with a test to determine if it\u2019s strep throat. If you\u2019ve been with somebody recently with the pharyngitis, ideally, you could get a strep test if the fever went away fairly quickly after the onset, if it lasted for only three or four days.\n\nPharyngitis with allergies usually specifically had no fever if it was allergies. Your ear sensitivity might be much more of a problem. You might really wonder what is the issue? It might be some swelling or a little more fluid behind your eardrum. This might cause some pressure and weird sensations in your ear. Usually, this doesn\u2019t happen with the pharyngitis with allergies, but sometimes, it happens.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know if you have this allergy or cold symptoms since you would handle them differently."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.1892, "rouge1_r": 0.0169, "rouge1_f1": 0.031, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1892, "rougel_r": 0.0169, "rougel_f1": 0.031, "bleurt": 0.5677, "bert_score_p": 0.7339, "bert_score_r": 0.8139, "bert_score_f1": 0.7718, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4865, "rouge1_r": 0.0503, "rouge1_f1": 0.0911, "rouge2_p": 0.1111, "rouge2_r": 0.0112, "rouge2_f1": 0.0204, "rougel_p": 0.3514, "rougel_r": 0.0363, "rougel_f1": 0.0658, "bleurt": 0.2947, "bert_score_p": 0.7867, "bert_score_r": 0.8486, "bert_score_f1": 0.8165, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.3784, "rouge1_r": 0.0408, "rouge1_f1": 0.0737, "rouge2_p": 0.0556, "rouge2_r": 0.0058, "rouge2_f1": 0.0106, "rougel_p": 0.2973, "rougel_r": 0.0321, "rougel_f1": 0.0579, "bleurt": 0.3129, "bert_score_p": 0.7863, "bert_score_r": 0.8421, "bert_score_f1": 0.8132, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5676, "rouge1_r": 0.0616, "rouge1_f1": 0.1111, "rouge2_p": 0.1389, "rouge2_r": 0.0147, "rouge2_f1": 0.0266, "rougel_p": 0.4054, "rougel_r": 0.044, "rougel_f1": 0.0794, "bleurt": 0.2732, "bert_score_p": 0.7791, "bert_score_r": 0.8543, "bert_score_f1": 0.815, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5946, "rouge1_r": 0.0563, "rouge1_f1": 0.1028, "rouge2_p": 0.1389, "rouge2_r": 0.0128, "rouge2_f1": 0.0235, "rougel_p": 0.4324, "rougel_r": 0.0409, "rougel_f1": 0.0748, "bleurt": 0.3495, "bert_score_p": 0.7878, "bert_score_r": 0.8613, "bert_score_f1": 0.8229, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4054, "rouge1_r": 0.0512, "rouge1_f1": 0.0909, "rouge2_p": 0.0278, "rouge2_r": 0.0034, "rouge2_f1": 0.0061, "rougel_p": 0.2432, "rougel_r": 0.0307, "rougel_f1": 0.0545, "bleurt": 0.2942, "bert_score_p": 0.7971, "bert_score_r": 0.8459, "bert_score_f1": 0.8207, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0}]}

When they get close enough to your cat\u2019s anal region, he\u2019ll do what he can to get rid of them \u2013 by scratching his/her rear and trying to rid the parasites from this way.\n\nTapeworm symptoms will leave your cat looking as though he is stuck in an unwinnable battle with his back end.  This is easily diagnosed as a dog worm.  It is really just step one, however.  There are indeed", "It depends on the cat, on you, on the tapeworm, and on the type of worm.\n\n## First, What Is A Tapeworm?\n\nAn adult tapeworm is a flat, white, or cream colored ribbon-like thread made up of identical segments called proglottids. A typical tapeworm is anywhere from an inch to 25 feet (26- 80m) long.\n\nAnimals can get tapeworms from rarely used rodents (such as chipmunks and field mice) who get the tapeworm from eating cow and sheep feces. The tapeworm gets into the rodent and attaches to the intestinal lining of the rodent. At some point, the tapeworm's head pops out of the rodent's anus and drops its eggs around the rodent's anus which allow the tapeworm to mature when the rodent eats them. Once the rodent eats the eggs, the tapeworm is able to invade the rodent's intestines and reproduce.\n\nYou should know that humans who have been infected with a tapeworm like this are described as a living \"host\" for the parasite. Humans ingest eggs or fleas or consumption the raw meat of an infected animal.\n\nCats tend to ingest the eggs from fleas or consumption of infected rodents or other animals.\n\n## Common Tapeworm Infections for Cats\n\nRodents, insects, or hunting animals are the most common sources of tapeworm infection for cats.\n\nTaenia taeniaformis: Most commonly found in domestic cats and occasionally dogs who eat lizards, frogs, chickens, or rabbits.\n\nDipylidium caninum: Fleas (primarily cat fleas) are an intermediate host in this infection and require adult tapeworms to reproduce. This is perhaps the most common parasite in U.S. cats and dogs and the most recommended one to be viewed when suspicious of a tapeworm in an animal. Flea eggs, larvae, and pupa are infected by the worm and ingested by cats and dogs when they either eat insects and in rare occasions, lick themselves clean after scratching.\n\nEchinococcus granulosus", "When we pet owners love our animals as much as we do, we are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure our pets are safe and healthy. I remember at our practice, there was often a joke among the veterinarians when we got asked \u201cCould my cat give humans worms?\u201d even though we all well knew the answer.\n\nBefore we get to answering this question, it is important to state that tapeworms are NOT common in cats, and using dewormers on a healthy cat based on fear that your cat may have worms is a waste of time and money. The cats that actually may benefit from deworming are cats that go outside or \u201cat-risk\u201d cats (learn more about at-risk cats). This vagueness in answering the question is because if you didn\u2019t know before reading this, you may not know whether your cat qualifies as an at-risk cat (unless your cat has an open-door policy).\n\nWhen a \u201cnormal\u201d cat (usually meaning an indoor-only cat) goes to the veterinarian and is examined and tested, and we see no indication that this cat is harboring tapeworms. They, therefore, do not receive a deworming for several reasons:\n\n1. It is not a routine practice to deworm and a veterinarian won\u2019t if they do not see tapeworms\n\n2. There would be no reason to de-worm unless there is parasitic activity (note that this ruling out of tapeworms in normal cats of the past doesn\u2019t mean all of them are restarting this today - just evaluate the clinical process and risks of deworming to find out more about how to prevent and treat tapeworms (this is done by a veterinarian))\n\n3. Deworming is not an instant cure. Most dewormers are going to kill tapeworms within 3-4 weeks of ingestion. This means if this cat is seen for need of deworming one day (even if they have intestinal problems) the deworming may not solve the tapeworm problem they have (note for healthy cats that have no other intestinal issues, tapeworms are not capable of causing health problems)\n\n4. It will cost money for medications and testing procedures, and money is wasted when medic", "Tapeworms can infect both people and pets. In people the worm can be seen in the feces or cause intestinal disturbances. In people, they can cause a gnawing hunger, nausea, and a reduction in appetite if the tapeworm invades the lining of the stomach. By the time you actually spot the worms, you will have already been infected for some time. If the worm eggs find their way to the small intestines, you may develop a vitamin B12 deficiency, which will show itself with seizures.\n\n## Can you tell if my cat has parasites?\n\nIn pets the tapeworm is seen as a worm that is white and moves around. Tapeworms sometimes clip themselves onto the fur of the animal, and they are barely seen, but when their eggs hatch, they infest mice or other rodents and the cat comes into contact with the eggs while \u201chunting\u201d the mouse. The eggs are then released and the cat may re-infect himself.\n\nThis is a good reason to have your cat dewormed, as well as keeping your cat indoors. Never withhold wormer from a cat that has spent any time outside or free-roaming outdoors in the open.", "I understand cats can get tapeworms from eating mice and rats, but what about lice or fleas?

Not all patients with PCOS have trouble with pregnancies; however, this problem might increase with increasing PCOS severity, as the incidence of female factor infertility, poor egg quality with recurrent miscarriages and complications during pregnancy (excessive nausea and vomiting, gestational diabetes, hypertension and preeclampsia, accelerated intrauterine growth of the fetus) rise.\n\nThese complications are significantly associated with the severity of the syndrome, therefore, the timing and dosage of medications, hormonal treatments, intrauterine transformations \u2013 injections and embryo transfer \u2013 will depend on the levels of male hormones, insulin resistant and LH. Since the syndrome is a multi-factorial disease, the response to treatments will vary over time as part of the initial response.

Although going through perimenopause, women with PCOS are 8 times more likely to become pregnant than those without it. And although pregnancies in these cases tend to be more complicated, this has nothing to do with the risk of having a child, if not the risk of metabolic changes during the nine months of pregnancy. It has recently been discovered that inflammation plays a key role in the onset of PCOS and increases the level of resistance to insulin in women who are prediabetic. In these cases, a reduction in this inflammation can increase the effect of insulin and therefore have a beneficial effect on their metabolism.\n\nA study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that obese male partners were less likely to be fertilized by obese PCOS women in an in vitro fertilization.%.

(I know, because you\u2019ve already posted a comment on it, rejoicing in the fact yours is the 1,000th fan).\n\nI\u2019m delighted to know how much interest there is in this topic, because it\u2019s important: Preventing gastrointestinal distress is the right way to prevent potential long-term problems.\n\nHere are answers to some important questions that are on the tips of Debbie\u2019s and others like her fingertips:\n\nQ: What are NSAIDs?\n\nA: Non\u00adsteroidal anti\u00adinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Motrin^{\u00ae} and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter (OTC) in drugstores, supermarkets, convenience stores, and discount stores. It\u2019s possible to buy these drugs when you are out shopping for groceries.\n\nAt the same time \u2013 we\u2019re in an age of the informed consumer. I would like you to approach your OTC pain management with a foundation in facts to avoid the ache of unintentional decisions about treating yourself (for, let\u2019s face it, nobody ever thinks they\u2019re using anything they shouldn\u2019t be).\n\nNSAIDs work by reducing inflammation (swelling and pain). They also are used to relieve mild to moderate pain, PMS symptoms, and fever.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of long-term use of NSAIDs?\n\nA: Before long, Debbie is going to knock out a pretty severe headache. Regardless of whether this is a tension headache or a migraine, she\u2019ll reach for a pill or two of OTC pain reliever dependent on the high likelihood that she won\u2019t have a recurrence of the headache within 12 hours \u2013 which may well be the extent of her thinking.\n\nWhile a headache is a headache (nobody\u2019s knocking Motrin^{\u00ae} use for self-limiting pain such as the average headache, unless your allergic to it). Taking a high dose of Motrin^{\u00ae} is like throwing a lifeline to calcium in the bloodstream.

I am telling you about things you've may read about here and there, but you may not have put together quite yet. The next time you are feeling crippling pain with optic symptoms, or tingling in your arms or fingers.... stop right there. Headache is secretly a very serious disease! This is why you want to be sure to notice it's more than just a headache!\n\nHeadache has many different descriptors. This is because it is so very uncomfortable and affects everyone differently. If you can, I encourage you to pinpoint your personal descriptors, because yes, your migraine might be different than your best friend's. Here's...", "yeah, it hurts!

She is a professional who will go over with you what kind of regimen\u2014or what products from the pharmacy or the store you assist with! That maintain that how much to build it happen not.\n\nI drink one glass of water every morning as I was told it cleanses the body from the night and gets you going. Is this true?\n\nNothing wrong with drinking water, but fasting for several hours allows the stomach to get into the routine of preparing for the day\u2019s food intake. It is called a \u201cfast\u201d because if you did not eat for 8-12 hours, \u2018legitimate fasting\u2019 begins to lose weight and clear the system.The stomach is not intended to function throughout the day with an ever-resting activity of eating; indeed, it led to overeating and overweight, which negatively comes on the gum. Personally, I eat my last portion at dinner until next morning, 8 to 10 hours, then eat breakfast. The only caveat is that I discarded 6 ounces of water before I ate breakfast.\n\nSleep Promotion\n\nStribild is a four-in-one malone drug that is for the treatment of the HIV in adults.Each of the four ingredients inhibits HIV in a different way.

Try a tablespoon of walnut oil daily for 4 weeks and see how you feel. You probably won\u2019t even need the NSAIDS anymore if it helps. You can also brew Walnut oil into a tea if you don\u2019t like swallowing these oils, although you won\u2019t get as many benefits as you would from actually swallowing the oil.\nAnd you can definitely flavor sour still beer with walnut!", "It also is beneficial to your body to to take chate- Relief for shoulder and back aches I sprained my back last year and have been on real pain killers.

Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, headache, and difficulty walking.\n\nHow is vestibular neuritis diagnosed?\n\nVestibular neuritis is typically diagnosed based on a physical examination and a review of the patient\u2019s medical history. Imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, may also be used to rule out other conditions.\n\nWhat is the treatment for vestibular neuritis?\n\nTreatment for vestibular neuritis typically involves rest, medication to reduce inflammation, and physical therapy to help improve balance and coordination. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the damaged nerve.\n\nHow long does vestibular neuritis last?\n\nThe duration of vestibular neuritis can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual\u2019s response to treatment. In most cases, symptoms improve within a few weeks, but it may take several months for the condition to fully resolve.\n\nCan vestibular neuritis be prevented?\n\nThere is no known way to prevent vestibular neuritis, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding activities that may increase the risk of infection, such as contact sports, may help reduce the risk of developing the condition.", "Vestibulitis is a condition in which the nerves between the inner part of the ear and the brain swell, become inflamed, and do not function normally.

Moreover, if you carry on the Commons bacteria, this can also cause an infection of the vestibule trim.\n\nCholesteatoma! The vestibulitter condition is usually not contagious. Symptoms of vestibuleter syndrome usually develop over several days. Symptoms usually include Dizziness, loss Of balance, and ringing In the ears.", "In this type of inner ear problem balance and dizziness suddenly develops, due to a usually short-term lack of sufficient function of the vestibular nerve.\n\nThere are several possible causes for sudden unilateral vestibular loss including: labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, Meniere\u2019s disease, migraine-associated vertigo, benign paroxysmal vertigo, stroke, vascular insufficiency, cerebrovascular disease, multiple sclerosis and unilateral hearing loss.\n\nCauses of sudden unilateral vestibular loss:\n\n1) Viral labyrinthitis\nThe vestibular system is very sensitive to viral labyrinthitis, due to the fact that the vestibular nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also called the vestibulocochlear nerve) is a part of the CNS. Most other cranial nerve innervations are made through branching and have a small entry point into the central area of the brain. Only cranial nerve VIII intertwines with the particular segment of the brain involved with the function of balance.\n\nThe labyrinth is the delicate tube-shaped system of the inner ear. This system is divided into an external membranous labyrinth and an internal membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth lies within the hard inner ear bony labyrinth or 3500-year-old Brodmann area 47. Brodmann area 47 is found in the medial surface of the temporal lobe just anterior to Heschl\u2019s gyrus, which is the posterior most point of the auditory cortex. The vestibule and the three semicircular canals of each internal labyrinth are the membranous structural entities. The function of the vestibule and semicircular canals* are continuous movements; those of the hearing mechanism (cochlea) are stepwise changes. The semicircular canals are the lateral, posterior, and superior canals. The lateral semicircular canal is designed to sense oscillating or whirling movements, the posterior canal senses pitch, and the superior canal senses vertical movements. When functioning properly, the three semicircular canals of the labyrinth communicate through the utricle and saccule with the help of the canal ampull", "Well, let me tell u, like all over the world, rarely described to a perfect description, so let me tell u. jaha hasti hai, kya hoti hai campaign is gone........so i will give you my idea of it and will ask u about yours in ur replies.\n\nAccording to the inner circle of neurology, the vestibular neuritis is a disease in which the pathways that are responsible to giving the external cues inside to the brain in the form of motion are interrupted or there is some defect in the functioning of those pathways, which is probably due to a viral infection prostrating in the sensory or motor cranial nerve 8.\n\nIt presents with headache, vertigo, tinnitus, nausea, and vomiting, mainly towards the inner direction of the space, the direction of the ear affected and eyes are drifting in that direction, too. Nystagmus is seen.\n\nUpon visualizing, changes are seen from right to left.\n\nAnatomy:\n\nThe Eighth or the vestibular cranial nerve innervates the ears and gives sensory signals related to spatial orientation which go to the main pathway formed by the pons, medulla, and lobe.\n\nThese pathways are the peripheral, vestibulo-cochlear neural pathways, Central pathways, and cortical pathways.\n\nIn each of these pathways, lying upwards and downwards Eighth cranial nerve accentuates the specific areas, too.\n\nIn a simple way, you can also think it as a system of conveyance only, sending commands of our head motions in the form of electro- influence through Eighth cranial nerve to the lobe to be processed accordingly. Hearing also comes under this.\n\nA combined action of all of the above diagnoses the head comes to its correct posture.\n\nWe all know that anything that works need nourishment, i guess.\n\nIt seems that if this nourishment is not provided properly, it can be due to suppression downward, i wish to decipher.\n\nPostural muscle exercises or neck manipulation can decrease the effects of down regulation in the form of providing this nourishment at a faster rate.\n\nWhat i observed in my conditions is, concerning about the insulted cranial nerve", "Theresa Wilson, OTR, chief operating officer with Activities Unlimited provides some information on the vestibular system.\n\nWhat Does the Vestibular System Do?\n\nThe vestibular system is located in the inner ear to perform balancing and positioning tasks. This system is continually sending information to command centers within the brain. The space occupied by the vestibular system (inner ear canals) consists of three connection points (utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals).\n\nHow Does Vestibular Neuritis Occur?\n\nThe vestibular system is connected to nerve endings that exit from the inner ear and travel to the brain per the eighth cranial nerve. Vestibular neuritis occurs when nerve endings fail to send correlated information to the brain, causing vestibular symptoms which include vertigo.\n\nSymptoms of Vestibular Neuritis\n\nVertigo is the most common symptom of vestibular neuritis - a loss of equilibrium. Vertigo can cause dizziness and unsteadiness. Sometimes vertigo will move left to right or up and down causing movements and subjective experiences of nausea. Vestibular neuritis can cause hearing issues in the most acute stages. It is strongly recommended that individuals with acute vertigo problems visit healthcare professionals for hearing testing.\n\nVestibular therapy includes the use of different types of physical therapy to treat the patient diagnosed with vestibular neuritis. The therapy used to treat vestibular neuritis includes:\n\n1. Activities of daily living \u2013 ADL's that improve ability of a patient to regain balance.\n2. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises \u2013 Activities designed to challenge the vestibular system to promote balance, stability and equilibrium.\n3. Vestibular retraining exercises \u2013 The therapist may provide the diagonal eye scanning exercises designed to assist the brain centers to receive signals that cause nausea, spinning of the room or cone.\n4. Ballonal stability exercises \u2013 Heavy weighted activities allowing you to lean and control your flexibility in an item without losing your balance.\n5. ISO Bench stability exercises \u2013 These patient-assisted exercises are designed to allow you to lean and note your imbalance during postural changes.\n6.

Because the good guys don\u2019t thrive in that type of alien, unNatural pH.\n\nAnd, if you\u2019ve ever wondered why mom says no is perfect antibacterial pump soap \u2026 well pH level isn\u2019t the only thing antibacterial soap kills. Things like sperm thrive in this environment too. That\u2019s why you probably read the labels on your lube and hear your OB say, only use water-based lube. He prob warned you of tje dangers of oil, silicone or other types of lube. We shall say he\u2019s talking about the probiotics but I\u2019ll touch on this later.", "Before we discuss the facts on this issue, here are two basic facts:\n\nWhile it is possible to exaggerate the bacterial-yeast correlation, it is quite clear that it does exist. In other words, while not directly connecting the two, research shows that yeast overgrowth is often triggered by an imbalance in something else. Yeast love bacteria so it is only natural that they would like to live in areas where they find out outlying in large quantities and, likewise, where the bacteria live nearby. The bacterial-yeast correlation does not always apply to Candidiasis, many other yeast infections, including toxemia, and some genetic diseases can be environmental; but there are genetic variations of the yeast that make them more open to an imbalance.\n\nSo, bactrim and tween 80 are both a thymol. Both are bacterial steroids (staining), one is an end product of the bacterium and the other is an impackage of the host cell (cell wall). The yeast is just an environmental sludge. By simply removing most of the obvious impurities from the environment, the yeast will go away.\n\nThere is one important fact to keep in mind: The levels of impurities are only slightly changed after a thymol is metabolized by the yeast.\n\nBasically, the first part of the problem is the yeast, the other part is the bacterial steroids that cause the yeast.\n\nThe best way to handle the bacterial steroids is to remove the yeast: If you remove the host cell, the bacterial steroid will also go away. The effects of the bacterial impurities will also go away.\n\nAs long as the host cell is intact the yeast are more open to infection and the bacterial steroids will show up again in your body. The treatment of the diseased body by removing the host cell is similar to vaccination.\n\nThis is not necessarily an easy task. Some forms of cancer can be caused by steroids affecting the growth of the cells and taking them out won\u2019t in itself cure cancer or other newborn health problems. It is a matter of concentration. The cure is very difficult to achieve because one may have immune system problems, a weakened immune system, a faulty diet, a poor immune system, stress or emotional problems, lack of exercise and allergies.

Q: Here's some basic info about bactrim before we get to your questions: If I have to take Bactrim, how is it likely to affect my digestive system and how to treat bloating and/or constipation? If you're sensitive to bactrim, it can cause you to have a lot of digestive problems, including yeast infections. The symptoms of a yeast infection are itchiness, redness or formation of small white or yellow blisters. Has anyone experienced this? Don\u2019t eat too much of it.\n\n- If you are taking bactrim for something else such as otitis media, acute pyelonephritis, or chronic prostatitis symptoms relating to STI these will be addressed with the appropriate drug.\n- Greenjuice360 - we recommend that you seek medical advice from professionals who know about yeast infections better than we do.\n- If your body can\u2019t handle a yeast infection of oral sex.\n- Let\u2019s delve a little deeper into how bactrim can affect your yeast levels.\n\nPenicillin can also be used to treat yeast infections. However, it does make the heart cheerful. Suffice it to say that if yeast happens to your body, make sure to clarify your diet problems with a proper nutritionist before you start eating Bactrim. Bactrim ds is available in 90, 500 or 1500 mg capsules or as a suspension. If you have high sugar sensitivity, sometimes, and after a time, you can become less sensitive.\n\n> As with all illnesses, herbal tinctures can treat a yeast infection, but they can have a slow effect.\n\n## Is Bactrim Safe to Use While", "Writing in BMC.

Mange mites are found throughout the world.They are terribly persistent parasites; once established, the mites defend the mite\"s premises with great ferocity.Mites are often covered with a waxy protective coating. In the case of mites, they grow on the dog and reproduce only once they find a host.The disease in managing mites with medication is often a combination of otitis itself and a secondary bacterial or yeast infection that results from scratching and minor wound healing in the infected ear.Anytime a dog has an ear problem (pain, swelling or other signs) treatment against those parasites is rational, most experts", "Health Education England Library and Knowledge Service Working in partnership to change Outer Ear Infection.\nIf so, can it cause infection much much FASTER if the LD fluid threaded from skin has an opening in the ear that\u2019s a bone or water entry way.

It does NOT act to suppress the vomiting, but it works at the back of the brain, where vomiting is suppressed, and thus it may lessen or eliminate the nausea and vomiting. so maybe you need to experiment a little bit to find a correct dosage for you. it should be ok, somehow, but I\u2019m no doctor.\n\nAlso, sertraline is not unusual for causing nausea as a side effect.

Since they\u2019re used to treat very different conditions, the way the drugs make it into your body and how they\u2019re processed is independent of one anothers. One could have an effect on the other but that effect is going to be unpredictable.

As the condition is both diagnosed by a very limited range of PCR, cultures & prostate massage exams (in the case of DRE examination) it can only be definitively diagnosed once the cause is found. Sometimes the cause can be established by looking at lifestyle, diet, addressing possible IBS or the fact that someone suffers from Parkinsons for example but all too often prostatitis still cannot be formally diagnosed.\n\nIn 20+ years of research and experience what has become particularly frustrating to me is how little really has changed in the tests to identify the causative agent, such as an infection; such as an inflammatory response to foods or pollutants etc, or a combination of both. There just has not been that big step forward to the next level of technology that a reasonable person could expect, given our reputation for technical excellence.\n\nTo continue with the tests I have already mentioned a candle stick test ie establish that someone suffers from IBS will perhaps find inflammation of the intestinal tract, which could be Acid Reflux and eventually finds the links to the possibility of NCMP (non cystic fibrosis mucus plug) which could be the cause of your prostatitis. DRE again wont absolve you that you have the right diagnosis, unless the doctor does a prostate massage prostate exam while observing the prostate and noting the texture, colour and feeling of the prostate.  All too often this is absent from the diagnostics list, following after a moderate to long period of time so be sure to ask your doctor to provide this test as part of a clinical diagnostic process.\n\nWhat about examining your semen to see if there are any abnormalities in your semen? Why did no one do this first? For one this would exclude the possibility of inflammation being 1 suspect and the colours of your semen may include images that indicate a genetic infection.

This is a very good piece of information. Results from RRP and BGF surgery were typically found to be subaverage [204], and it is due to that reason why this method is usually combined with another treatment such as alpha-blockers and TAU a little while after conventional therapy, seen as the vast majority of patients are unstable to contain their urinary urgency a few weeks after surgery [22]. Both research and anecdotal evidence indicate many men continue to struggle with prostatitis long after these treatments, but nows theres good news. This study suggests that in our patients with severe interstitial cystitis symptoms and difficult-to-treat uropathogens documented at cystoscopic evaluation, treating these uropathogens definitively can result in significant improvement in their symptoms and as a consequence may change our patients care, potentially postponing or preventing future surgical intervention. Once the infected Catheter is removed then there should be no spreading of organisms anywhere in the body. Drug resistance has also been documented.

He has been given a prescription for antibiotics and anti andelsics. For the time being he is taking Doxycycline. He was given a testosterone regulation therapy which he is supposed to take over a year. Does anyone have any experience with long term antibiotics? How long did you take them for, did they help? I have spoken to my Son in Law, who is a UK registered doctor and he has advised going for low intensity DNIF and so I have sent my husband to see a reputable Urologist. Is this a good option? Is there any other treatment beside antibiotics? Also, is there any treatment involving vitamins, which he can take instead of the steroids prescribed. We are also looking to solve the reason why he is suffering with this particular illness. Can it be diet related? How can the chronic ulcer on the bladder with the rectum can be healed? He did have many blood tests examations but the prostatitis prognosis developed very rapidly after an inguinal hernia on both sides was done once yewars back and in the following week he got a spontaneous fever. So now my husband has no choice but to have surgery. The all have recommended surgery and we were going to wait to have it done in Manchester, Salford. We paid to have a a second opinion in Germany Hospital but unfortunately we were informed by my son in law that the prostate op is very costly and that they would have to do further tests back here in order to estimate how much the op would approve. So I am sorry to say we are still getting help. Anyway, we are very determined to help him better and are open for any advice!

It is important to note that, in most instances, replication of the virus in the human host begins in the skin and spreads throughout the body via infected blood. As such, many of the skin manifestations are likely due to this early replication of the virus, as well as the late invasion of the virus into the skin capillaries. This ailment usually occurs one to three months after initial infection.\n\nPity fact: People of color and those with fairer skin are at a higher risk of the WNV infection.

However, this itch does not exist. Ringworm is actually a fungal impingement also referred to as tinea corporis. Athlete\u2019s foot and various other skin eruptions that result from a fungal infection also fall under this common category. There have been rare instances reported of the sufferer getting slight itching but these are extremely rare cases.\n\n## How Does Ringworm Spread?\n\nRingworm generally happens when spores are transmitted via contact. The spores generally move to the upper dermis where they lock in, settle, and spread. Transmission can take place via skin-to-skin contact, indirect contact or contact with various inanimate objects. While ringworm affects both children and adults, children are mostly affected via indirect contact and animals. Also, pet owners, who are constantly exposed to pets like cats and dogs, are constantly prone to ringworm infections.\n\n### The Dense Coverage Helps Spread the Infection\n\nWhile the infection has been linked to pets, specifically goats and sheep, the rash can easily reoccur from covering each other with clothing and other apparel but there are instances where heavy and dense covering has been noted to worsen the infection. This can be either clothing, bed linen, artificial cloth, or any other manmade covering. Fun Fact; No actual Worm Causes Ringworm!\n\n## How to Cure Ringworm\n\nRingworm can be cured either through lots of self care or with medication, based on the infection. Your pharmacist can direct you towards the proper products for buying or your doctor can prescribe topical creams. But there are many ways to naturally cure ringworm and the following list will help you to learn how to naturally cure ringworm by yourself.\n\n### 1. Salt and Turmeric to Treat Ringworm Infection\n\nWhen using turmeric to treat ringworm, you should always mix it with salt and use just a tiny bit of water to make a fine paste. A turmeric paste, which is usually a shade of orange, can be used to cover up the infection. This amazing paste will not only ease the symptoms of the fungus but it will dry it out, preventing it from spreading", "### So ringworm doesnt itch?\n\nQUESTION:\n\nMy husband has treatment resistant ringworm, just on his head.

When it looks like ringworm on the scalp, it usually is, but it does sometimes not look like typical ringworm.\n\nI would try and get a referral to a dermatologist and the scalp would be something a dermatologist should check to make sure its ringworm before they start treatment.

Ringworm is infectious and is spread from animal to animal contact (especially when they play with infected toys), sharing and contaminated water and food bowls, bedding, and even from the groomer if they do not clean brushes properly. Ringworm is a persistent treatment. To remove this stubborn ringworm, you will need to clip the hair on the infected area and start with topical treatment.", "No, ringworm is a fungal infection. Remember it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something that really crawls on your skin. And when it does, it does not crawls all over, but a portion of it. Be concerned if the rash you thought to be dermatitis or acne, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gets healed in a week or two from now. Itching will certainly develop if not attended right away. As the infection progresses, the rash will take different shapes. It will start as a circular, red rash, but may show other changes as it grows and spreads. It could be dry and crusty, or weepy, moist, and even scaly. The rings maybe raised with patches of broken skin and bleeding. Ringworm has actually came a long way since the medieval times, what with the poor hygiene and widespread of it among the poor people which they believed that the ringworm infection was caused by parasites living on the body and under the fingernails. The best cure for ringworm was then depilation, which was crust and remove it with human feces; followed by cutting the hair near the infection and spitting in it. True? Well, with advances in treatment today, fungal infections may still be considered world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most common illness. In the US, 11\u00c2  million \u00e2\u0080\u0093 60 million people have it annually. Rashes due to ringworm affecting the body, groin, scalp, and athlete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot are common, most especially those affecting the feet. This is why, itchy, scaly, inflamed skin is most often associated with ringworm, although red bumps, crusting and ring like shapes take place.\n\n#### Author: foongling\n\nHelp us improve.

When I was lifting 2 maybe 3 years ago my issues were a lack of motivation and focus, but with a 12-week course of adderall farc-2 before and after my fits, along with the pre workout naproxen pills, my motivation and focus was there and I was able to do my work outs pretty well. I was also able to dodge the drug tests I was required to do to maintain my status at the base I worked at to at least get one class up. But even with the drugs I rapidly I gained all the weight I had lost in the span of a few weeks. I believed at the time was the fastest results I had ever had with exercise. I'm not a big fan of drugs, especially with the risks involved with masking, and being positive on a pset or hair test, so I decided to work WITH drugs to magnify my gains but without the blood A to B.

It is a common microorganism. It was not considered to be very dangerous. However, this strain of C-diff was potent enough to eradicate or kill the strain that protected the human colon and bowel area from other diseases. Before it became very widespread, only those who had been hospitalized were at a risk. The patients who came in with this medical complaint were given antibiotics to knock out these Clostridium difficile bacteria. The more potent the antibiotics were, the more they were able to destroy the good bacteria, resulting in more C-diff infections.\n\nIf you have not recently taken an antibiotic, then it is possible that inconsistent laxatives, changes in diet or your environment could have caused this small strain of the C-diff infection.

This is also pretty common amongst these C-diff episode victims. It is not uncommon for the patient to gradually become thin as he or she loses all weight. Some may not see any abdominal area or fever.\n\nC-diff can also cause a swollen infection on the skin. The major symptoms of this condition on the outside of your skin can look much worse than all the other symptoms combined.

Other treatments include ligation, surgical removal, and laser eradication.\n\nPREVENTING GENITAL WARTS\n\nBecause an infected person may not know that\nthey are infected, genital herpes is spread easily through sexual activity. If you know that your partner has herpes,\nwearing a condom can reduce the risk of infection.\nHowever, you can also get herpes from skin-to-skin\ncontact instead of just from penis-to-vagina or\nanal sex.\n\nPREVENTING HPV\n\nThere are two vaccines in use today to help prevent\nHPV. Both vaccines currently require three shots and\nshould be given to young girls between the ages of\n11-13.

Genital warts often appear in the pubic areas, rectum, vulva, penis, cervix, labia and thighs, or in the pink areas inside the mouth, lips and tongue.\n\nGenital warts are contagious and spread through sexual contact.\n\nThe HPV warts usually look different than the common wart in cauliflower shape with small spots.  If you know the herpes virus you may know the lesions, they are often small, vesicular and pestacular and may look like a know case of eczema.   The HPV warts are usually elevated and have a different texture altogether.\n\nGenital warts are very quite small and can be very difficult to spot.  Extensive clinical examinations may be required, but not always.  Your doctor may suggest some form of testing such as cytology and visualisation.  Many healthcare providers will diagnose genital warts the first time around, but if you feel that your partner or workplace is harbouring a HPV strain, it is important to have it look into and treated.\n\n> It is important to have a facial examination in the area of the threat and your sexual partners for any kind of warts or rashes on the face.

In fact, only a handful of HPV types, generally types 6 or 11, cause external genital warts. Of these, type 6 is more strongly associated with lesions on the penis, while type 11 is the variety that can cause genital warts in men as well as women.", "Genital warts  are caused by some of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Most genital warts are caused by types of HPV 6 and11 that are low risk in that they do not cause cancer but cause genital warts. There are other types of HPV that are high risk in that the known to cause cancer. There are about 40 types of HPV known to infect the genital areas of males and females. Many of the women who have warts do not have moderate to a severe disease. Some women get only a few warts and also develop high risk HPV types that cause cervical cancer.\n\nIs genital warts can be prevented?\n\nSome of the genital warts do not have any treatment in this world. The low risk HPV will cause pain and itchy warts. While many times the low risk HPV is associated with cervical cancer. The vaccine Gardasil was recently licensed to prevent four types of HPV that include the HPV 16 and HPV 18 that cause most of the cervical cancers. The vaccine is recommended for girls and boys aged from 11 to 26 years. HPV vaccine can be given in three doses, at a three month mission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that girls and women aged from 11 to 26 years and women who already have genital warts should be screened. There are many sexual behavior that can play a crucial role to transmit the warts. The high risk types of HPV can be picked up during if it is done improperly. The health workers in the clinic have to check where the warts are in the body. Warts mean cancer cells and they can transmitted to any other parts of the body. It is possible that the genital warts can be treated only if it is diagnosed. But many patients took Wartrol which can remove the virus in their body. Wartrol can destroy the virus and expose the warts. It is similar to remove the tree from ground without losing the root.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPatients need to be aware about this disease in this world. The vaccines should be vaccinated to the children. They should be under control from the surgery and medicines.", "1. What causes genital warts? \u201cThe cause of genital warts is the human papilloma virus \u2013 HPV\u201d wiki answer\n2. Genital warts can be passed on during sexual intercourse but can also be passed on through heavy skin contact with an infected person\u2026. And this is done not only with genital parts but also when someone touches a part of the body covered by clothes, then touches his/her genital parts\u2026.\n3. Genital warts come about when someone has an HPV infection. The virus causes particles like tiny little shells to appear on the skin surface, they can be on the vaginal area, penis or even buttocks.\n4. Usually, before the warts can surface, some itching can be felt but as would be the case with most viral infections, it is always not clear when the warts are going to appear as some are there for years before they erupt on the body.\n5.

Experimental medicine has anchored biomedical research by providing the experimental and conceptual frameworks to connect human pathophysiology to basic biological research. Yet, formal approaches have evolved at this interface only recently, with the formalization of translational science as a scientific field. In this article, we review the history and evolution of animal models of disease in basic biomedical research. We also review the three components of experimental medicine \u2014 biomarkers, drugs, and diagnostics \u2014 each with their unique diseases identified or imagined in a series of translational experiments, and discuss how these have advanced the practice of disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy for the benefit of the public health.\u201d (read more at PubMed)\n\n\u201cThe Prozac generation: how worry for our children has kept a generation hooked on antidepressants\u201d (Daily Mail)\n\n\u201cAntidepressant Use Spikes In Australia\u2026More than one in every 10 Aussie adults and three in every 100 children are using antidepressants\u2026 More than one in every nine men aged 16 to 24 is on drugs to fight clinical depression\u2026Australians under the age of 16 have seen their antidepressant use go from 1 per cent of that age group five years ago to almost 5 per cent today.

{"Question": "What does a low pulse possibly indicate?", "Free_form_answer": "It is normal for an adult to have a pulse rate of 60-100 beats per minute (bpm). If the pulse rate falls below 60 bpm, it is known as bradycardia (low pulse). Bradycardia can be a normal physiological response in healthy individuals during sleep, endurance athletes, and older patients. However, it can also be a symptom of an underlying disease such as obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, infectious diseases, central nervous system conditions, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, anorexia, and hypoxia. Certain drugs like calcium channel blockers, lithium, opioids, and beta blockers can also cause bradycardia.

A low HR may indicate a reduction in stress, considering that an elevated pulse is frequently associated with stress. If you have a low heart rate at rest, you\u2019re not going to be as active and therefore less stressed.\n\n### Exercise\n\nYour last cardio workout may have included a lengthy period of steady-state exercise. This will take time for your body to recover. During the cooldown, a muscle known as the coronary vein will be chilled. Your heart rate is regulated via the coronary vein. When the temperature is low, the blood circulating via the coronary vein is cooled, and the temperature of the blood flowing through the vein decreases if you walk for more than nearly 30 minutes.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re in excellent physical shape, your pulse should be higher than a typical pulse. In order to efficiently get oxygen into the bloodstream, circulation needs to be outstanding.\n\n### Medication and Supplements\n\nOne of the most frequent reasons for a low pulse is prescription drugs like beta-blockers, such as beta-blockers:\n\n- Propranolol\n- Metoprolol\n- Carteolol\n- Atenolol\n\nIf you\u2019re already on certain prescription medications like beta-blockers, you\u2019ll experience a reduced pulse.\n\nThis change in pulse is a sign of a properly functioning medication that is sustaining the quality of your life.

Anyone might obtain some of these drugs\u2019 benefits for high blood stress, calm nerves, migraines, and diabetic nephropathy.\n\nAs medications start to work, heart rate and blood pressure may drop. This has a stabilizing impact on our health. You\u2019ll feel better and less anxious if your heart rate or blood pressure drops.\n\n## What are the Side Effects of a Low Pulse?\n\nIf you", "Low blood pressure is not always a bad thing. There are many people who are born with constant low blood pressure. Diabetics are also known to have low blood pressure.

Older grownups might have a pulse rate that drops into the low 50s.\n\nMaking use of An Overdozing Metabolic Rate To Lose Weight.\n\nPulses of 40 or reduced, or slower, are taken into consideration much less typical till they reach 20. At this factor, a physician making use of a pulse oximeter will certainly see that the patient has a much slower pulse than is taken into consideration typical or healthy and balanced.\n\nLook At Your Health Even More Better.\n\nA heart price of 20 beats each min coincides as a pulse rate that\u2019s five times slower than your age. Therefore, an under 30 age can maintain a pulse rate of 20 or reduced beats per min. Despite the fact that a low pulse rate is not always an indication of a heart disease, also a really health individual doing exhausting workout instructors may experience a pulse rate that\u2019s under 30 beats each min not lasting. Aerobics Instructor\u2019s psychological stress is another regular cause of pulse races obtain this reduced.\n\nA dashing efficiency might push an older person\u2019s pulse rate as high as 130 beats each min, or more. Yet what might this degree of heart prices result in? There are a number of positive effects of exercise. Nonetheless, it could also worsen troubles for some individuals that are vulnerable to severe fat burning. The country\u2019s major professional organization in CPR and very first aid, the American Heart Association, keeps in mind that an initiative to manually supply the heart with oxygen and advise some individuals of a lower heart price coincides.", "Is an elevated heart rate unhealthy? What actually occurs during exercise, as your heart rate rises and falls? This easy science lesson can assist you in understanding how much exercise you need and whether or not it is beneficial to you.\n\nHow does a human heart work?\n\nWhat initially comes to mind is an image of four chambers, the right and left atria, and the right and left ventricles, but there is a lot more going on inside that can boggle the mind.\n\nDespite the fact that your heart is probably receiving 30 to 40 breaths per minute on a regular basis, your brain imposes this regulating.

The cervical spine carries seven cervical vertebrae. These vertebrae protect the spinal cord.\n\nDamaged nerves can cause physical symptoms, such as tingling, pain or numbness. Radiculopathy is a medical term that can be used to describe many conditions that cause nerve irritation.\n\n## What are the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy?\n\nCervical radiculopathy can cause pain and stiffness in the neck. You may notice numbness in your arms and hands or fingers. However, damage or compression of a cervical disc or its surrounding tissues can occur at different areas in your neck and only cause pain and stiffness in that area.\n\nYou may also experience loss of sensation in your back, although this area is typically unaffected by cervical radiculopathy. Inflammation of the spine can present as neck, shoulder or arm weakness. If you have muscle weakness, you should see a medical provider right away because the problem can be life threatening.\n\nIt is common to experience symptoms at 22, 32, 42 or 52 years old depending on where the nerve damage is.\n\n## What causes cervical radiculopathy?\n\nA variety of factors increase the chance of developing cervical radiculopathy. For example, the natural deterioration of the spinal discs as you age can make you prone to problems. Spinal stenosis occurs when the space within the spine narrows. As a result, you may experience clumsiness,  numbness, and pain during strenuous activities.\n\nDegenerative spondylolisthesis is a condition in which one vertebrae slips over the vertebra below it causing it. Over time, spondylolisthesis can compress the nerve in your spinal cord. It may also be caused by a genetic disorder or injury from trauma.\n\nHerniated cervical discs (slipped discs) are among the most common causes of radiculopathy", "Basically, it\u2019s an underwhelming and very unostentatious way of saying pinched spinal nerve. To clarify, a pinched or pressurized spinal nerve can, in a myriad of ways, create all manner of problems throughout the body. The result is manifested as an immense, troublesome symptom or symptoms. Essentially, given the peripheral locations of the upper extremities versus the multiple, close-to-the-trunk lower extremity nerves, radiculopathies tend to involve much more disconcerting, recalcitrant problems compared to sciatica. Let\u2019s take a closer look at this neck issue.\n\nIn this article, we at Smart Health Advisors\u2014a complimentary access source of short, easy-to-search, informative, save-to-your-library essays by finger joint hand specialist Dr. Tom L. Beasley regarding diagnosed upper limb disorders\u2014will attempt to provide you with the basics of this neck issue, including its proper therapeutic handling. Feel free, accordingly, to contact us at any time with questions regarding such a matter.\n\n## Cervical Radiculopathy Background\n\nAs is the case with most upper extremity disorders, cervical radiculopathy affords a long list of available terms that can be confusing. This neck disorder contains the traditional terms of herniated disc, cervical stenosis, cervical foramen stenosis, radiculitis (inflammation of avascular radicle with nerve root venous drainage thrombosis), and cervical root neuritis (infiltration of nerve root by lymphatic cells and plasma cells).\n\nAs it should be obvious by now, a pinched spinal nerve is an incredibly complex issue without cut and dry rules on which to treat and stabilize it. The shear volume of neuroanatomic considerations is enormous. Yes, as we see with the entire upper limb, the spinal cord\u2019s lower cervical spine is stratified anatomically. There are 5 cervical regions total numbered C1-C7, beginning with C1\u2019s placement behind the occupied anterior anatomic joints known as the altanto occipital condyles. C2 is then placed anteriorly to the C1 base, and conforming to how the ensuing lower cerv", "What is a pinched nerve, and how can it be treated? Can they be back problems? What causes pain to result in the leg?\n\nThese are only some of the questions that we are going to take a look at today when it comes to experienced chiropractors and their middle cervical root accessory area nerves being responsible for cervical radiculopathy.\n\n## The Most Common Area That Gets Pinched Nerves is in the Cervical Spine.\n\nDo not worry, in the event that you are injured, your chiropractor can safely correct the nerve from being pinched. In addition to that, there are a number of alternatives to getting this test conducted at the place where you have the best contact with your specialist.\n\nThere are a lot of people that get injured over the weekend or on a weekday and so the only way they can contact their chiropractor is to perform the cervical spine therapy.\n\nBefore we start with the chiropractors and their middle cervical root accessory area nerves, let us find out what happens if a nerve is pinched in your spine.\n\nThere is a segment of the spinal cord in our central nervous system that is roughly divided into four regions.\n\n- Lumbar roots\n- Thoracic roots\n- Cervical roots\n- Cervical nerve roots\n\nThe lumbar spine will ideally have five nerve roots with names such as:\n\n- L1\n- L2\n- L3\n- L4\n- L5\n\nIf you look long enough, you will realize that there is an S-shaped curvature between the front and the back of the body. The L-shaped area is called the lumbar vertebra.\n\nIf your spine does not grow or mature properly, it can result in pain, swollen, and or worse, difficulty in moving your joints.\n\nAt the other end of the spine: the back, there are five lumbar segments\n\nThe L5 nerve roots connect to the lumbar roots\n\nThe L-spine segments can be pinched by two structures:\n\n- the facet joint\n- the intervertebral discs\n\nWhen this happens, you will feel numbness or pain, depending upon the location.\n\nFor example, if you have a pinched nerve in your neck region, it can cause pain", "Cervical radiculopathy is another name for a pinched nerve in your neck. A pinched nerve happens when a nerve in your neck (usually the one in your cervical spine) has been squeezed, compressed or irritated by either a different bone pressing on it (like a herniated disc in your cervical spine) or by some accident physically and literally squeezing it (such as when you pull your neck at an awkward angle by jerking a muscle and spraining it). As a result, your pinched nerve becomes irritable and inflamed, and its sensitivity and quickness to irritation is magnified.\n\nAnother way to think of cervical radiculopathy? Pain from central nerves in the neck, most often in the cervical area, moving down into your arms and hands.\n\nSigns and symptoms of cervical radiculopathy\n\nPinched nerves in your neck radiate tingling and itching sensations from your neck into your upper extremities. That\u2019s what happens most often with the pain of the Central Nervous System leading to Cervical Radiculopathy. Most often radiculopathy symptoms show as arm pain, migraine headaches and numbness in the arms and hands. Other symptoms related to cervical radiculopathy include:\n\n- Numbness in your fingers and/or hands\n- Odd tingling sensations running up and down your arms.\n- Muscle weakness in your arms and hands.\n- A burning sensation around the edge of your shoulder blades or on the top part of your shoulders.\n- Pain running down your arms, numbness or a tingling sensation in your arms or hands.\n- A hand that feels like it has gone to sleep, which also can be caused by a trapped nerve or spinal root damage, or a trapped spinal nerve\n\nCervical braces for cervical radiculopathy\n\nHave you been prescribed to use a neck brace or cervical brace?\n\nWhile over-the-counter and prescription medications and freezing therapies may alleviate your pain and improve your conditions, most of these methods provide only temporary relief. In severe cases, neck braces can be helpful, because these types of cervical braces limit movement restrictions and alleviate pain while certain conditions heal."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5847, "rouge1_r": 0.2355, "rouge1_f1": 0.3358, "rouge2_p": 0.1795, "rouge2_r": 0.0719, "rouge2_f1": 0.1027, "rougel_p": 0.4068, "rougel_r": 0.1638, "rougel_f1": 0.2336, "bleurt": 0.4319, "bert_score_p": 0.8482, "bert_score_r": 0.8712, "bert_score_f1": 0.8595, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5339, "rouge1_r": 0.1632, "rouge1_f1": 0.25, "rouge2_p": 0.1368, "rouge2_r": 0.0416, "rouge2_f1": 0.0637, "rougel_p": 0.2966, "rougel_r": 0.0907, "rougel_f1": 0.1389, "bleurt": 0.2934, "bert_score_p": 0.8159, "bert_score_r": 0.84, "bert_score_f1": 0.8277, "hallucination": 23.076923076923077, "comprehensive": 83.33333333333334}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.6271, "rouge1_r": 0.2364, "rouge1_f1": 0.3434, "rouge2_p": 0.2222, "rouge2_r": 0.0833, "rouge2_f1": 0.1212, "rougel_p": 0.3898, "rougel_r": 0.147, "rougel_f1": 0.2135, "bleurt": 0.3398, "bert_score_p": 0.8367, "bert_score_r": 0.8616, "bert_score_f1": 0.849, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4915, "rouge1_r": 0.1812, "rouge1_f1": 0.2648, "rouge2_p": 0.0684, "rouge2_r": 0.0251, "rouge2_f1": 0.0367, "rougel_p": 0.2627, "rougel_r": 0.0969, "rougel_f1": 0.1416, "bleurt": 0.2848, "bert_score_p": 0.8036, "bert_score_r": 0.8401, "bert_score_f1": 0.8215, "hallucination": 92.3076923076923, "comprehensive": 16.666666666666664}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5508, "rouge1_r": 0.1847, "rouge1_f1": 0.2766, "rouge2_p": 0.1197, "rouge2_r": 0.0399, "rouge2_f1": 0.0598, "rougel_p": 0.2627, "rougel_r": 0.0881, "rougel_f1": 0.1319, "bleurt": 0.3422, "bert_score_p": 0.8004, "bert_score_r": 0.8415, "bert_score_f1": 0.8205, "hallucination": 7.6923076923076925, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5847, "rouge1_r": 0.2029, "rouge1_f1": 0.3013, "rouge2_p": 0.1538, "rouge2_r": 0.0531, "rouge2_f1": 0.0789, "rougel_p": 0.339, "rougel_r": 0.1176, "rougel_f1": 0.1747, "bleurt": 0.356, "bert_score_p": 0.8297, "bert_score_r": 0.8549, "bert_score_f1": 0.8421, "hallucination": 15.384615384615385, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

This simple but complex mechanism is known as innate immunity. When antibodies are unable to prevent itself or accumulate enough of them, the body has the ability to produce more and this \u201cmobilisation\u201d of the immune system strengthens greatly when the virus replication is inhibited. This is exactly what occurs with Valtrex, as the antibodies bind with the virus particle and block the cell from becoming infected.\n\n## Valtrex infection\n\nHumans are affected by more than 170 species of viruses within the herpesvirus family. The largest number of people have had a virus infection that has remained dormant all their lives, flaring here and there, usually on the mucous membranes of the lips and the skin around the lips, eye, or nose with small and painful wounds, which take weeks or sometimes even months to heal.\n\n## Is Valtrex useful for vaccination?\n\nVaccination is a prophylaxis to help prevent the emergence of active virus and thus a natural immunity. With this type of prophylaxis, one should use certain vaccines depending on the type of virus. Each one has its purpose in preventing the infection from an active virus. With vaccination, the body has the opportunity to be exposed to just the virus part and defences can be built that can bind the virus and prevent it from entering and infecting the cell. Therefore with Valtrex in vaccination, viruses that are not caused by bacterial invasion will have imminent antibodies for the virus, and if a virus erupts to prevent the virus from binding to the skin cell, then in itself, vaccination is successful.\n\n## Valtrex instructions\n\nCommon side effects:\n\n- Nausea;\n- diarrhea;\n- Rash;\n- Fever;\n- Headache;\n- Dizziness' or vomiting;\n- Difficulty swallowing;\n- Itching;\n- Allergic reactions.", "Valtrex is a medicine that is used by the patients to treat the disease or two known as Herpes Simplex, Herpes (-2) and Genital Herpes that is caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus.

Symptoms of dyslexia, a reading disorder, can manifest during infancy. A toddler may exhibit some clumsiness typical of infants.

If your pet is experiencing any of these symptoms, make an appointment with your veterinarian right away.\n\nWhy are neurological issues in pets so serious?\n\nThe brain and central nervous system are very complex systems, and disorders of the peripheral (nerve) and central (brain) nervous system may affect multiple systems or affect them in multiple ways. Some neurological disorders are due to inherent deficiencies (genetic) and others occur due to illness or accidents. Regardless, these disorders must be recognized early, treated rapidly, and preventative measures must be employed quickly to help manage the condition.\n\nWhat are some common neurological disorders in small animals?\n\nThe spectrum of neurological disorders in pets is huge, but here a few of the most common signs we see in our patients.\n\nCerebellar disease\n\nThis is damage to the part of the brain responsible for coordinating the limbs, coordination, and fine-tuning of movements. This can be easily identified when your pet appears wobbly, walks in circles, head-presses, or falls. It is often hereditary in breeds such as Pekinese, but is occasionally seen in other animals\n\nIntervertebral disc disease\n\nThe intervertebral discs (IVD) separate the vertebrae in the vertebral column. IVD\u2019s are partitioned by a ring of tough connective tissue and cushioned by a gelatinous centre. IVD\u2019s undergo degenerative changes like any connective tissue in the body, and in the spine, this degeneration tends to affect the gelatinous portion in the centre of the disc. This gelatinous portion can bulge outwards, herniate through the rings of connective tissue, and pressing on the spinal cord or the nerves within that space. Pathological changes to IVD\u2019s can cause severe neurological dysfunction, and either needs to be managed medical until the areas heals.

According to a report by Schlessinger et al., ^{1 }the obvious current choices for topical corticosteroid treatments \u2014 hydrocortisone and betamethasone 17-valerate (Istaladerm^{\u00ae}) \u2014 fall short either in terms of potency or delivery profile. In this report, the authors compared these two key topical steroids with 10 new chemical entities of topical corticosteroids with different potencies. For potency measurements of 30% hydrocortisone cream, both betamethasone 17-valerate and 1% hydrocortisone cream rated better than scenario numbers 1 or 10 in all location, formulation and sensitivity of measures; the researchers noted that neither of these two topical steroids showed species-dependent behavior. The author then found that 10 new corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone, betamethasone 17-valerate, and BDP (budesonide), differed in behavior by location, formulation and sensitivity in the same measures. The authors conclude that \u201cfor topical steroid formulation in veterinary dermatological practice, both the potency of the steroid used and the formulation of the steroid are important to consider.\u201d Furthermore, it is concluded that no product of new steroid potencies can be used properly in all veterinary areas, although, for occasional use in veterinary dermatological practice, the currently available hydrocortisone and Isdalae\u00ae steroids should be satisfactory. In general, betamethasone parabenes are used for the basal cell cancer prevention protocol. Betamethasone may be used at the end of a pulse to promote controlled release of drug from the stratified epithelium and reduce necrosis or irritation, both common complications seen with topical steroids. Betamethasone also works well when larger traumatic injury happens because phototherapy after the injury would otherwise likely complicate the healing process.\nDermatophytosis is caused by various species of"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5098, "rouge1_r": 0.1831, "rouge1_f1": 0.2694, "rouge2_p": 0.1683, "rouge2_r": 0.0601, "rouge2_f1": 0.0885, "rougel_p": 0.3039, "rougel_r": 0.1092, "rougel_f1": 0.1606, "bleurt": 0.4551, "bert_score_p": 0.8266, "bert_score_r": 0.8673, "bert_score_f1": 0.8465, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 40.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.6373, "rouge1_r": 0.2218, "rouge1_f1": 0.3291, "rouge2_p": 0.198, "rouge2_r": 0.0685, "rouge2_f1": 0.1018, "rougel_p": 0.3627, "rougel_r": 0.1263, "rougel_f1": 0.1873, "bleurt": 0.3154, "bert_score_p": 0.8172, "bert_score_r": 0.8729, "bert_score_f1": 0.8442, "hallucination": 60.0, "comprehensive": 40.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4314, "rouge1_r": 0.1833, "rouge1_f1": 0.2573, "rouge2_p": 0.0693, "rouge2_r": 0.0293, "rouge2_f1": 0.0412, "rougel_p": 0.2353, "rougel_r": 0.1, "rougel_f1": 0.1404, "bleurt": 0.3524, "bert_score_p": 0.7987, "bert_score_r": 0.8474, "bert_score_f1": 0.8223, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4412, "rouge1_r": 0.3629, "rouge1_f1": 0.3982, "rouge2_p": 0.1089, "rouge2_r": 0.0894, "rouge2_f1": 0.0982, "rougel_p": 0.2647, "rougel_r": 0.2177, "rougel_f1": 0.2389, "bleurt": 0.3695, "bert_score_p": 0.8459, "bert_score_r": 0.8478, "bert_score_f1": 0.8469, "hallucination": 10.0, "comprehensive": 90.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5294, "rouge1_r": 0.18, "rouge1_f1": 0.2687, "rouge2_p": 0.099, "rouge2_r": 0.0334, "rouge2_f1": 0.05, "rougel_p": 0.2647, "rougel_r": 0.09, "rougel_f1": 0.1343, "bleurt": 0.2928, "bert_score_p": 0.807, "bert_score_r": 0.8537, "bert_score_f1": 0.8297, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 20.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4902, "rouge1_r": 0.1672, "rouge1_f1": 0.2494, "rouge2_p": 0.1089, "rouge2_r": 0.0369, "rouge2_f1": 0.0551, "rougel_p": 0.2745, "rougel_r": 0.0936, "rougel_f1": 0.1397, "bleurt": 0.2978, "bert_score_p": 0.8079, "bert_score_r": 0.8424, "bert_score_f1": 0.8248, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 20.0}]}

The main symptoms of sciatica can include pain, numbness, burning, and weakness that radiate along the path of the sciatic nerve.\n\nHow Is It Treated?\n\nHow is your sciatica treated? Treatment is recommended by your doctor, some of which may include:\n\n- Medication\n- Cortison shots in severe cases\n- Massage\n- Physical Therapy\n- See a Chiropractor\n\nLeg Length Discrepancy\n\nLeg Length Discrepancy is when the leg bones, measured from the crest of the pelvis to the ground, are not an equal length.

It can feel like a tingling, burning or sharp shooting pain or it may feel really miserable, like the muscles are being twisted \u2013 it can even hit through to the foot. But sciatica doesn\u2019t mean the end of your social life. We\u2019ve put together some practical tips on how to ease it when it pops its ugly head!\n\nWhat does sciatica really mean?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to misinterpret the term \u2018sciatica\u2019 as meaning the complete and utter ache that you feel when you grip your face, stick out your tongue and plant your hands on your knees and pull your chin to your chest....which of course is a form of the Alexander Technique (www.alexandertechnique-musculoskeletalpain.com).\n\nHowever, spending time on an Alexander Technique teacher soon sorts that impish pain out.\n\nBut what sciatica really means is pain radiating from the base of your spine, from the nerve roots of your sciatic nerve\u2026grip your face, stick your tongue out, plant your hands on your knees, pull your head back to your pelvis and ditch those postural habits actually give you the postural realignment you really need to free up sciatica pain.\n\nSo just what is sciatica? It\u2019s not a disease, it\u2019s not a condition, it\u2019s not a terminology for a cramp in the buttock. It refers to the pain that we feel in the leg due to compression of the nerve which travels from the lower back through the buttock and down through the leg. While sciatica doesn\u2019t mean your whole body is \u2018out of alignment\u2019 (as your posture is most often associated with making sciatica worse) it definitely means a part of you is \u2013 this is why proper postural alignment is fundamental to getting help with this annoying problem.\n\nPreventing sciatica\n\nSciatica can be aggravated by a series of things so it\u2019s really important to take action fast by choosing to go with good posture. That means \u2013 for whoever might be witnessing your preferences, not plopping down on a cushioned seat\u2026instead sit on a zafu", "Sciatica is a collective term for the symptoms of leg pain and possibly tingling, numbness or weakness that occurs when a spinal nerve in your lower back is compressed. This nerve is called your sciatic nerve.\n\nSciatica is quite a common condition and it is estimated that 2 in 10 people will suffer an episode of sciatica at some point in their lives. In most case the sciatica is an episode that occurs only once in your life but, for some individuals, it may be the first sign of a more chronic back problem.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of sciatica?\n\nIn the majority of cases sciatica will only affect one side of the body. Symptoms can be intermittent and follow a pattern of flare up and settling down over time.\n\nTypical symptoms include:\n\n- pain in the buttock and leg that can be as severe as a burning or stabbing sensation\n- numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg and/or foot\n- a pins and needles sensation, where the affected leg and/or foot turn numb and can feel heavy\n- hot and cold flushes\n- a shooting pain in the affected leg which is reproduced when the leg is stretched \u2013 this is known as \u2018sciatic claudication\u2019\n\nHow long does sciatica last?\n\nWhen someone first visits me in my clinic for assessment and treatment, the question I am most commonly asked is \u2018How long will my sciatica last?\u2019. As with 98% of any health problem, the quicker the action is taken to relieve the cause of the problem the quicker the pain will start to resolve.  Within three to six weeks most episodes of sciatica improve.  If it doesn\u2019t then your MRIs may show that you have other abnormalities.  If you are experiencing symptoms from a pinched down nerve resulting in leg pain then there are chances that it could be a more forward rotated pelvis (slipped disc, disc bulge) or perhaps there is a disc prolapsed which is bulging forwards due to an loss of lordosis (sway back posture).\n\nHow to prevent sciatica?\n\nIn order to prevent sciatica from coming back it is often helpful to relieve any of the common causes, such as:\n\n-"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3973, "rouge1_r": 0.2808, "rouge1_f1": 0.329, "rouge2_p": 0.1121, "rouge2_r": 0.0791, "rouge2_f1": 0.0928, "rougel_p": 0.2098, "rougel_r": 0.1483, "rougel_f1": 0.1738, "bleurt": 0.3389, "bert_score_p": 0.8222, "bert_score_r": 0.8368, "bert_score_f1": 0.8294, "hallucination": 5.263157894736842, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.4241, "rouge1_r": 0.2746, "rouge1_f1": 0.3333, "rouge2_p": 0.0987, "rouge2_r": 0.0638, "rouge2_f1": 0.0775, "rougel_p": 0.2188, "rougel_r": 0.1416, "rougel_f1": 0.1719, "bleurt": 0.2874, "bert_score_p": 0.8123, "bert_score_r": 0.8395, "bert_score_f1": 0.8257, "hallucination": 31.57894736842105, "comprehensive": 57.14285714285714}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.5134, "rouge1_r": 0.2868, "rouge1_f1": 0.368, "rouge2_p": 0.0897, "rouge2_r": 0.05, "rouge2_f1": 0.0642, "rougel_p": 0.1964, "rougel_r": 0.1097, "rougel_f1": 0.1408, "bleurt": 0.3321, "bert_score_p": 0.8253, "bert_score_r": 0.8464, "bert_score_f1": 0.8357, "hallucination": 31.57894736842105, "comprehensive": 57.14285714285714}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3438, "rouge1_r": 0.4904, "rouge1_f1": 0.4042, "rouge2_p": 0.0852, "rouge2_r": 0.1218, "rouge2_f1": 0.1003, "rougel_p": 0.1562, "rougel_r": 0.2229, "rougel_f1": 0.1837, "bleurt": 0.3134, "bert_score_p": 0.852, "bert_score_r": 0.8485, "bert_score_f1": 0.8502, "hallucination": 10.526315789473683, "comprehensive": 100.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.4375, "rouge1_r": 0.2627, "rouge1_f1": 0.3283, "rouge2_p": 0.0762, "rouge2_r": 0.0457, "rouge2_f1": 0.0571, "rougel_p": 0.1741, "rougel_r": 0.1046, "rougel_f1": 0.1307, "bleurt": 0.3037, "bert_score_p": 0.8128, "bert_score_r": 0.8293, "bert_score_f1": 0.821, "hallucination": 52.63157894736842, "comprehensive": 28.57142857142857}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5045, "rouge1_r": 0.3122, "rouge1_f1": 0.3857, "rouge2_p": 0.1211, "rouge2_r": 0.0748, "rouge2_f1": 0.0925, "rougel_p": 0.2277, "rougel_r": 0.1409, "rougel_f1": 0.1741, "bleurt": 0.334, "bert_score_p": 0.8312, "bert_score_r": 0.8498, "bert_score_f1": 0.8404, "hallucination": 21.052631578947366, "comprehensive": 71.42857142857143}]}

This includes eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you are overweight.\n\nIf lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medication. There are many different types of medications that can be used to treat hypertension. The most common type of medication is a diuretic. Diuretics help the body get rid of excess fluid and salt. This can help lower blood pressure.\n\nOther types of medications that may be used to treat hypertension include beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers.\n\nIt is important to work with your doctor to find the best treatment for you.\n\n## What is the best treatment for hypertension in diabetic patients?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best treatment for hypertension in diabetic patients will vary depending on the individual\u2019s specific health condition and medical history. However, some general tips that may be helpful include:\n\n-Maintaining a healthy weight\n\n-Eating a balanced diet that is low in salt and sugar\n\n-Exercising regularly\n\n-Quitting smoking\n\n-Taking medications as prescribed by a doctor\n\n## What are the best ways to manage hypertension in diabetic patients?\n\nThere are a few things that can be done to help manage hypertension in diabetic patients. First, it is important to make sure that the patient is taking their medication as prescribed. Second, it is important to make sure that the patient is eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Third, it is important to make sure that the patient is monitoring their blood pressure regularly.\n\n## What are the risks of untreated hypertension in diabetic patients?\n\nThe risks of untreated hypertension in diabetic patients are increased risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and vision problems.\n\n## What are the complications of hypertension in diabetic patients?\n\nThe complications of hypertension in diabetic patients can be serious and include heart disease, stroke, kidney", "The answer seems to be that these two diseases go hand in hand when it comes to your blood pressure management.\n\nNow, the analysis of recent research supports the view of many medical experts that people with type 2 diabetes are quite likely to develop hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\nThe findings of a recent study of Oxford University experts were published in The Lancet in July 2008. They analysed all of the available data and results of previous research from 13 trials from around the world and with almost 60,000 people in the group. The results showed:\n\n-People with diabetes who had high blood pressure had a 16% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\n-Those were also found to have a threefold increased risk of death from stroke.\n\n-In addition, people who had high blood pressure and were not adequately being treated for it also had a greater likelihood of getting diabetic retinopathy.\n\n-Finally, those who had hypertension and diabetes also suffered from an impairment of the nerve supply to the eyes, decreasing the control of visual problems. This is medically known as oculomotor disorders.\n\nToday, experts warn that people not only need to limit their weight and follow healthy food habits but also that includes citizens of countries.\n\nTaking hypertension treatment along with diabetes requires attention to the following things:\n\n-Modification of lifestyle, including weight reduction, exercise, and a blanket or healthy food.\n\n-To prevent complications, such as vision problems and heart problems, full antihypertensive treatment is required if needed.\n\n-Blood pressure levels need to be carefully checked and evaluated all the time.\n\nTaking your blood pressure reading can be a challenge. For hypertensive people like me, measuring and keeping track of your blood pressure manually is not only difficult but can turn into a problem.\n\nToday, there are portable blood pressure meters such as timers that help you take your blood pressure without going to a doctor\u2019s office or a drug counters.\n\nBlood pressure measurement using timers is undoubtedly one of the easiest ways to obtain your blood pressure readings in the privacy of your home. simple to operate, 24/7/365 coverage, brings you best-in-class features, such as document", "Bleeding retinal vessel \u2013 the type of eye condition diabetic patients have to worry about.\n\nPatients who have any form of diabetive retinopathy \u2013 especially VEGF associated diabetic retinopathy -do not do well with angiotensim blocker therapy \u2013 such as the medication Losartan \u2013 which is one of the most frequently prescribed blood pressure lowering medications in the US. This sheds light on a more important question.\n\nDoes the Angiotensin II receptor blocker Losartan affect vision in healthy or otherwise healthy individuals?\n\nMedical studies show it does. Even though it\u2019s been with us more than several years Losartan is still not well understood.\n\nFatality risk related to hypertension above 160/95.\n\nIn 2004 a study was published in Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA). 398 well hyprtension patients followed over the course of 12 years. They compared hypertension patients on Losartan versus those on Atenolol. While both medications lower BP Losartan is known to affect the Reniin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system ( RAAS).\n\nAt low dosages Losartan also blocks the aldosterone receptor. Beginning of the study showed no high-fatality risk.\n\nCompare to the 2008 findings.\n\nOver a period of time lower fatality risks became apparent in this particular study which had 212 women and 186 men who were 65 or older, writers of the study told Reuters Health. They agreed that a small number of hypertension patients have no apparent fatality risk, though they are not going into detail yet.\n\nBut a recent medical study reported in journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) 2008 showed Losartan people to be more likely to die from a fatality risk cardiac-related cause with Losartan.\n\nSimilar results in other study groups.\n\n\u2022 2002 \u2022 Losartan was shown to increase risk of diabetes \u2013 or the complications of diabetes.\n\n\u2022 Animal studies have also reports Losartan negative effects \u2013 including adrenal cancer.\n\nFinally, the largest study of all \u2013 reported august 20", "### Doctor's Note\n\nLifestyle modification will prevent over 60% of all strokes and heart attacks.

In general, the treatment of hypertension in diabetics is similar to the approach used to treat everyone else, with the exception of certain classes of medications. Recent guidelines, however, recommend beta-blockers (class of medications not normally used in diabetics due to the risk of aggravating glucose control and glycosuria), as normal blood pressure can be difficult to achieve in diabetics (even with three-drug combinations of other medications), and beta-blockers are highly effective in treating hypertension. However, there is on-going research on this subject and currently no study has substantiated whether or not beta-blockers cause worsening of glucose control in diabetics. Other issues of concern which need further study are the affects of beta-blockers on liver and kidney function, and the effects of beta-blockers on lipids and triglycerides.\n\nIn summary, there is no specific best treatment for hypertension in the diabetic. As with advice given on the topic generally, women under age 50 and men under age 40 with diastolic blood pressures of 100 mm Hg and up should be on antihypertensive treatment as well as patients over the 50 years with diastolic readings over 95 mm Hg and with readings consistently above 90 mm Hg. It would therefore be strongly recommended that diabetics who measure between 90- and 100-mm Hg also begin treatment at this time. Of concern are women with high cholesterol and rise in triglyceride level with estrogen. Estrogen typically raises both cholesterol and, more importantly, triglyceride levels. It is therefore preferable, in my opinion, for the diabetic to delay estrogen treatment until after hypertension is adequately controlled. Given the current recommendations for estrogen treatment, however, and the fact that women often cannot tolerate waiting to initiate hormone replacement therapy, the hormones may be taken with hypertension treatment if both are an absolute medical necessity.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\nThiazides were at one point thought to increase triglycerides;", "The two largest studies on the treatment of hypertension in diabetics reached different conclusions. Are the drugs equally effective and how do doctors choose between them?\n\nMost people with type-II diabetes also have hypertension, and are usually advised to follow a low-salt/low-fat diet and to take medications. Research suggests guided or self-education programs improve compliance with a diet and some medications because they empower patients\n\nto make healthy life choices, and to participate in their own care.\n\nThe ACCORD study, by the National Institutes of Health, and the ALLHAT study, by the U. S. Public Health Service, reached different conclusions regarding the proper treatment for hypertension in diabetics.\n\nThe ACCORD study was designed to see if aggressive treatment of hypertension and diabetes could do more good than harm. Patients were randomized to aggressive treatment of cholesterol and blood sugar or standard care. 10,000 patients were involved in the study, about 2500 had type II diabetes. A subset of the diabetics, 1,069 people, had angiotensin only/class of medication )therapy, another subset 1,387 people had calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy.\n\nThe latter was stopped when it became clear that those patients had a higher risk of death.\n\nThat portion of the study is often described as having a \u201cclear direction.\u201d The same can\u2019t be said of the then two interventions in patients with type-2 diabetes and a history of cardiovascular disease. In those patients, the \u201caggressive treatment\u201d significantly increased the risk of stroke, death, and cardiovascular events, while the \u201cstandard care\u201d did not.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients? If a patient already has two conditions, diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure), paying attention to what doctors say and doing what they advise does make a difference.\n\nSaid Dr. Peter Nickerson, professor of medicine at Binghamton University (Stony Brook), \u201cEven though we can\u2019t cure diabetes, we can manage it, and we can make a real change in the lives of patients.\u201d\n\nFor the ALLHAT study, 33,357.

Such as the color, odor, consistency and transparency of the urine, as well as pH and specific gravity. Urine cytology, occult blood, sugar and protein are also detected. Microscopic examination of the sediment reveals red blood cells, white blood cells and level of epithelial cells. Casts, scales, or crystals can determine the source of the abnormality. Urinalysis is often used to support a diagnosis made by physical examination and other tests.\n\nUrine culture is the isolation of bacteria, identification of organism and determination of their susceptibility to antibiotics. Also known as a bacteriological urine test, it is one of the most important diagnostic procedures for urinary tract infections. The process resembles the culture of another isolate such as blood, sputum or stool. A culture of two or more clean urine samples increases the diagnostic accuracy.", "and they will have an uncontrollable urge to urinate. Pseudoinfection. Clinical evaluation is required if fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, back pain, worsening urinary symptoms, or sick contacts occur. A urine sample helps doctors determine whether your urinary tract infection is bacterial. 9,10 Treatment is with a beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotic for 14 days. Evidence suggests that bacteria, principally Escherichia coli, are the culprits behind the multi-species biofilms thought to be implicated in infections with Candida sp.

The other test, \u201curine culture\u201d, does culture tests to see whether there are bacteria inhabiting in the urine. This can be a non-infected, non-symptomatic urinary tract infection. Urinalysis is often done to determine the presence of an infection. The doctor who ordered the urinalysis will decide whether that person needs to undergo further tests, such as a urine culture.\n\nOther differences\n\nBecause urinalysis is done to diagnose the condition of the urinary tract, it tends to be used to determine whether there is improper functioning pertaining to the organs on that area. On the other hand, a urine culture is done to diagnose whether there are bacteria inhabiting in the urine. It is a part of the diagnosis process for a suspected urinary tract infection (or UTI).", "That urine culture is a staple of clinical practice is unquestioned. But recent studies in the Journal of Urinalysis & Ultrasound have challenged its continually-presumed value. In one study of 175 men with asymptomatic urinary tract infections, 24 resolved spontaneously after 15 days, 13 after 30 days, 4 after 60 days, and 1 after 4 months. Why not wait 1 month before initiating therapy with the suspected organism? A second study compared the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin in 41 healthy urinary tract carriers. There was a trend toward fewer adverse effects in the ciprofloxacin group. The authors concluded that ciprofloxacin was a viable alternative to TMP/SMX. But it\u2019s difficult to draw conclusions from a study that showed that 11 subjects taking ciprofloxacin withdrew from the study primarily because of side effects (5 who could not tolerate the study drug, 3 due to headaches, 2 due to nausea, and 1 due to vomiting). Finally, a 2006 Consensus Conference (hosted by the American Society of Urinary Infections & Urology) concluded that antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in renal transplant recipients does not significantly improve graft function compared to placebo, and that treatment may cause adverse reactions. These studies collectively suggest that, before expending the time and money associated with prescribing an antibiotic, consideration should be given to not scheduling a urine culture at all.\n\n\u2014 Brian K.

Once the container is filled, all panties should be fixed to prevent contamination by lab contamination.\n- What should you prepare for urine testing?\n\nLeave enough time from the previous use to provide a clean sample. Note the color of the urine: darker colors indicate higher sample content. Use a straw or container to urinate into a clean container.\n\nWhere and how should you prepare the sample? It is best to keep the sample in a refrigerator at about 4\u00b0C or lower, as may be recommended.\n\nlog How can I prevent the extract from being contaminated after proper collection\n\nContamination occurs when bacteria from the genitals enter the specimen. This can happen as the person is holding the specimen (if there are traces of bacteria for reasons of insufficient washing, etc.). To prevent contamination:\n\nAnother important factor can be bacterial levels in the area from which you are collecting urine. People who use more intimate hygiene are at higher risk than others.\n\nOnce the source of bacterial contamination is removed, retesting is appropriate. A cylinder of red cells and / or microscopic bacterial symptoms will indicate the possibility of a bacterial cause.\n\nWhat is the use of urinalysis\n\nHow is it used?\n\nUsually, in this case, urine levels are expected to increase at maturity and decrease with age (except for one unit).

Dysuria is the most frequent UTI symptom, although the absence of dysuria is not unusual for uncomplicated UTI. Urethritis often can be differentiated from cystitis historically by the absence of back pain, pallor of urine, and hematuria all of which are characteristic of UTI, by examination of urine sediment, and sometimes by urine culture. Pyelonephritis is far more frequently associated with epididymitis or prostatitis in men than UTI caused by urethritis in women.", "The most common cause of dysuria in young, sexually active, healthy men is urethritis.\n\nUrethritis, an inflammation of the urethra, is usually caused by an infection with Chlamydia (trachomatis) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Dysuria can also be related to STDs, such as herpes simplex and syphilis. Nonsexual causes for urethra infections include balantitis xerotica obliterans, a form of chronic ectodermal dysplasia characterized by hyperkeratosis with ischemic atrophy of the penile mucosa, often in association with balanitis and phimosis. Urethral beading, or onion skin papules, occurs acutely in warm-water contact dermatitis and in terrain urethral stricture.\n\nUrethral crusting can occur with urethritis and balanoposthitis in children with living in apartments with poor ventilation. Urethral strictures and involvement of the female external genitalia with dysuria are always a source of infection. Genital warts, penile lesions secondary to toxic shock syndrome, furunculosis, xanthoma palmaris, pyoderma gangrenosum, tuberculosis, and occasional penile trauma related to intercourse or accident are also associated with dysuria.

Treating a fever can help alleviate accompanying symptoms like headaches, muscle and joint pain, or febrile seizures in children. Medications like acetaminophen (paracetamol) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can be used to lower fever. Acetaminophen is usually recommended first due to fewer side effects than NSAIDs, but short-term use of either drug is safe for healthy individuals without kidney or liver impairment.

Like bacteria, the fungus can enter the cultivation ports, damage", "Folliculitis is a hair follicle infection caused by a number of different bacteria types. The most common is Staphylococcus bacteria, which causes a red-or-white-head bacterial rash that fluctuates to form painful pus-filled hairs. Other less common causes of folliculitis include Pseudomonas Bacteria caused by fungi and Hair Follicle Mite causing Demodex folliculitis.\n\n### What type of folliculitis bacteria is Staphylococcus?\n\nStaphylococcus Aureus is a bacterial infection that small disc-shaped organisms called staphylococcus bacteria causes it. For people who do not have a strong immune system, this infection can move within the deeper layers of skin causing pus-filled lesions with boils, cysts, and abscesses. Eventually, this infection goes to a painful hair follicle infection in terms of appearance to folliculitis\n\n### Identifying Pseudomonas Folliculitis:\n\nPseudomonal folliculitis appears to as hair follicle infection with crusting pustular lesions on the Gardnerella vaginalis hair follicle. Hair follicle infection with Gram-negative Pseudomonas folliculitis are often brownish green and very difficult to remove due to development of acne lesions in the skin of this skin surface creates a major discomfort. Pseudomonas folliculitis may be associated with itching and scratching.\n\nGardnerella vaginalis infection is caused by the heat of folliculitis bacteria, especially among those who are trichotillomaniacs, especially because Gardnerella folliculitis on the face is extremely painful and easily spread to other areas including, groin, legs, and arms with excessive abnormal movements and scratching the surface of the skin this folliculitis treatment for folliculitis of temporary approach.\n\n### How to identify Pseudomonas folliculitis?\n\nPseudomonas folliculitis and burning folliculitis can be widely seen in round hair spots on the surface of the skin. This bacterial folliculitis releases an acidic and burrowing odor causing severe damage and hair loss in case of persistent pus like formation", "Bacteria is the leading cause of folliculitis, a condition which is also the cause of skin irritation, breakouts, and potential scarring of the skin. Folliculitis is a medical term which describes an infection of the hair follicles. Folliculitis describes superficial and inflamed hair follicles which at later stages can result in pustules, papules, and further inflammation. Superficial folliculitis is often associated with Staphylococcus aureus and group A B-haemolytic streptococci.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a common bacteria which can be found in the nose or on the skin. S. aureus is a major cause of hospital acquired infections with mild cases of folliculitis of the hair follicles leading to impetigo which is characterized by pustules and surrounding skin irritation with an itching sensation. An infection typically occurs in the areas of the body covered with hair follicles. Folliculitis may occur with staphylococcal skin infections in individuals with impaired immune causes such as those with immunodeficiency.\n\nSkin infections often occur as a result of S. aureus. These skin infections often clean up with time depending on one\u2019s level of resistance and the immune system. In the case of infection regarding the hair follicle, the infected follicle secretes exfoliative toxins which skew the hair follicles and axilla, giving way to impetigo. Various other types of bacteria can lead to folliculitis, however Staphylococcus Aureus (Aka: S. aureus) is the most common with various strains of the bacteria. S. aureus is also known as the golden Staph.\n\nFolliculitis can come along with rashes, pustules, boils, tiny red dry patchy changes to the skin, leading to papules, vesicles, and pustules. Treatment involves medical treatment with proper care of the affected area and emollients for soothing affect. Antibiotics only address the symptoms temporarily and are not typically the necessary or most effective requirement to address the root cause.

A follicle includes a hair shaft and surrounding tissue, including a sebaceous gland that puts out oil or sebum.\n\nFolliculitis shows up as reddish and slightly swollen patches of skin, often (but not always) with white-topped bumps. The rash is normally itchy but usually harmless.\n\nMultiple shaving, friction, tight clothing, or exposure to hot tubs or whirlpools, can cause the skin to become irritated, also can cause folliculitis.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nFolliculitis usually causes obvious skin irritation, including:\n\n- Slightly swollen patches that have red, pinkish, or sometimes dark red borders\n- Small, clogged hair follicles that may resemble whiteheads or blackheads\n- Pain or itching around the affected area\n\nThe degree of irritation may vary. Some folks may have mild rashes without even realizing they have folliculitis. Folliculitis may resemble ingrown hairs.\n\n## Causes\n\nBacteria are the commonest cause of folliculitis. Most commonly responsible bacteria are staph. The rash can occur if your skin is scratched by a rusty metal object or sharp object; bacteria are not the cause.\n\n## Risk factors\n\nFactors that may put you at an increased risk of developing folliculitis include:\n\n- Antibiotic use\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Some medications, including nicotinic acid or isoniazid\n- Sweating\n- Shaving or waxing your face, legs or other body areas\n- Mesotherapy injections for treating skin, hair or cellulite often result in folliculitis and can occasionally cause scarring\n- Dead follicles\n- Recent cluster of skin", "1.

Note fever, often a complicating issue with breastfeeding newborns.\n\nThings that depress the immune system are BOTH severe stress AND chronic stress (slow burn stress).   Severe stress comes through trauma, or discovered trauma, or the catastrophizing brain.   All of these things generate a massive sympathetic nervous system discharge, cortisol production (a systemic steroid), and a temporary near shut-down of the immune system itself.   The chronic stressors impose a slow grind on the immune system right on down to a complete collapse in most cases.   It is the chronic stress effect that is so adverse to the immune system, not the acute stressor.\n\nI always talk to the brain about this, confiding what I have learned.

Many conditions may result in immunocompromise, such as AIDS, leukemia, and chemo or radiation treatments.\n\nWhat drugs cause immunocompromise?\n\n- Immunosuppressants cause immune system compromise of differing types and severity depending upon the drugs used and the type of immune system involved. Immunosuppressants are used when the immune system creates more of a threat to the patient than do the antigens for which the immune system has been activated. In effect, by inhibiting an immune system response to normal antigens, immunosuppressive drugs open patients receptive to pathogenic invasion.\n\nWhat does humoral immunity mean?\n\n- Humoral immunity is the immune response of the systemic immune system, which is the body's first line of defense against pathogens.\n\nWhat does cellular immunity mean?\n\n- Cell-mediated immunity (CMI), which is also known as cellular immunity or cell-mediated immune response, is a component of the immune system which mediates immune responses against certain pathogens and tumor cells.

It is most commonly found on the upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. Keratosis Pilaris is not contagious and is not harmful to your health.\n\nWhat Causes Keratosis Pilaris?\n\nThe exact cause of Keratosis Pilaris is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a build-up of keratin, a protein that is found in the skin. Keratin is normally shed from the skin, but in people with Keratosis Pilaris, the keratin builds up and causes the bumps to form.\n\nKeratosis Pilaris is more common in people with dry skin, and it is also more common in people with eczema.\n\nHow is Keratosis Pilaris Treated?\n\nThere is no cure for Keratosis Pilaris, but there are treatments that can help to improve the appearance of the bumps.\n\nThe most common treatment for Keratosis Pilaris is a topical cream or lotion that contains urea, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. These creams and lotions help to break down the keratin and improve the appearance of the bumps.\n\nIf the bumps are causing discomfort, a doctor may prescribe a topical steroid cream to help reduce the inflammation.\n\nIn severe cases, a doctor may recommend a laser treatment to remove the bumps.\n\nHow Can I Prevent Keratosis Pilaris?\n\nThere is no sure way to prevent Keratosis Pilaris, but there are things you can do to help reduce the risk.\n\nIf you have dry skin, it is important to keep your skin moisturized. You can do this by using a moisturizer that contains urea, lactic acid, or salicylic acid.\n\nIf you have eczema, it is important to keep your skin moisturized and to avoid scratching or rubbing the bumps.\n\nIf you have Keratosis Pilaris, it is important to avoid using harsh soaps or scrubs on your skin.\n\n## What is the best treatment for keratosis pilaris?\n\nKeratosis pilaris is a common skin condition that causes small, rough bumps", "According to Britannica, Keratosis pilaris (also known as follicular keratosis or simply \"chicken skin\") is an inherited, asymptomatic condition affecting about half of all children and about a quarter to a third of adults. It is characterized by papules (bumps) and small keratotic plugs on the skin's surface. Lesions are most often found on the upper arms and thighs, but can also form around the cheeks, hairline, and buttocks.

But unlike acne, kp can't be prevented by cleaning or washing your face any more often, and much more rarely begins in adulthood due to hormonal or environmental changes (rather than puberty). Kp is also characterized by dryness, where acne is not. Plus, acne typically appears mostly on the face and chin, and is considered to be caused by a combination of oil and dirt being stuck in the pores and leading to infection, combined with hormones.

This skin condition causes raised, thick areas of tiny bumps. Although harmless, keratosis pilaris can look unpleasant and embarrassing. It usually appears at puberty, may last a few years.\n\nSigns and Symptoms\n\nKeratosis pilaris develops when cells in the skin\u2019s inner layer (epidermis) split in abnormal way. This separates keratin, a natural, protein fiber from hair follicles. The dead skin cells then build up around the opening of the hair follicles. These affected hair follicles appear as goose bumps. Although there is a rough texture surrounding these bumps and may appear to be infected, the bumps are usually harmless.\n\nIf you have it, keratosis pilaris usually develops on your face, arms, and legs \u2013 especially on your upper arms and thighs.

In severe cases of Keratosis pilaris, or when ointments and creams do not work, people may choose to take a prescription medicine called tetinoin (Retin-A). Tretinoin is related to Vitamin A. It works like retinoic acid, a substance that your body makes. Tretinoin stimulates the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) to smooth itself and jump-start a new layer. The only drawback is that as this is a prescription drug, it could potentially make the skin a little bit red and sore temporarily. But rest assured, these side effects usually exhibit themselves in widely used cosmetics on the market like for example Clearasil, which can be bought at your local chemist/pharmacist.

Women are four times more likely to suffer from cluster headaches, and they can affect you as early as nine years old. The best time for a cluster headache is around the spring or autumn.\n\nTreatments:\n\nMany cluster headache sufferers take oxygen therapy to deal with a cluster headache. In reality, some sufferers pre-empt the cluster headache with oxygen therapy to prevent it happening in the first place if it is a pattern that\u2019s easily predictable. These sufferers are known as cluster busters and use oxygen therapy. It\u2019s important to use oxygen therapy, or treatments in the correct dosages for them to be effective. Otherwise, the headache will still happen.\n\nUsually, a cluster headache is around forty minutes long, so a dose of oxygen takes around twenty five to thirty minutes to take effect. In some cases, oxygen therapy only lasts about fifty to sixty minutes. If you get to your oxygen therapy in time the pain should begin to subside around the twenty five to thirty minute mark. The oxygen is usually delivered through something like a plastic mask that lies within snugly around your nose and can take either ten litres per minute for five to ten minutes, or five litres per minute for ten minutes followed by the other setting.\n\nSide effects of this oxygen therapy can have a mild nauseous feeling, so for some people it is likely to subside the headache or be directly related to the headache.

Oxygen therapy may be administered at home on an indefinite basis. The amount of oxygen administered usually lessens the severity of the pain fairly quickly (Neurologist-UK, n.d)\n- Melatonin- Supplement (Ageless, 2019)\nThis supplement can help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you have cluster headaches, your neurologist may suggest daily treatment with melatonin, generally prescribed at a dose between 1 and 10 milligrams orally, for a period of two to three months (Neurologist-UK, n.d).\n- Sodium pentosan polysulfate- Drug (Ageless, 2019)\nTreatment-", "The cluster headache tends to attack reoccurring in groups or agglomerations associated with which run the tweezers\u201d (the pupil reduced on the affected side) and sometimes a more watery eye (plepharospasm) and runny nose or blocked nose (rhinorrhoea) on the affected side.

How can I feel better?\n\nWhen you have muscular or joint pain, it is likely that at least one of these drugs was recommended by your doctor for pain relief. Advil and Tylenol are the most common over-the-counter pain pills listed in my patients\u2019 medication lists.\n\n## Ibuprofen found to be gentler on the gut than a common painkiller\n\nBut despite its ubiquity, how did Advil get to be a part of so many treatment plans?\n\nThough available as a nonprescription drug, Advil is actually sold as the generic ibuprofen (or by other brand names). It was first approved by the FDA in 1974 as a prescription drug for the treatment of muscular and joint pain. You may be surprised to learn that ibuprofen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, or NSAID. Its effect on pain is actually secondary to how it reduces inflammation.\n\nMany patients mistakenly assume NSAIDS only relieve pain.\n\nI recently worked up a treatment plan that included ibuprofen for a patient who has a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Surprisingly, he thought Advil would probably make him feel worse because it was a pain pill, and he didn\u2019t want to risk having his symptoms flare up. In fact, not only does ibuprofen help to relieve the pain from his condition, it also reduces the inflammation that aggravates his Chrohn\u2019s disease.\n\n## New study shows pain pills gentler on the gut\n\nAlthough ibuprofen is a stronger anti-inflammatory drug than Tylenol, it is one of very few NSAIDS that has been proven in medical research to be a safer bet for patients with a history of stomach problems.\n\nThis month\u2019s issue of Gastroenterology carries an interesting study that compares ibuprofen and Tylenol for the treatment of GERD related heartburn. (GERD = Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)\n\nAll of the patients studied had a previous history of frequent heartburn related to GERD, and were all asked to measure their heartburn related symptoms before", "Further, it\u2019s probably worse for some than others, and you have probably noticed this all year long. Does it hurt sometimes when you press on it, even though it\u2019s outside your lymphatic system? Think back to when you first started running. This has a lot to do with inflammation or swelling.\n\n## How long should the back pain of a 64 year old last?\n\nWebMD estimates that it only takes about four days for most back pains to heal. However, in more advanced cases or if you\u2019re well into middle age, it will take longer than that, due to cartilage and age-related heel spur pains. Lasting pain could be an indicator of a more serious condition.\n\n## Is taking Tylenol good for back pain?\n\nTaking Tylenol to Lessen the Effects of Back Pain If you have back pain, you may want to consider taking it two to three times a day. This will help your overall health, you will have less pain and will be able to get your daily care done more efficiently. Your back hurts, it can be so frustrating.", "Topical enzyme gels have proven highly effective in pain relief when applied to the surface of the muscle or inflamed joint.

You may have even seen the warning public service announcements on television in the recent ext, but when will we actually take this information to heart and be prepared to identify the signs our friends or family may be sick?\n\nMeningitis affects the coverings of brain and spinal cord, specifically the area where the brain and spinal cord join as they penetrate the skull and the upper vertebrae. When someone has meningitis, bacteria and viruses can irritate the protective layers allowing them to move through the central nervous system and into the bloodstream and body. Fungal, parasitic infections have all been linked to meningitis.\n\nThe brain and spinal cord are protected by three layers. The meninges (meninges) are the first layer outside the brain and spinal cord. The meninges are followed by the pia mater (below the brain) and the arachnoid mater (above the brain) to protect the brain. While the epidural space appears to be important as regards to spinal trauma, it is the meninges that surround the brain and spinal cord like a nest that is at risk in case of trauma or infections to the spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on infection, the affected area, and the age and overall health condition of the patient. Headache is a constant symptom of inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, together with stiff neck and sensitivity to light, and sometimes nausea, vomiting, and fever. The rash is not common, and is usually the danger sign of invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nThe early, most effective treatment is antibiotics, while all of them are not cure meningitis. Antibiotics must be started even before diagnosis is made and doctors must often make an educated guess according to the history and the symptoms.

Since horses are social animals (which is why they also go into the corral or stable to eat, to find protection, just to spend time together), they form groups, and there are also multiple diseases, which can be \u201eshared\u201c between them.  Such infections are assumed and the infection is caused by a bacterium called equivitro and is present only in newly hatched eggs. The bacteria are a vital part of the hen\u00b4s intestines, so it is not a disease of the hen. These bacteria of the egg yolk can penetrate the naso-pharynx of uninfected animals due to a secretion from the eyes. After entering the gut they attack the brain an lead to the meningitis. If the  horse gathers enough strength to defecate and expel the \u201ccreepies\u201d, then everything is fine. If not, then severe meningitis will occur instead, which massively limits the intestinal functions of horses already suffering from \u201csinusitis\u201d.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat can i do?\n\nThe used cling wrap amplifies the negative influence of the menings of other horses.

Menigitis is usually described as the inflammation of the meninges or thin coverings that surround the brain and spinal mouse. It usually occurs in children between two to three years of age. This is very common in developing countries. Only in the Scandinavian countries has there been reported a 0.7% incidence of meningitis in children below two years of age. Children are at a higher being vulnerable to the disease.\n\nIs it contagious?\n\nMenignitis is not always contagious as it is an infection that may be mediated in different ways. The most known route of attack is often not related to the infecting bacteria itself but caused by its toxin Mu who they produce. The bacteria is not that easy to recognize and it is very difficult to pass on. Contact may be similar to nose and mouth infections-the toxin 2i could be inhaled or passed on after just touching a person who has the disease.\n\nIs the disease life threatening?\n\nThe fever and the natural attack of the bacteria may lead to serious complications. There is the damage a brain or the spinal chord. 25% of the infected children lose their hearing ability temporarily or permanently. In some cases, the disease can lead to sudden death. In most cases, the symptoms develop within one to two days of infection.\n\nThe symptoms\n\nThe symptoms mainly include severe headache, body ache and high fever. Some symptoms can also include vomiting, skin rashes, loss or fits and loss of appetite.

Acyclovir is an antiviral used to treat HSV1 (oral herpes), HSV2 (genital herpes), HSV3 (herpes zoster), genital warts (HPV \u2013 Human Papillomavirus), herpangina, and keratitis caused by herpes virus. Valtrex is like Acyclovir and is only used to treat HSV1 (oral herpes) and HSV2 (genital herpes).

Valtrex is used to treat HSV1 (oral herpes)", "Aciclovir and Valtrex are two of the most common medicines used to treat viral genital herpes and herpes labialis (cold sores) of the lips. Valtrex is the brand name for the active ingredient Aciclovir. You might find this surprising, but the active ingredient aciclovir is cheaper and even more versatile. You can apply it topically, for example as a cream or solution, or it can be taken orally, either as a traditional tablet or as a liquid gel solution.\n\nAciclovir has the advantage that you can take it according to your own schedule, whilst valtrex has to be taken twice daily for six days for treatment of genital herpes or just five doses for labialis. The daily dosing option with sometrix is a big advantage. You are in good company as around 100,000 people in the UK use acyclovir to manage the symptoms of herpes and cold sores, both internally and externally.\n\nWhat is the best way to take Ritonavir?\n\nRitonavir is one of a group of medications called protease inhibitors. It very powerful and the dosage medical professionals prescribe a lot of the time is much lower than what is listed in the original product literature. Much like dabrafenib (indinavir), ritonavir is also in the antiretroviral group of medicines.\n\nPatients that we consider suitable to receive Ritonavir should be made aware of the side-effects it can cause, which here is the list. There may be other medicine interactions that are already known, and not listed below: Avanafil (50mg/100mg), Dabrafenib (150mg), Dampretaltiral-12 (120/400mg), Clonixin (120mg, 400mg), Diglycin Glucuron (50mg), Ketoconazole (10mg), Gramelin (150mg) & of course Ritonavir (120mg).\n\nWhat is the difference between placebos and people who believe a treatment will work?\n\nDuring , many people report that the placebo treatment they believe is to effect, definitely", "Humans make terpenes as part of their metabolism. They are one of the ways to provide flexibility to cell membranes and are the precursors to many important molecules. For example, enzymes use farnesyl pyrophosphate to organize interior of the cell. And the cholesterol metabolism pathway begins with squalene.\n\nMany plants put out terpene scents as a secondary metabolite as their way to attract pollinators. The formation of terpenes involves the reaction of two 5 Carbon units called Isopentenyl pyrophosphate into sesquiterpenes. That is why terpene is a generic term for a group of similar molecules.\n\nBasically Terpenes are used to make cannabinoids. Prior to hemp legalization in the United States, terpenes were being widely misunderstood. The cannabis industry was just starting to appropriately classify and catalog different strains of the plant.\n\nThe vast majority of cannabis was being grown illicitly, and the community was not willing to share knowledge. So we had a situation where many companies were selling terpenes to CBD producers when hemp became legal in 2018. The legalization of CBD if anything led to uncertainty as the market blossomed.\n\nToday all CBD for distribution needs to have the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) lab and tested to ensure that it is compliant under federal regulations. The constituents of the CBD product must come from a cannabis strain that has been made legal under the 2018 Farm Bill and the relevant state marijuana act or regulations.\n\nHemp is the fruit of the cannabis plant used to produce CBD. The hemp profile contains THC levels within those found in poppies, meaning hemp oil does not have a psychoactive effect when introduced to the body. CBD, or cannabidiol, is CBD in poppy seeds is not intoxicating, has no accepted medicinal use for humans, and is not acquired as a food stamp.\n\nOne gram of CBD will last about a week.", "Valtrex is a newer version of generic medicine that was originally released to market in 1977. While more doctors and patients have grown to trust and prescribe the Valtrex version of Acyclovir, there is not much that can help in case Valtrex runs out of stock.\n\nAcyclovir has multiple uses as an antiviral including for chicken pox, shingles, and cold sores and Valtrex is only for the Herpes and Cold Sore outbreaks.\n\nDespite Acyclovir being 20 years older and around 23% cheaper than Valtrex, many patients still trust Valtrex and say it works better because of it being a newer version.", "Valacyclovir is the prodrug of Acyclovir, meaning it is converted to acyclovir during metabolism. Acyclovir is then converted to acyclic acid. The fact that valacyclovir hydrolyses to acyclovir means that during metabolism, there are two possible sites of deactivation of the drug (acyclovir and valacyclovir). Acyclovir is extensively deactivated by human plasma esterases, whereas Valacyclovir is less prone to deactivation than Acylovir (Gardner and Monroe, 1984). The major difference between acyclovir and valacyclovir is in their dosages. Since Valacyclovir has a longer half-life than acyclovir, lower dosages can be used during treatment of HSV 1.\n\nAre antivirals the same as antimicrobials?\n\nAntimicrobial generally refers to agents that kill germs, like some antivirals. They might be antibiotics that target bacteria, or antivirals, or antifungals, etc, to treat infections. Some antivirals are used in high doses to kill microorganisms. An example would be valacyclovir that has a secondary use as an antimicrobial and has been used in super-high doses to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria in the blood. Antivirals are also mainly used in higher doses for bactericidal purposes like killing moulds.\n\nWhen should I use the anti-microbial tool for?\n\nValacyclovir, famciclovir, aciclovir and penciclovir are antiviral agents first and foremost. They should only be used against bacteria in high doses as an antibacterial agent on the recommendation of an expert. Acyclovir does not have a gram-positive antibacterial activity, it would take 10 times the dose of acyclovir for an immune-compromised patient to achieve the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed for gram-positive bacteria, like staph, to be killed.\n\nWhat are the non-antimicrobial side-effects of Valacyclovir?\n\nValacycl"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4962, "rouge1_r": 0.2185, "rouge1_f1": 0.3034, "rouge2_p": 0.1212, "rouge2_r": 0.0532, "rouge2_f1": 0.0739, "rougel_p": 0.3459, "rougel_r": 0.1523, "rougel_f1": 0.2115, "bleurt": 0.4637, "bert_score_p": 0.8072, "bert_score_r": 0.8354, "bert_score_f1": 0.8211, "hallucination": 12.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5414, "rouge1_r": 0.2491, "rouge1_f1": 0.3412, "rouge2_p": 0.1591, "rouge2_r": 0.0729, "rouge2_f1": 0.1, "rougel_p": 0.2782, "rougel_r": 0.128, "rougel_f1": 0.1754, "bleurt": 0.3448, "bert_score_p": 0.8196, "bert_score_r": 0.8438, "bert_score_f1": 0.8315, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4436, "rouge1_r": 0.1967, "rouge1_f1": 0.2725, "rouge2_p": 0.0909, "rouge2_r": 0.0401, "rouge2_f1": 0.0557, "rougel_p": 0.2331, "rougel_r": 0.1033, "rougel_f1": 0.1432, "bleurt": 0.3362, "bert_score_p": 0.8149, "bert_score_r": 0.8513, "bert_score_f1": 0.8327, "hallucination": 37.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.3233, "rouge1_r": 0.1387, "rouge1_f1": 0.1941, "rouge2_p": 0.0379, "rouge2_r": 0.0162, "rouge2_f1": 0.0227, "rougel_p": 0.1729, "rougel_r": 0.0742, "rougel_f1": 0.1038, "bleurt": 0.2849, "bert_score_p": 0.7922, "bert_score_r": 0.7779, "bert_score_f1": 0.785, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3083, "rouge1_r": 0.4059, "rouge1_f1": 0.3504, "rouge2_p": 0.0455, "rouge2_r": 0.06, "rouge2_f1": 0.0517, "rougel_p": 0.1278, "rougel_r": 0.1683, "rougel_f1": 0.1453, "bleurt": 0.3587, "bert_score_p": 0.8518, "bert_score_r": 0.8347, "bert_score_f1": 0.8431, "hallucination": 62.5, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.4962, "rouge1_r": 0.2435, "rouge1_f1": 0.3267, "rouge2_p": 0.1515, "rouge2_r": 0.0741, "rouge2_f1": 0.0995, "rougel_p": 0.2256, "rougel_r": 0.1107, "rougel_f1": 0.1485, "bleurt": 0.3187, "bert_score_p": 0.8339, "bert_score_r": 0.8552, "bert_score_f1": 0.8444, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 100.0}]}

When visiting a vestibular specialist, you are usually referred to a general physician and referred to an ENT specialist. However, when you have severe vertigo, it is recommended that you visit a sleep clinic or a neurologist for a full examination. This is necessary because these specialists usually concentrate on determining the underlying reason for the dizziness and not just treating it with drugs. In fact, when you go to the emergency department of a hospital, your headache is confirmed as coming from an underlying problem.\n\n## How to choose the right doctor for your vertigo?\n\nThere are several signs that indicate that you might have to suffer from vertigo. For cases of severe vertigo, the doctors usually advise patients to use medication to control the constant dizziness. However, this treatment is not useful as it is not the main cause of vertigo in most cases. Therefore, it is best to consult a vestibular specialist who can determine if you have an underlying problem and recommend a remedy for it.\n\nDizziness, dizziness, and fainting are some of the common symptoms of vertigo. For those suffering from these symptoms, they should ensure that they see a professional neurologist for treatment. The first thing that most of these specialists do is to examine the inner ear. If the area is inflamed, then drugs are usually prescribed to get rid of the swelling. These include diuretics, corticosteroids, steroid injections, and antiviral drugs.\n\nIf the cause of the dizziness is a bad habit, then the patient is required to change it so that it does not recur. In most cases, this change involves a simple procedure such as giving up smoking, drinking alcohol, and getting regular exercise. However, most of the time, this procedure is not enough to cure the dizziness. Thus, the patient must choose an experienced neurologist who can help in this regard.\n\n## Common Causes Of Vertigo\n\nIn many cases, the cause of vertigo is a vascular abnormality in the inner ear. Vestibular specialist can identify this issue with the help of a CT scan. This helps them to identify the exact location of the problem and start appropriate treatment. This is the reason why vestibular specialists also suggest CT scan for suspected patients", "Our body specializes in orchestrating a constant dance of balance and movement. When you\u2019re running, climbing stairs or just wandering around your neighborhood, our nerves are firing and sending signals to different parts of your body to stay upright. Without the central health connections of our nervous system, movement-especially standing up- would be difficult or impossible.\n\nIf we have a central perceived problem such as affliction of the inner ear or problems with nerve connections in the brain, the first sign we might notice is a sense of dizziness or a problem with balance. Vertigo is a hot topic in this area of medicine , but what is it exactly?\n\nVERTIGO DEFINED\n\nVertigo is the sensation of feeling \u201cdizzy,\u201d when sometimes the room seems to be spinning, even when you, in fact are not going fats and lights.\n\nThe problems often present as a sense that your surroundings are moving or spinning, that you\u2019re not upright, or that you\u2019re yourself are not standing still. You may also be giving some trouble with balance or experience this condition while sitting or laying down.\n\nVertigo can be debilitating in nature. It can last for several minutes,  hours or even several days. Doctors vary specifically in the kind of treatments they provide for this condition, so a proper diagnosis and medical evaluation are essential to get the right care.\n\nTHE EFFERENT JOINT\n\nThe Eustaing joint is an important part of the body.  It supports our neck and keeps our body upright. Sometimes this joint is sensitive or has problems, which leads to feelings of numbness and tingling and often a first firing loss from the fingers.  Treatment varies from stretching to manual adjusting of the spine joints and is an essential part of the Chiropractic Physician\u2019s arsenal in treating vertigo.\n\nCONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH VERTIGO\n\nVertigo is sometimes accompanied by other symptoms such as coughing, ear pain, or temporary brief hearing loss. Rising nausea and vomiting. Any sudden change, therefore, in the way you feel stands out. There are many associated conditions related to vertigo that you may experience in different situations.\n\n\u2022\u2022 Meniere\u2019s disease.

The problem can become worse over time.\n\nIf you are not taking your medications you are in danger of infection. You will also become resistant to the medications that you pay for.\n\nWill I get lyme disease for the first time?\n\nAlthough little is known about lyme disease prevention, the risk of contracting lyme disease is increased if you are not protected by the antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, and you are infected.\n\nHow do I know if I am protected?\n\nI develop symptoms of lyme disease at different times. Generally, a mild form of the disease may develop over a few weeks.\n\nSome people who develop a more severe form of the disease are able to develop the disease over months to years.\n\nHow do I make sure that I am protected with antibiotics?\n\nGet a blood sample to confirm the antibiotic treatment. You should never start taking antibiotics until your test results show that you are not infected.\n\nBuy an antibiotic prescription.\n\nWhenever you get treatment, get the prescription or a prescription for the medication you want. Never accept oral medication unless you know for sure that you have lyme disease.\n\nCall your doctor.\n\nIf you are not sure if your lyme disease is causing pain, ask your doctor if you have a history of a recent fever or if you have a history of painful fatigue.\n\nIf you have not had a recent fever, ask your doctor for antibiotics test results, or if antibiotic treatment is needed, they may be sent directly to you.\n\nGetting lyme disease or other tick-borne diseases is not an immediate concern for everyone. There are many other bacterial infections to treat that are more dangerous for your health.\n\nHowever, it is possible for people, especially pregnant women and the very young, to contract lyme disease in spite of antibiotic therapy.\n\nThe risk is highest during the\n\nend should somebody call me about a job, tell me? cheerleading cheerleading what is something a coach says and uh why \u2013 cheerleading 2019, cheerleading captain sign, cheerleading tryouts poleaptics united coaching staff, cheerleading tryouts inte reason ya", "Today\u2019s increased use of antibiotics is both \u201cexpected\u201d and \u201csurprising.\u201d  From the \u201cexpected\u201d viewpoint, doctors prescribed antibiotics to 114.8 million patients -- an average of 39.5 billion every year, up from 25.6 billion prescriptions filled in 1992. This has created more than 222 different opportunities for a drug to destroy good bacteria in your body, providing an environment that lyme disease pleomorphs love. Everyone loses.\n\nThe problem is that when doctors give their patients antibiotics to take care of an \"infection,\u201d they don't stop to learn if the patient has any type of allergy to that drug.  The antibiotic often kills both good and bad bacteria and also depletes the intestinal flora.\n\nA gastroenterologist specializes in treating patients with age-related bowel constipation problems.  He warned his patients to avoid most of the literally hundreds of commonly prescribed drugs that are known to cause digestive tract constipation problems.  Most patients assumed that if a doctor wants them to have a particular drug, it must be good for them, and they never questioned taking it, except in the rare situations where this digestive problem caused acute life-threatening pain and agony.\n\nMany people report their digestive problems are worse than ever now that they\u2019ve eliminated drinking alcohol.  One of the major causes is constipation that never permitted the dark colors and residue in wine to pass through.\n\nAn acquaintance told me that he was constipated all his life and feared colorectal cancer.

He was faithfully diagnosed by annual colonoscopy, but his \u201cbowel functioning is ideal,\u201d a notable change from some years back.\n\nIt is very common for lyme disease patients to have constipation.  In fact, I believe that with the chronic constipation that everyone is suffering from, it is what perhaps constitutes 99% of the chronic acetaldehyde surges that undermine innate immune homeostasis.  What happens is that each conscious constipation/splenic pause is ionized", "The best antibiotic to use for Lyme disease treatment differs depending on certain circumstances. While all cases of Lyme disease can be cured if treated right away, late-stage Lyme disease becomes much more challenging to treat.\n\nThe type of antibiotic your doctor recommends depends on factors like which bodily systems are affected and whether Lyme disease has already progressed into other conditions.\n\nRead on to learn about antibiotics commonly used to treat Lyme disease.\n\nDoctors use different types of antibiotics for Lyme disease. The particular type that\u2019s best for you depends on several factors. Here\u2019s what you should know.\n\n### Antibiotic cycles\n\nYour doctor will often recommend antibiotics in two separate cycles:\n\n- The first cycle uses oral (taken by mouth) antibiotics.\n- The second cycle uses intravenous (given by vein) antibiotics. They can be administered in your doctor\u2019s office, a hospital, or at home.\n\nThe intravenous route of administration is more effective in treating late-stage Lyme disease due to the widespread effects already occurring in your body. Oral antibiotics cannot reach all areas of inflammation.\n\n### What\u2019s going on in your body?\n\nYour doctor may also treat certain conditions that Lyme disease has caused in addition to the main Lyme disease infection. Lyme disease causes various conditions, including:\n\n- arthritis\n- carditis (heart inflammation)\n- facial nerve palsy\n- meningitis (breathing trouble, stiff neck, severe headaches, and fever)\n- neuroborreliosis, which is Lyme disease when it affects the nervous system\n\nCommon symptoms of Lyme disease include:\n\n- fever\n- fatigue\n- depression\n- irregular pulse rate\n- heart palpitations\n- shortness of breath\n- red rash\n\nYour doctor may use a combination of antibiotics depending on:\n\n- how long you\u2019ve been sick\n- which body systems are affected\n- conditions and symptoms you may have\n\nThey may recommend an antibiotic regimen consisting of several antibiotics or two doses for each antibiotic:\n\n- Once\n- Two doses of rifampin to start, then followed by more doxycycline", "This seems to be a common question among lyme literate doctors.\n\n- Do I give the patient a baby aspirin as prophylaxis?\n- Do I give the early Lyme patient doxycycline?\n- Should I give patients on fluoroquinolones or those who have extended spectrum oxacillinene type allergies Rifampin x6 days before the starting antibiotics?\n- Do I want to give patients 3 days of leftover doxycycline/celecoxib/quinolone?\n\nI think that this proverbs exist, \u201cFirst, do no Harm\u201d, is a really good place to start to answer the question about the prophylatic use of antibodics for lyme disease.  I think that we will probably never be able to make any good randomized controlled studies comparing two different treatments for early Lyme disease.\n\nFor example, we are seeing more patients who are going through chronic inflammation from complex regional pain disorder become combated to stiffness, paralyzation and worse after 4 weeks of sustained repeated prophylatic therapy with antibiotics.\n\nThis occurs commonly with fluorquinolones (leftover ceftin, doxycycline) and is above and beyond the resuscitation illness of restoring immune memory function in these patients.

The heart has to distribute this energy to various parts of the body and also keeps the circulation system warm. Obesity can cause these changes due to excess stress on the body, fluctuating heart rate and hormonal imbalances.\n\nIs obesity linked with high heart rate and blood pressure?\n\nExcess weight can lead to the pressure on the heart to pump blood more frequently. The increasing weights strain heart muscles and the left ventricular muscles are most affected because the bulk of blood is pumped from there. The walls of heart chamber tend to become thick and this entire process increases blood pressure.\n\nLowers the heart rate and blood pressure:\n\nObesity can speed up the heart rate and this increases blood pressure as heart has to work instantly. The extensive heart works for a long period due to obesity, so in order to keep it healthy lifelong, taking care of it with an effective weight loss plan is necessary. To make the heart strong and keep it healthy excess weight should be fine-tuned with quick action.\n\nSome of the effective weight loss tips cause low heart rate and blood pressure naturally:\n\n\u2022 Try not to skip any meals as hunger leads to overeating which further hampers your diet plan and causes obesity.\n\n\u2022 Eating moderately in programmed eating schedule keeps the body healthy and metabolism high.\n\n\u2022 Too much of junk foods and easy snacks promote high heart rate and blood pressure so eat plenty of fibrous and green vegetables that causes low heart rate.\n\n\u2022 Cut down on aerated beverages and sports drinks which contain lot of additives that really affects the heart condition.\n\n\u2022 A balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables comprising 60% carbohydrates, 20% protein and 20% fat is beneficial for lowering heart rate and BP naturally.\n\n\u2022 Manage excessive stress with fat burning exercises as the pressure on the heart secretly lowers down with the stress level lowering effects.\n\n\u2022 Low-fat yogurt is excellent for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol depletion.

As the blood must be pumped through more muscles, through more arteries, through larger bodies in general, which takes extra effort. But also, along with the larger body is a larger heart. As such, the energy given to it will have influence on the effort of pumping blood. (This is why bigger machines use more electrical current to run them.)\n\nThere are some other problems with high heart rate. Firstly, the heart has to work extra fast when at such speed. Blood should be most frequently (not permanently) pumped through body, like a few minutes usually after meals or even sleep (which would kind of like body shutting down, but we keep living through self-circulation), then settling down, the heart just gets a rest in periods of relaxation, through the help of blood-stocking body catheter. When this heart are pumping all the time, the work on the muscles may be made (if it happens) during the heart curtain.\n\nThese interruptions of activities may require more energy. And, sadly, this means higher blood pressure. The heart feels nervous and jumps all over the place, on and off it will go.\n\nUnexpectedly, high heart rate can make extremeties cool down. In modern history, high heart rate was compared to the room temperature and Northern Europeans would have, although tropical or desert weather experienced by people from such countries could be expected to as much, since blood thinner means the body\u2019s core temperature stabilizes at lower rate and this normalizes blood pressure, is as simple as morning temperature and that of the afternoon are arrange as usual, because sweat cools them down.", "Last seen on Felt nuzzling Shereck\nWrite news : 16:23:46 01/03/2019\n\nIn fact, people pay attention to heart health issues like heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure, as well as Weight gain, excessive heat rate, fatigue, dry mouth, cessation of sweating, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, etc., but heart rate is also a decisive and extremely important factor.\n\nFan Tang, director of the cardiology department of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, says that a heart rate of more than 80 basal per minute is the danger warning signal of coronary heart disease.

His normal heart rate is almost between 80 and 100 basal, and the maximum is as high as 180, almost twice the resting heart rate. His resting heart rate should be below 40 to maintain normal. In a few days, the heart rate adjustment work has slowly kicked in. His heart rate has been lower than 100 basal since then, but his blood pressure has dropped significantly, which won't work in the short term.\n\nGu Yunxiang, Director of the Cardiovascular Department of Zhongshan Hospital, said that when there is no strict protection for the heart, the heart rate will rise or come to a wrap, because the heart rate is directly proportional to the metabolism of the heart, which can eventually cause coronary heart disease and is a fatal danger warning.

{"Question": "Would you recommend something a bit stronger than meloxicam?", "Free_form_answer": "There are generally three main types of drugs used for pain management: acetaminophen (paracetamol), NSAIDs (like Meloxicam), and opioids.

Opioids such as Tramadol (Conzip) and Oxycodone (Oxyado, Oxycontin) are the most potent but carry a significant risk of addiction, toxicity, and cognitive and respiratory adverse effects. In case of acute and severe pain, NSAIDs like Meloxicam are often recommended.

And of course, the collars were originally necessary, as they're greater-than-average escape artists/their retainers are full of hoes... we're working on that. Hopefully the collar situation will be resolved within the next couple of weeks, but you understand what I'm getting at. The tags are a bit different, they're indispensable.\nToday, on Monday, October 22nd, MyDog and I attended our desert-area hardware-store in preparation for beginning to plan my office remodel to take place in a couple of years. The pallet of gypsum board was delivered ahead of schedule; I have arrangements to sell the rest of the stuff. MyDog and I brought this gigantic bag of sandy-dust from underneath that newly delivered pallet of gypsum board to fill the tubs, and I know, from experience, that my dogs will fawn over this stuff. Seriously - they consider dry and sandy to be uniform states of excellence.\nMyDog knows how to behave dressed the way she is.\n\nAt one point, I hustled down to to kitchen to pour a couple more glasses of water, Oscar says that he can't find her. It's only some three feet away. At first, I thought that Milkbone jeans was underneath something - she was. He was standing there with neither a clue nor an idea. What he did have, was doggie pyrex shards. One of the dug-out two-thirds or so of the side-angled walls were being obliterated by a foremost very-shaky doggie ash-pan.\nI took fifteen very carefully selected shards of torso-sized japchae, and went to each of them. I waded in, in a t-shirt and shorts. Each one of them - a singleton. They stood there, and drank their water.\nIsic was none-the-wiser, but then again he wouldn't have known had I been buried.\nThere was a very concrete and very egregious litter box training issue", "Ruth\n\nI don't prescribe these kinds of drugs, but I'm told that meloxicam is relatively weak, with arthritic pets like your lurcher often taking additional painkillers, some of which I believe are still banned in some countries, like buffered aspirin.\n\nHow can I get my cat to have his teeth cleaned by a vet? Claire\n\nCan't she be anaesthetised alone without the teeth cleaning to fit some stitches? It can easily be done as a separate procedure another day.\n\nAnecdotally, we know that cats are less likely to have bad breath than dogs, and my feeling is that prioritising teeth cleaning is overrated. Can you train your vet to accept smell is normal? Perhaps most important of all, remember that the cat doesn't know that you're trying to help. They probably don't like the taste of their toothpaste. Feline periodontal disease, when caught early, usually results in a healthy and happy cat.\n\nWe are moving just before Christmas, should we quarantine our cats? Maria\n\nIt will be necessary to quarantine our own cat when we move house. Our new home has a shared lawn that backs onto neighbours' homes, and this year we've just cared more about keeping our own pets safe. My feeling is that the greater danger of potential rabies from wild birds, such as magpies and crows, reduces the importance of ensuring your unvaccinated cat doesn't lose his or her immune response (especially in regions where it's over-reliant on public health services to pick up additional rabies cases, and tests are free). It's also relatively easy to avoid vaccinating your cat, in parts of the UK at least.\n\nOur existing cat and kitten network doesn't allow for offending over-exposure.

First of all, we all need to know the basic facts about the disease. Only that way will we be able to protect ourselves.\n\nMost of us know that herpes progresses in stages. In the first stage the virus gets carried into our body through the starting point \u2013 the open sores on the skin, mucous membranes, or the pathways that carry these substances into the body, like the mouth or genital opening.\n\nThen, in the second stage, the virus migrates to the central nervous system, where it establishes a permanent home \u2013 the ganglia. That also explains why after the initial bout of herpes cold sores took so long to return..\n\nIn the third and final stage, the virus crosses from the ganglia back to the original entry point through the nerve endings .Once the virus crosses the nerve endings, the virus travels back to the original site through the lymphatic system. I know it was enough for me to vomit just with that information, so give yourself a minute before going any further!!!\n\nWell, this is the actual progression of the disease.\n\nThe virus can find it\u2019s way to the ganglia through at least three pathways. One of them is possible initial exposure through contact\u2013for example, when the mouth or the eye comes into contact with the hands of an already infected person. This requires direct contact.

It depends on your immune system and genetics. Also, different strains of Chlamydia infect different people and everyone\u2019s immune system is different.\n\nWhat\u2019s your thought?\n\nPS. sorry you had to go through this! Hope you\u2019re now doing well.\n\nThere\u2019s alot they don\u2019t tell you about chlamydia because they wanna find a permanent cure but that infection which i got as my first sex encounter happens on that and stick to that person probably women.

Apparently I read in books that one in four women who have had untreated chlamydia can get a bad case of pelvic pains, see pus, see burning.\n\nIs PID permanent?\n\nAnswerYes and they do cause permanent damage in some cases. PID however, is not a permanent infection. You can get treated and follow antibiotic protocol and the symptoms will go away. IF you have double blockage meaning both fallopian tubes are blocked then you might have permanent damage. Otherwise, if you just have blockage in one fallopian tube then you will be fine. You can have one tube and still carry a child without having complications. There was a woman close to me who had that happen.

How, and why?\n\nHow WISE they say the more knowledge\n\n1 - some doctors do NOT do vaginal swabs on girls, they do urine samples instead, which can be inaccurate -- young teen girls who are still having periods need special help from the doctor to get STD's properly tested, in an appropriate way involving experienced doctor and saucepan pads\n\n2 -- unless girls use protection like condoms then within the period of PMS or first month post-period they are haemorrhaging i.e. the are are bleeding internally from the cervix, so any growth (eg bacteria) is healthy & able to survive & MAY proliferate.

It works by drawing fluid out of tissues and absorbing it and leaving a layer of powder. It is an effective first aid treatment in the prevention of blistering and the subsequent treatment of minor blisters or surface skin irritations brought about by edema within clothing, subjected to localized pressure, heat etc. which may result in maceration and maceration eczema and occurs in the tropics and hot humid environments. It also has the ability to keep wounds clean in the external environment. It is suitable for topical use on healthy uninfected tissue. It draws moisture faster and more effectively from both the surface of the skin, from basic blisters as well as infection. Flotrol is effective in soaking up existing blisters due to extended exposure to heat and/or pressure, keeping them from popping. Flotrol rapidly dries up corns, calluses, decubiti, scabs and small cuts wounded tissue exposing only a light powder coating. It is especially useful on blistering or painful sensitivities where hot water is not recommended or possible. Flotrol is effective for treating skin damaged by Maceration; a buildup of sap or protective elements within the surface of the skin and maceration eczema, irritation of the skin caused by malnutrition, prolonged exposure to a hot humid environment, items of warm and restrictive clothing such as a rubber gloves or boots and even from chafing and friction injuries. Only a level of application equal to a dusting is required. Keep dry, avoid wetting, not for eye application.\n\n### Legal In The", "Hello Hazel:\n\nWhat you describe sounds a lot like blepharitis. The redness in one eye, the crusty matter and the feeling of wanting to constantly rub the eyes would all be consistent with an upper lid or lower lid blepharitis. Normally there would be no discharge, but some people seem to product discharge as a result of blepharitis. I would speak with your eye doctor to go over what is happening. If your doctor finds nothing else after a careful examination, you might consider a short course of a good antibiotic ointment that you could apply to the eye lid margin twice each day to see if that helps.\n\nHello Hazel:\n\nIt would be unusual for a corneal abrasion to produce a discharge but your red eye may be the result of irritating material like a tiny hair or eyelash. These irritants tend to be produced from rubbing the eye with your fingers or when cleaning the eye with a cotton swab. Aside from an eye examination, the best way to determine a true corneal abrasion from something you might have out of your eye is for your eye doctor to stain the front of your eye with a special dye such as fluorescein.

I wasn't allergic, but had some scalp sensitivity so used a different product.\n\nAn exacerbation of psoriasis should be different from contact dermatitis.

Vaginal bacteria are natural in your body, and the correct number and mixture of bacteria keep infections at bay. When the microorganisms fail to balance, BV can occur. This infection causes an overgrowth of bacteria and a few stands out. Those bacteria at a high level are named Gardnerella, Atopobium and Mobiluncus. As intrusive as this disease it does have some symptoms.\n\nMany of the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are not as fatal as the disease in of itself. The first thing is that there might be a fishy smell coming from your private parts. This one is rather unique. Women will even describe a readily foul odor below the skin. Another symptom is a milky and gray vaginal discharge. This can also be accompanied by a burning sensation during urination or sex.\n\nThese symptoms might seem jarring but they are not as fatal as someone might believe. As we mentioned earlier, these are illnesses that were so very common in the past. Women suffered through these symptoms all through history. You are not the first woman who has to deal with this condition.\n\nIs BV an STD?\n\nThere is a good chance you already did the research yourself. The symptoms might ring a bell and you might even feel as if you\u2019ve had this before. No worries, you haven\u2019t read your whole diagnosis. When people ask me if bacterial vaginosis is an STD, the answer is pretty straightforward. Unfortunately, No is not the answer. BV is not exactly an STD but it is contracted through sex.\n\nIt\u2019s not really considered an STI (sexually transmitted infection). Still, it can spread by anal, oral, or vaginal between a man and a woman, or between two women (anal or vaginal). The main reason is that some women get it only after getting lacerations or abrasions from sex in the first place.\n\nThe most common myth related to bacterial vaginosis is that it is simply caused by having sex with a new partner. As we said before that is completely false. Not to mention there is a lot more sexual", "Bacterial Vaginosis or BV is the most common cause of vaginal infection in females, as reported by the World Health Organization. It is a condition that is caused by flagellated, rod-shaped microbes known as anaerobic bacteria.\n\nThese bacteria thrive in an environment with limited air flow, which in this case, is in the vagina. The excess bacteria in the vagina throws off the chemical balances inside the vaginal cavity, leading to several discomforts due to the imbalance.\n\nThe typical symptoms of Bacterial Vaginosis are vaginal discharge, irritation, and itching. The color of the discharge is white and causes a fishy odor, which can be embarrassing, especially during sexual intercourse.\n\nBacterial Vaginosis can be passed from one person to another through the sexual contact, but according to the Mayo Clinic, it is a sexually transmitted disease as it is categorized as not being the result of the single sexual partner, or is it spread by only one single sexual contact.\n\nIn other words, you can transmit the condition itself to others even when you have not been infected by another partner.\n\nBV is usually treated with antibiotics like Metronidazole or Clindamycin or sometimes treatment might be done by home remedies like following a dry vagina diet and reduce stress.\n\nHowever, if you do not use protection during sexual intercourse after being treated for BV, you are more prone to be affected again.", "Infections vary in symptoms and those signs are usually attributed to multiple situations. Some symptoms may even be invisible for a long time. As such, the advancement of infections might even happen for months without you aware of it.\n\nOne condition, known as bacterial vaginosis, can often mystery. It may appear and then vanish in your body for every single cycle. Even though a bacterial vaginosis can arrive in and disappear, it\u2019s still contagious to the extent that you be prompted to employ precautionary measures to avoid spreading it to others. To become relieved of the discomfort as well as fast, it is important to understand this condition in full detail.\n\nBacterial Vaginosis Defined\n\nBasis the \u201ctextbook\u201d definition, BV is a well-recognized infection of females\u2019 genitals caused by changing range of bacteria that colonize the genital canal. Even if it is a painful problem, it may cause bacteria that is far will bear results so severe that it should be treated medically. The bad fact is that bacterial vaginosis is usually not, but there are situations where they\u2019d be a requisite to find in-outpatient treatment.\n\nSigns of BV\n\nAs earlier said, basic symptoms of BV aren\u2019t generally bad enough to bother you or contact a physician \u2013 at least you aren\u2019t looking for BV. The thing is that they often represent common issues, such as:\n\n\u2013 change in a vaginal hostess, often involving unusual vibrancy, odor, or perhaps texture,\n\n\u2013 pain during intercourse,\n\n\u2013 itching, pain, or burning throughout or if the the labia or vula\n\n\u2013 an unexpected discharge that thins into a sort of unusual foul odor.\n\nBV Looks Easy to Identify?\u2026No.\n\nIdentification of BV may be a caveat for researchers not only. The thing is that BV can actually be the result of many several other signs. Just as clear: cough, bad breath, and others may be nothing more than a signal of a completely different tangible situation.\n\nExactly the same may always apply to BV. That\u2019s why it\u2019s something that should be dated very carefully, especially if you\u2019d like to solve the problem.

If you take a medication then please ensure you check the leaflet of this to ensure that is not the cause of your symptoms.\n\nHow long does Imodium last?\n\n- The effects of Imodium begin within one hour.", "- Yes, so long a you do not use it daily. It can be used both weekly or monthly depending on your symptoms.\n\nI only take it a few times here and there when I have some symptoms. I use mag 0 before I take it just to make sure that my digestion is not too bad. If it is still bad after I take the Immodium I make sure that I do not take it the day after unless my symptoms get worse.

I also decreased my gluten, and reduced the quantity of fiber I\u2019m taking in.\n\nOver the last few months, i\u2019ve decimated and paused the imodium at times, while at times taking it daily. I have an appointment this next week to speak to my physician about the where to buy a place to buy imodium online. Finally, surprisingly, as of three days ago my diarrhea has decreased drastically. In Little new things have been introduced at this time except 1- that my family has been crunched with sicknesses with my baby being very sick with a respiratory thing, which has been very stressful on everyone (we usually keep illnesses out of the house) it has been very stressful on everyone (we usually keep illnesses out of the house). So I\u2019m guardedly optimistic about my improved GI,\n\nIt should be noted my endocrinologist had me on Amitiza a couple of years ago (about 10 mg) with limited success. Part of his original feeling was that perhaps my GI was just too slow generally. This is now worth mention.\n\nI\u2019m assuming the imodium is why my GI has finally calmed down. While I know imodium isn\u2019t a long term solution, it has been helpful as others have answered Your questions on why I\u2019ve used it to help while GI hasn\u2019t calmed down as much.\n\nAs I hope to find with others with this ongoing at issue with this medication, does one person\u2019s body just handle an antidiarrheal better than another\u2019s? To my knowledge i\u2019ve got no damaged GI issues (certainly with this recent upswing in GI)\n\nI\u2019ve used Immodium over and over since the late 1980\u2019s, so it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t used the drug and I\u2019ve never had severe side effects to it.

I have no idea why your vet prescribed that particular PPI but I wouldn't recommend it on my dog food either! I have used 5 separate brands of OTC Omeprazole/Prilosec over the years - the one called Famotidine worked great for my old Golden and used to rub it between my fingers and then use on my Lab's food bowls. Hope this might be helpful!\n\nKeep trying the old Acevets \u00ae chewable H2. Just a small fraction of a pill lets you get it into him bite after bite like peanut butter (our dog loved it). I know some of the other posters find this med difficult to get Goldens to take, but Moses wouldn't touch anything but this form. I would suggest you find other dogs who liked it, and see if you can borrow some of their old ones to crush up and get down to him.\n\nAnd chilakip, while I would like to see far fewer drugs used routinely in situations where they can be avoided, the jury is still out on the real consequences of long-term use of PPIs as brain tumors in Golden's. Far more studies are needed on that idea.\n\nSomething else you did not ask about: Have you considered trying Zaroxolyn? It is a diuretic that also prevents blood acidity by increasing urination.

You will get to know and understand the difference between the two terms. Before we jump into the difference article, let us understand what are hemorrhoids and fissures.\n\n## Hemorrhoids\n\nBefore I leaned that chronic constipation led to hemorrhoids. And it is confirmed that I have hemorrhoids. I went in Amazon to search for some books. There I got a book about hemorrhoids where I came to know what hemorrhoids are and how they are caused. But the definition of hemorrhoids from the internet is very brief. I quote from Wikipedia.\n\n> \u201cHemorrhoids (HM or HAE; also known as a pile or hemmorhoid,^{[1]} plural hemorrhoids or haemorrhoids, and usually referred to simply as piles) are swollen veins that bulge outward from from inside or the skin surrounding the anus. Sometimes elastic fibers of the condition prevent blood from returning to the thorax and the veins distend so that the hemorrhoid varicose vein forming a lump similar to that formed by varicose veins elsewhere. Usually we do not pay any attention to them but when the swelling becomes large and thus, starts itching then we assume it is hemorrhoids.\u201d\n\nTo make it more easy let\u2019s consider it like thrombosis.\n\nFor the sake of understanding, we need to learn some basic concepts.\n\nAnus: Tube of skin, muscles, and membrane that notes down as the lowest portion of your bowel and which juts out away from your rectum, there are specific muscles, nerves, membranes, and veins there.\n\nInternal Hemorrhoids: In this type of hemorrhoids, the squeeze that becomes thrombosed is inside the anus and it does not cause any discomfort except itches less often. However, you will feel the blood.\n\nExternal Hemorrhoids: In this type, the bleed you feel is the blood clot pressed against the base of your anus. This one is treated by surgery.\n\nIn other words, piles are swollen veins inside or external to the anus. Sometimes the veins tissue of the anus swells", "WikiTherapy explains the difference in their causes, symptoms, and medical treatment options.\n\n## Definition: Fissure\n\nSkin fissure is a longitudinal cut across the anal canal (fissure-in-ano) which causes severe pain during defecation, recalling genital herpes (wounds that can be situated at any distance between the anal sphincter). A fistula, on the contrary, is a path that occurs between the bowel and the skin to the anal canal, and it is defined as a visible opening.\n\nFissures vouch for anal pain, discomfort and the external opening vouch for purulent discharges accompanied by itching.\n\nDifferent agencies have used different definitions as well and this is why there is always a question that keeps on coming back that the prevalence rates are so widely different.\n\n## Definition: Hemorrhoids\n\nis venous congestion or easy engorgement of the veins of the lower bowel. There is chronic arterial stasis as well and oozing of hemoglobin in the stool sometimes as well. They grow inside the walls of the three rigid fissures of the Lower Bowel \u2013 two located inside the abdominal can and one is the pedicle Carson at the outer end. Many people experience this \u2018pile\u2019 as a \u2018hemorrhoid.\u2019\n\nThere is pain around the anal area and perianally and, there is not a single organ function that might be interfered by piles mild, moderate or severe.\n\nLike any other vascular disorder veins and arteries of the lower bowel are also pulled or pushed away from their resting position and get disrupted on a steady increase in on pressure inside.\n\n## Table 1.

The term \u2018kidney stone\u2019 \u2013 or renal calculus) is generally used to refer to:\n\n- Calcium stones, which form from calcium in your urine under certain circumstances\n- Uric acid stones\n- Struvite stones\n\nI guess it depends on the general condition of your kidneys and what the stones are made of.\n\nIf you simply have a deposit (as in a previous question) in your kidney, then a urine test won\u2019t pick it up. But if it\u2019s a kidney stone that is obstructing the flow of urine INTO your kidney then a test will.\n\nThere are also experiments showing that testing urine with a urinalysis can raise awareness in people regarding possible urinary tract infection.
