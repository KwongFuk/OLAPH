{"text": "Question: What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease? \n ### Answer: Polycyctic kidney disease is a component of Mallory-Weiss syndrome in the Pweb group. Significant renal cysts occur in up to 24 to 30% of individuals with Noonan syndrome and provide a characteristic feature. Individuals with large renal cysts appear to have the most typical features of Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome and polycystic disease (PCKD) have some degree of overlap, and a few members of the Pweb class, have been discovered with PCKD. Some sporadic instances of NL syndrome with excessive renal cysts are described in the literature. These people display a polycystic kidney phenotype, on occasion combined with polycystic liver disease, in addition to the other NL features. The majority of these cases were found in families confirming autosomal dominant inheritance. An NL syndrome displaying a polycystic kidney phenotype can serve as an easily understood syndrome aided by autosomal dominant transmission, large multi-cystic round kidneys, renal failure post-juvenile, hearing loss, lentigines, short stature, and pulmonary stenosis. In the clinical simulation, distinctive people described for the polycystic kidney disease exhibited a relative absence of lentigines compared to other NL spectrum disorders. A member of the MIR17HG locus recently identified for autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome, causing deafness, renal system disease, unusual facial appearance, and short stature in individual, also studied for recurring cases of PCKD accompanying NLS.

{"text": "Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients? \n ### Answer: All persons with acute syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent) should be treated with intramuscular procaine penicillin as follows: 2.4 MU (6 MU for penicillin-sensitive persons). Treatment of patients with ECDC-defined primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis would be 1 dose of benzathine penicillin (2.4 MU given IM) if 24 STC or more are present in any organ sites. Untreated syphilis can be transmitted to others by sexual contact. Avoid being sexually active for 1 incubation period after treatment.

{"text": "Question: Can the administration of anesthesia, during hip replacement surgery, have any negative cognitive effects, especially on patients demonstrating FXTAS? \n ### Answer: This question arises because human genetic diseases are more prevalent, and surgical procedures are increasingly performed that contain high doses of anesthetics, such as arthroplasty. Hence, emphasis has been placed in recent years on finding methods and strategies to help anesthesiologists monitor patients with these diseases to reduce as much as possible any risk of negative events during and after their surgery. In addition, evidence is accumulating that the administration of anesthetics to symptomatic patients with fragile X conditions can negatively affect cognitive performance. For example, Young et al. (1999) found that the full range of anesthesia affect the antioxidative system in the hip putamen of FXTAS patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which anesthesia induces the onset of this disease and the way in which specific anesthetics interact together to influence FXS clinical phenotypes, and especially to clarify the role of the middle cerebral artery anomaly in the expression of FXTAS."}

{"text": "Question: Is uveitis an autoimmune disease? \n ### Answer: The answer is not simple. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the intraocular tissues (the uvea) and is traditionally classified as either anterior or posterior. An immune system\u2013centered approach to the classification of inflammatory disorders termed autoimmune disease is characterized by inflammation of tissues caused by self-antigens.1 These self-antigens can be organs or tissues (i.e., type I diabetes affecting the pancreas). Extrinsic or environmental factors that can act as mono- or polyantigens2 triggering the adaptive system are called triggers (smoking or anti-glaucoma drugs). In patients with uveitis, multiple factors often contribute to the initiation and progression of disease. The specific etiology of a patient's uveitis is highly dependent on age, gender, race, genetic inheritance, and whether or not it is associated with any systemic autoimmune rheumatological disorder."}

{"text": "Question: What are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Are there long-term pulmonary sequelae? Can marrying your cousin cause this? \n ### Answer: ANSWER: There are numerous possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, some as insignificant as a \u201chole\u201d in the membrane that occurred during the early stages of your baby's development. If congenital diaphragmatic hernia is present during fetal life, there will be a reduction in lung volume and a rightward shift of the mediastinum. Potential long-term complications may include decreased lung functioning and pulmonary hypertension (elevated blood pressure in part of the lungs). There are several diseases in which diaphragmatic hernias may occur, including those with reduced formation of the diaphragm, such as Prune Belly Syndrome and Jeune Syndrome, as well as others in which the weakness of the diaphragm results from poor closure after the structures separate. Factual congenital diaphragmatic hernia does not cause the diseases themselves, but there may be a genetic link between them. While the incidence is higher in certain races, for example, children of Spanish or French Canadian descent have a notably higher risk (11.3 per 10,000 births), congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in all ethnicities. HOWEVER, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are both associated with neurofibromatosis, a hereditary condition frequently caused by a lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Therefore, if you have caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, you may want to have your genes tested to see if they have a similar genetic basis. Genetic counseling will be important for individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia during preconception, conception, gestation, birthing, and in the postnatal period."}

But there are many more doctors who do not come from the functional medicine perspective (not basing diagnosis on a search for leaky gut or other functional imbalances). Such doctors would generally advise avoiding high intensity intensity exercise (which is a heart strain, rather than lung strain, as the maximum asthmatic ventilation is on a steady basis) and controlling asthma is difficult and stubborn then the advice would be about mechanisms, principles, etc. They may advise exercises, specific gym equipment/exercises, limiting the type and duration especially for those of severe asthma.

{"text": "Question: Is fildena like viagra and how does it work? \n ### Answer: Fildena is a popular ED medication drug used to treat erectile dysfunction disorder. Fildena is presumed to activate the nitric oxide synthase and increase the release of nitric oxide. Fildena leads to increased levels of cGMP, especially in the penile tissues. This facilitates smooth muscle relaxation in the penile tissues, increased blood flow in the penile region, simultaneous erection, and reduces the painful feeling while having sex, especially for older men."}

{"text": "Question: Can low dose naltrexone be used to treat severe depression? \n ### Answer: Studies have shown a relation between major depression and a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and a few have shown that patients with major depression have less dopamine D2 receptors (122\u2013124). In cell culture, low doses (1 nM) of naltrexone suppressed the degradation of norepinephrine and relieved depression without affecting signaling at the mu opioid receptor (67). This suggests that low doses of naltrexone may even be effective for people with a low density of mu opioid receptors in treatment resistant depression. Further studies are needed to determine whether low dose naltrexone can be used safely and effectively in these cases."}

{"text": "Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal? \n ### Answer: Hantavirus is a virus that can cause hemorrhagic fever. Whilst these illnesses are generally severe, they can mostly be treated in hospital. On rare occasions, however, the infection can lead to a more serious illness called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and is commonly fatal if left untreated. This syndrome occurs throughout the world and most hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents. In the UK, for example, there is an isolated population of bank voles on Brownsea Island in Southampton. People who visit or live on Brownsea can become infected with a hantavirus called Seoul virus (which causes fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and a rash) from infected voles. Some infected individuals may then develop hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and lymphocytic meningoencephalitis - a serious illness of the lungs and brain."}
{"text": "Question: Is there always an elevated temperature associated with appendicitis? \n ### Answer: We all agree to the fact that rise of body temperature is an ultimate sign of an ongoing inflammation and during acute infectious disease. It\u2019s quite noteworthy that there is a lack of enough clinical data about fever prevalence among patients admitted with suspected appendicitis due to the misdiagnosis of this entity . The level of fever was reported to range between 36\u00b71-38\u00b75\u00b0C and could reach even 41\u00b0C [, , ]. Furthermore, the occurrence of macroscopic purulent peritoneal exudate is not an everyday phenomenon as some researchers present serious concerns about the difficult identification of purulent collection especially in case of detection in the post-operative period. It may be confusing with applying suspicious intra-abdominal hypertension or specific disease and predictive tests of complicated appendicitis such as CT-scan [4,, , , ]. So, in a large proportion of patients with acute appendicitis, the absence of established risk factors for complicated disease may be contributing to the diagnostic \u201cnoise\u201d to prove an urgent indication for laparoscopy or laparotomy. In many instances, using more sensitive indicators to predict severe appendicitis could have prevented many forms of unnecessary tests. MFA is a predictor of acute severe appendicitis, and correct selection of the appropriate imaging modality for surgery or treatment guided by repeat image-guided reassessment specially CT-scan might be preventive. Considering that CT-scan allows necessary invasive intervention compared to the traditional option such as ultrasound scan."}

The condition is usually diagnosed through amniocentesis, or with noninvasive prenatal screening in the first trimester.Karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization are both diagnostic modalities for trisomy 13."}
{"text": "Question: To what extent is quinine in seltzer water effective in treating leg cramps? \n ### Answer: Commercial seltzer water was evaluated for its quinine content. The solution prepared by the manufacturer was consistent in its quinine level (approximately 50 mg/L) over several weeks. Small quantities of the solution were used to treat 1 patient at a time to minimize wastage. The number of bottles needed was relatively low, and seltzer water is inexpensive and easy to find. Furthermore, because it can be self-administered and is easy to carry, seltzer water is more convenient to use as a treatment than other methods (e.g., oral quinine tablets, lotions, or solutions). No severe adverse effects were found for intramuscular injections or quinine lotions. Whereas lotion applications are messy, intramuscular injections are painful, and seltzer water provided a rapid response most similar to that of intramuscular injections than to that of lotions.2,9 Finally, seltzer water can help mitigate the side effects of oral quinine. (It should be noted that when oral quinine and seltzer water are used, they should not mix as they can cause severe vomiting.)Limitations of the technology and disseminationRegulatory concernsRegulations regarding the use of quinine for GI preventative indication vary across the countries, limiting attempts to pass formal legislation for this indication. For example, in the United States, data and protocols were reviewed by the principal regulatory body, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for as many as 15 years with the goal of approving quinine for use as an antiemetic. However, the FDA impeded the approval process. Despite the requirement for a worksheet explaining the foams, no official decision was made. For multijurisdictional approval, the agency explicitly stated that there was no interested party supporting the marketing of the product. Although routine consultation was continued over the years between European Union agencies, they were unable to pass regulations without the support of the FDA. Use of quinine to prevent GI-related and other forms of vomiting remains banned in the United States.Although seltzer water may be more convenient and less costly for use to prevent an attack of cramps given that much less drug is needed than by using quinine infusion, the fastest approach is still the patient\u2019s"}

{"text": "Question: What is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? \n ### Answer: MNT formularies, with different tolerability and side effect profiles, form the basis of guidelines for choosing an optimal hypoglycaemic drug. Current ADA, ADA/EASD and other guidelines suggest starting a patient with MNT once it has failed. The question thus is what is the maximum dose of metformin A patient can take with adequate safety profile? We find roughly six guidelines, and there is real diversity of opinion. Should they be all condemned as incompetent practices or there are some scientific grounds present for each of the guidelines? Various guidelines suggest metformin's daily dose (if increased from initial dose) should be based on number of glucose-lowering drugs prescribed, age of the patient, kidney function and diabetes duration (bracketing increased risk of lactic acidosis). These guidelines are also based on various studies that have at some point or other tried to establish the maximum metformin dose on the basis of LAB (doto)."}

This is responsible for the majority of clinical symptoms of KTS.Cardinal findings in KTS include hyperplasia of skin and soft tissue, musculoskeletal deformity, lymphatic malformations, and ocular complications.Genetic linkage has not been definitively established for KTS. Results of many previous studies seemed to show that the majority of KTS patients were genetically predisposed to the condition. Familial occurrence ranges from 3% to 22%. Recessive and dominant inheritance have been suggested but neither theory adequately explains the wide variety of affected body parts.Surgical therapies may include angiographic embolization and wide surgical excision.Suggested treatment includes physical therapy, exercise, and attention to posture to help prevent contractures.Individual treatment must be limited according to unique characteristics of KTS patients.Recommendation for treatment should be individually tailored to the child and their specific presentation.Patient-centered communication and parent involvement with treatment plan are imperative for optimal development and wellbeing."}

{"text": "Question: What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C (a genetic change) Issues and long term prognosis? \n ### Answer: Regarding the long-term prognosis, we should consider several factors as a whole. These include, but not limited to, the genetic background; environmental factors such as smoking, coffee, and alcohol; low folate intake; and manners related to the disease and its treatment. MTHFR is a gene that can influence the process of folate metabolism. Homozygous mutations in this gene is known to cause a significant decrease in the level of activity of the gene. Some studies have shown that homozygous MTHFR A1298C has increased cancer rate. However, the majority of research shows that it has no certain impact on long-term prognosis, and unlike some other genetic changes, it cannot impact life expectancy. Homozygous MTHFR A1298C has some effect on increasing the risk of some diseases in some patients. It has increased risk of cancers such as folic acid deficiency and cervical cancer , and in other studies, its association with pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , and colorectal cancer  have been reported. Aside from cancerous diseases, homozygous MTHFR A1298C has also been linked to C677T polymorphism  and other diseases such as MTHFR A1298CC/C677TT which is a determinant of ischemic stroke . As can be seen, the effects of MTHFR A1298C mutation are not limited to a single aspect, and this extends to recurrent pregnancy loss. 5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) A1298C mutation has some effect on the recurrent pregnancy loss, but the extent to which this mutation affects it, and what other factors play a role in this condition are factors that need to be considered in these cases . 5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation has shown an increased risk of pregnancy loss. Based on several studies, a mixed mutation of the homozygous MTHFR A1298C and C677T mutation has had no relation to pregnancy termination.  Nevertheless, there are studies that have shown an increased association between"}

{"text": "Question: What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body? \n ### Answer: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body\u2019s immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This results in a lack of insulin, which is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes typically develops in children or young adults, but it can also occur in older adults. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and age. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and can develop at any age, but it is more common in older adults. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It typically resolves after pregnancy, but women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life."}

{"text": "Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.? \n ### Answer: In fact, TG is the coenzyme (not cofactor) that carries electrons from NADH to Oxidized LDL cholesterol/ferricyanide to reduce ferricin+ electrons to ferrocyanide (hypoxanthine). TG is required at approximately a 3:1 ratio to cholesterol. The lower the TGs then the lower the Oxidized LDL C cholesterol potential to damage the vascular endothelium is, although what is termed oxidized LDL C is considerably less likely to cause vascular damage than coagulated Lipoproteins with Phospholipids (VLDL and LDL) as well as Activated MacroPhages due to the largely elevated levels of PAI-1. PAI-1 over being produced in the liver by activated hepatic stellate cells, is an important wound clotting factor that plasmalogens can prevent coagulation of Lipoproteins, and thus vascular occlusion-causing thrombotic occlusions are almost entirely preventable from those factors that are phospholipid-dependent."}
{"text": "Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit? \n ### Answer: It is known that calcium supplements can cause the urine to become very alkaline and that calcium crossing the kidney epithelial cell with this degree of alkalinity results in extracellular calcium (hard) deposits in the kidney. We have suggested that the addition of magnesium to supplements was useful to prevent calcium deposits in the sub-endothelial space. To date, it is unknown if calcium supplementation with magnesium is more effective than calcium alone, and definitive studies addressing this question will likely take years to complete. Therefore, we would suggest that individuals with osteoporosis or who are at higher risk for osteoporosis receive concurrent magnesium along with their calcium supplements, until the optimal use of magnesium in supplements can be judged in large clinical trials."}

{"text": "Question: Can chronic cervicitis cause infertility? Why would tampons cause inflammation? \n ### Answer: Was scarring from previous procedures causative? Timing and presence of sexually transmitted infections continue to confound reports, despite medical intervention (Delaney and Sullivan, 1999). As much as half of T. vaginalis burden is asymptomatic (Passman, 1983; Rosenbaum et al., 2002). Biopsies, Pap smears, and culture rely on active infection of vaginal and cervical mucosa and poor sampling of large bodies of vaginal secretions. Does infection delay a woman\u2019s reproductive life? Co-infections with pathogens complicate studies of the role of T. vaginalis in sperm dysfunction. The solitary progenitor of T. vaginalis originated from a parasitically breeding algae before evolving (Anderson et al., 1995). Do environmental conditions influence pathogenicity? These questions, motivating bench research for decades lack answers. Researchers must understand Trichomonas cellular mechanisms, development under in vitro culture environments mimicking human hosts, and how an early transition from aqueous to nutrient compromised conditions may have compromised Trichomonas fitness under such conditions. Greater understanding may lead to novel prevention methods or genetic modifications to reduce pathogenicity."}

The results will help provide better evidence on whether metformin leads to an increase in blood pressure. Nevertheless, it seems that long-term metformin treatment less than first-line treatment with sulfonylureas does not significantly increase the incidence of hypertension. Additionally, metformin use has been recently associated with an improvement in BP among people with obesity without diabetes, a finding which if confirmed could provide a rationale for an anti-hypertensive effect for metformin."}

{"text": "Question: What are the effects of smoking and/or nicotine on the digestive system? \n ### Answer: Cigarette smoke has a detrimental effect on stomach function and can affect dryness of the mouth. It in addition has an effect on the digestion of carbohydrates and lipids, thereby rendering hepatocytes more susceptible to inflammation . Nicotine may reduce gastrointestinal motility, which may increase the risk for constipation . Smoking may also alter the activity of orexins, possibly contributing to obesity . What is the effect of smoking/nicotine on the colon/rectum? Cigarette smoke condensate has been found to have a carcinogenic and a colonotoxic effect on the rectal mucosa . These findings are not in favor of smoking on colon cancer or colorectal polyps although data is actually lacking . Yet there is also remarkably little research on the direct effect of nicotine on colon cancer . How does smoking/nicotine affect immune cells in the digestive tract? It is conceivable that immune cells in the gut are able to transfer their response by nicotine through the endothelium to other organs where inflammatory disorders may also develop . The ability of nicotine to affect various T-cell types is well investigated . It can also stimulate immune cells to elevate COX-2 in cells in the gut . NF-kB involved in inflammatory responses is activated by exposure to cigarette smoke or nicotine . One way nicotine has been described to promote tumor growth is by stimulating COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from immune cells. Inflammation may also be augmented by nicotine-induced reduction of cytokine secretion, T cell response and increased activation of platelets . What is the effect of nicotine/smoking on the pancreas? Nicotine in pancreatic cells has been shown to maintain cell viability by increasing GSH levels caused by impaired uptake of the precursor glutamate. The advantage of this is that fewer BTN1A1 exchangers are broken down by ROS and therefore cell viability is increased . In a moderate dose of nicotine Bass et al. observed an elevation of FFA, and a GLU increase . Vice versa, elevated blood levels of FFA are however a known risk factor for p"}

{"text": "Question: What is plantar fasiciitis, and how is it treated? \n ### Answer: Biomechanical ankle and foot injuries are common in sporting events. One such soft tissue injury, plantar fasciitis, is a painful disorder of the foot that affects runners and aerobics enthusiasts in particular. It is caused by the degeneration of a band of connective tissue running along the bottom of the foot, known as the plantar fascia. Without the plantar fascia to support weight-bearing on the foot, pain and inflammation, particularly from the heel bone, are the results. Commonly occurring between the ages of 40 and 60, plantar fasciitis is experienced by 10% of the population. Females are more likely to be affected than men in most instances, and the prevalence of the pain peaks during the first steps of the morning. Over-training and overweight persons are most likely to develop plantar fasciitis."}

{"text": "Question: Define Syncope (ischemic stroke)? \n ### Answer: Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to global cerebral hypoperfusion from a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). The term \u201csyncope\u201d is derived from the Greek word \u201csyn\u201d (together) and \u201ccopein\u201d (to cut short). The loss of consciousness is brief, usually less than a minute, and is followed by a rapid recovery. The term \u201ctransient ischemic attack\u201d (TIA) is used to describe a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal cerebral ischemia. The term \u201csyncope/transient ischemic attack\u201d (STIA) is used to describe a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by global or focal cerebral ischemia."}

{"text": "Question: What doctor specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune diseases? \n ### Answer: While there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, it is best answered by a rheumatologist. A rheumatologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. They have extensive training in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and can help patients understand their disease, as well as how to best manage it. In addition to rheumatologists, there are other healthcare professionals, such as genetic counselors and immunologists, who can also be helpful in treating autoimmune diseases. However, rheumatologists are the most appropriate specialists to help diagnose and treat autoimmune diseases."}
{"text": "Question: To what extent does Effexor cause ED? \n ### Answer: To what extent are SSRI treated depressed patients more prone to ED than depressed patients not treated with this class of drug, and to what extent are people with ED prone to depression? The simultaneity of two diseases neither definitively proving nor excluding a cause effect relations is not unusual and certainly not specific to ED. Attempts to answer the latter question with epidemiological or retrospective studies have raised methodological difficulties, leading some investigators to use sex hormones (variously defined) as a confounding factor in their studies [123, 125]. Sex hormones are poorly defined and measured and cannot easily represent the minimum biologic entity capable of inducing a desired response: the receptors. Given these biases and the fact that ED is a disease of known origin, it would be more appropriate to use animal models of choice behavior rather than human observational studies to examine the putative relationship between SSRI and sexual behavior. Obviously, in this case the difficulty is to identify a truly comparable model species to humans."}
{"text": "Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction? \n ### Answer: There is no direct literature to suggest that NSAIDs may produce erectile dysfunction. Although an indirect conclusion may be drawn from several other articles suggesting a positive correlation between prolonged erections and medication intake, it was hypothesized that indomethacin influence blood flow and produce tachyphylaxis of penile vasodilator vasoactive substances both important to achieving erection in the general population and penis rehabilitation in men who have had a radical prostatectomy [6, 21]. Additionally due to reduced nociceptive input anguish caused by inflammation can be avoided which may indirectly put one in a more comfortable situation to attempt sexual intercourse Finally as previously mentioned Non-aspirin NSAID's inhibit endogenous prostaglandin synthesis. Elevated amounts of prostaglandin I2 in blood have been linked to patients with erectile dysfunction . Dysfunction tends to be more severe in patients with more severe Hyperprostaglandinemia ."}

{"text": "Question: Define temperature exposure and expiration data with regard to pharmacy and warehouse storage for Glimepiride.? \n ### Answer: Temperature exposure is the application of a process, equipment, or system that can generate a direct or indirect thermal impact (heat).?Expiration date is the date where the quality of counterfeit and substandard medical products no longer meet the accepted preserved or control criteria. However, a product, e.g., medicines, may still meet these criteria as specified or designated by pharmacopeial standards.?Temperature deviation occurs as a dimensionless quantity to measure temperature; temperature deviation is the magnitude of a variation from the reference value in the unit of measurement. Thus, in our case, this deviation is indicated in degrees celsius.?Temperature monitoring system is the in-house system that tracks the temperature profile of a place; this will permit the tracking of the temperature variation given to the stored medicinal products.?Temperature monitoring device is the device venue that tracks the temperature profile of particular places."}
