{"text": "Question: What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease? \n ### Answer: Polycyctic kidney disease is a component of Mallory-Weiss syndrome in the Pweb group. Significant renal cysts occur in up to 24 to 30% of individuals with Noonan syndrome and provide a characteristic feature. Individuals with large renal cysts appear to have the most typical features of Noonan syndrome. Noonan syndrome and polycystic disease (PCKD) have some degree of overlap, and a few members of the Pweb class, have been discovered with PCKD. Some sporadic instances of NL syndrome with excessive renal cysts are described in the literature. These people display a polycystic kidney phenotype, on occasion combined with polycystic liver disease, in addition to the other NL features. The majority of these cases were found in families confirming autosomal dominant inheritance. An NL syndrome displaying a polycystic kidney phenotype can serve as an easily understood syndrome aided by autosomal dominant transmission, large multi-cystic round kidneys, renal failure post-juvenile, hearing loss, lentigines, short stature, and pulmonary stenosis. In the clinical simulation, distinctive people described for the polycystic kidney disease exhibited a relative absence of lentigines compared to other NL spectrum disorders. A member of the MIR17HG locus recently identified for autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome, causing deafness, renal system disease, unusual facial appearance, and short stature in individual, also studied for recurring cases of PCKD accompanying NLS.

{"text": "Question: What are the treatments and precautions for VDRL positive (syphilis) patients? \n ### Answer: All persons with acute syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent) should be treated with intramuscular procaine penicillin as follows: 2.4 MU (6 MU for penicillin-sensitive persons). Treatment of patients with ECDC-defined primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis would be 1 dose of benzathine penicillin (2.4 MU given IM) if 24 STC or more are present in any organ sites. Untreated syphilis can be transmitted to others by sexual contact. Avoid being sexually active for 1 incubation period after treatment.

{"text": "Question: Can the administration of anesthesia, during hip replacement surgery, have any negative cognitive effects, especially on patients demonstrating FXTAS? \n ### Answer: This question arises because human genetic diseases are more prevalent, and surgical procedures are increasingly performed that contain high doses of anesthetics, such as arthroplasty. Hence, emphasis has been placed in recent years on finding methods and strategies to help anesthesiologists monitor patients with these diseases to reduce as much as possible any risk of negative events during and after their surgery. In addition, evidence is accumulating that the administration of anesthetics to symptomatic patients with fragile X conditions can negatively affect cognitive performance. For example, Young et al. (1999) found that the full range of anesthesia affect the antioxidative system in the hip putamen of FXTAS patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which anesthesia induces the onset of this disease and the way in which specific anesthetics interact together to influence FXS clinical phenotypes, and especially to clarify the role of the middle cerebral artery anomaly in the expression of FXTAS."}

{"text": "Question: Is uveitis an autoimmune disease? \n ### Answer: The answer is not simple. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the intraocular tissues (the uvea) and is traditionally classified as either anterior or posterior. An immune system\u2013centered approach to the classification of inflammatory disorders termed autoimmune disease is characterized by inflammation of tissues caused by self-antigens.1 These self-antigens can be organs or tissues (i.e., type I diabetes affecting the pancreas). Extrinsic or environmental factors that can act as mono- or polyantigens2 triggering the adaptive system are called triggers (smoking or anti-glaucoma drugs). In patients with uveitis, multiple factors often contribute to the initiation and progression of disease. The specific etiology of a patient's uveitis is highly dependent on age, gender, race, genetic inheritance, and whether or not it is associated with any systemic autoimmune rheumatological disorder."}

{"text": "Question: What are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Are there long-term pulmonary sequelae? Can marrying your cousin cause this? \n ### Answer: ANSWER: There are numerous possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, some as insignificant as a \u201chole\u201d in the membrane that occurred during the early stages of your baby's development. If congenital diaphragmatic hernia is present during fetal life, there will be a reduction in lung volume and a rightward shift of the mediastinum. Potential long-term complications may include decreased lung functioning and pulmonary hypertension (elevated blood pressure in part of the lungs). There are several diseases in which diaphragmatic hernias may occur, including those with reduced formation of the diaphragm, such as Prune Belly Syndrome and Jeune Syndrome, as well as others in which the weakness of the diaphragm results from poor closure after the structures separate. Factual congenital diaphragmatic hernia does not cause the diseases themselves, but there may be a genetic link between them. While the incidence is higher in certain races, for example, children of Spanish or French Canadian descent have a notably higher risk (11.3 per 10,000 births), congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in all ethnicities. HOWEVER, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are both associated with neurofibromatosis, a hereditary condition frequently caused by a lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Therefore, if you have caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, you may want to have your genes tested to see if they have a similar genetic basis. Genetic counseling will be important for individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia during preconception, conception, gestation, birthing, and in the postnatal period."}

But there are many more doctors who do not come from the functional medicine perspective (not basing diagnosis on a search for leaky gut or other functional imbalances). Such doctors would generally advise avoiding high intensity intensity exercise (which is a heart strain, rather than lung strain, as the maximum asthmatic ventilation is on a steady basis) and controlling asthma is difficult and stubborn then the advice would be about mechanisms, principles, etc. They may advise exercises, specific gym equipment/exercises, limiting the type and duration especially for those of severe asthma.

{"text": "Question: Is fildena like viagra and how does it work? \n ### Answer: Fildena is a popular ED medication drug used to treat erectile dysfunction disorder. Fildena is presumed to activate the nitric oxide synthase and increase the release of nitric oxide. Fildena leads to increased levels of cGMP, especially in the penile tissues. This facilitates smooth muscle relaxation in the penile tissues, increased blood flow in the penile region, simultaneous erection, and reduces the painful feeling while having sex, especially for older men."}

{"text": "Question: Can low dose naltrexone be used to treat severe depression? \n ### Answer: Studies have shown a relation between major depression and a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and a few have shown that patients with major depression have less dopamine D2 receptors (122\u2013124). In cell culture, low doses (1 nM) of naltrexone suppressed the degradation of norepinephrine and relieved depression without affecting signaling at the mu opioid receptor (67). This suggests that low doses of naltrexone may even be effective for people with a low density of mu opioid receptors in treatment resistant depression. Further studies are needed to determine whether low dose naltrexone can be used safely and effectively in these cases."}

{"text": "Question: What is hantavirus and is it fatal? \n ### Answer: Hantavirus is a virus that can cause hemorrhagic fever. Whilst these illnesses are generally severe, they can mostly be treated in hospital. On rare occasions, however, the infection can lead to a more serious illness called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and is commonly fatal if left untreated. This syndrome occurs throughout the world and most hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents. In the UK, for example, there is an isolated population of bank voles on Brownsea Island in Southampton. People who visit or live on Brownsea can become infected with a hantavirus called Seoul virus (which causes fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and a rash) from infected voles. Some infected individuals may then develop hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and lymphocytic meningoencephalitis - a serious illness of the lungs and brain."}
{"text": "Question: Is there always an elevated temperature associated with appendicitis? \n ### Answer: We all agree to the fact that rise of body temperature is an ultimate sign of an ongoing inflammation and during acute infectious disease. It\u2019s quite noteworthy that there is a lack of enough clinical data about fever prevalence among patients admitted with suspected appendicitis due to the misdiagnosis of this entity . The level of fever was reported to range between 36\u00b71-38\u00b75\u00b0C and could reach even 41\u00b0C [, , ]. Furthermore, the occurrence of macroscopic purulent peritoneal exudate is not an everyday phenomenon as some researchers present serious concerns about the difficult identification of purulent collection especially in case of detection in the post-operative period. It may be confusing with applying suspicious intra-abdominal hypertension or specific disease and predictive tests of complicated appendicitis such as CT-scan [4,, , , ]. So, in a large proportion of patients with acute appendicitis, the absence of established risk factors for complicated disease may be contributing to the diagnostic \u201cnoise\u201d to prove an urgent indication for laparoscopy or laparotomy. In many instances, using more sensitive indicators to predict severe appendicitis could have prevented many forms of unnecessary tests. MFA is a predictor of acute severe appendicitis, and correct selection of the appropriate imaging modality for surgery or treatment guided by repeat image-guided reassessment specially CT-scan might be preventive. Considering that CT-scan allows necessary invasive intervention compared to the traditional option such as ultrasound scan."}

The condition is usually diagnosed through amniocentesis, or with noninvasive prenatal screening in the first trimester.Karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization are both diagnostic modalities for trisomy 13."}
{"text": "Question: To what extent is quinine in seltzer water effective in treating leg cramps? \n ### Answer: Commercial seltzer water was evaluated for its quinine content. The solution prepared by the manufacturer was consistent in its quinine level (approximately 50 mg/L) over several weeks. Small quantities of the solution were used to treat 1 patient at a time to minimize wastage. The number of bottles needed was relatively low, and seltzer water is inexpensive and easy to find. Furthermore, because it can be self-administered and is easy to carry, seltzer water is more convenient to use as a treatment than other methods (e.g., oral quinine tablets, lotions, or solutions). No severe adverse effects were found for intramuscular injections or quinine lotions. Whereas lotion applications are messy, intramuscular injections are painful, and seltzer water provided a rapid response most similar to that of intramuscular injections than to that of lotions.2,9 Finally, seltzer water can help mitigate the side effects of oral quinine. (It should be noted that when oral quinine and seltzer water are used, they should not mix as they can cause severe vomiting.)Limitations of the technology and disseminationRegulatory concernsRegulations regarding the use of quinine for GI preventative indication vary across the countries, limiting attempts to pass formal legislation for this indication. For example, in the United States, data and protocols were reviewed by the principal regulatory body, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for as many as 15 years with the goal of approving quinine for use as an antiemetic. However, the FDA impeded the approval process. Despite the requirement for a worksheet explaining the foams, no official decision was made. For multijurisdictional approval, the agency explicitly stated that there was no interested party supporting the marketing of the product. Although routine consultation was continued over the years between European Union agencies, they were unable to pass regulations without the support of the FDA. Use of quinine to prevent GI-related and other forms of vomiting remains banned in the United States.Although seltzer water may be more convenient and less costly for use to prevent an attack of cramps given that much less drug is needed than by using quinine infusion, the fastest approach is still the patient\u2019s"}

{"text": "Question: What is maximum daily dosage of Metformin? \n ### Answer: MNT formularies, with different tolerability and side effect profiles, form the basis of guidelines for choosing an optimal hypoglycaemic drug. Current ADA, ADA/EASD and other guidelines suggest starting a patient with MNT once it has failed. The question thus is what is the maximum dose of metformin A patient can take with adequate safety profile? We find roughly six guidelines, and there is real diversity of opinion. Should they be all condemned as incompetent practices or there are some scientific grounds present for each of the guidelines? Various guidelines suggest metformin's daily dose (if increased from initial dose) should be based on number of glucose-lowering drugs prescribed, age of the patient, kidney function and diabetes duration (bracketing increased risk of lactic acidosis). These guidelines are also based on various studies that have at some point or other tried to establish the maximum metformin dose on the basis of LAB (doto)."}

This is responsible for the majority of clinical symptoms of KTS.Cardinal findings in KTS include hyperplasia of skin and soft tissue, musculoskeletal deformity, lymphatic malformations, and ocular complications.Genetic linkage has not been definitively established for KTS. Results of many previous studies seemed to show that the majority of KTS patients were genetically predisposed to the condition. Familial occurrence ranges from 3% to 22%. Recessive and dominant inheritance have been suggested but neither theory adequately explains the wide variety of affected body parts.Surgical therapies may include angiographic embolization and wide surgical excision.Suggested treatment includes physical therapy, exercise, and attention to posture to help prevent contractures.Individual treatment must be limited according to unique characteristics of KTS patients.Recommendation for treatment should be individually tailored to the child and their specific presentation.Patient-centered communication and parent involvement with treatment plan are imperative for optimal development and wellbeing."}

{"text": "Question: What is your position on Homozygout MTHFR A1298C (a genetic change) Issues and long term prognosis? \n ### Answer: Regarding the long-term prognosis, we should consider several factors as a whole. These include, but not limited to, the genetic background; environmental factors such as smoking, coffee, and alcohol; low folate intake; and manners related to the disease and its treatment. MTHFR is a gene that can influence the process of folate metabolism. Homozygous mutations in this gene is known to cause a significant decrease in the level of activity of the gene. Some studies have shown that homozygous MTHFR A1298C has increased cancer rate. However, the majority of research shows that it has no certain impact on long-term prognosis, and unlike some other genetic changes, it cannot impact life expectancy. Homozygous MTHFR A1298C has some effect on increasing the risk of some diseases in some patients. It has increased risk of cancers such as folic acid deficiency and cervical cancer , and in other studies, its association with pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , and colorectal cancer  have been reported. Aside from cancerous diseases, homozygous MTHFR A1298C has also been linked to C677T polymorphism  and other diseases such as MTHFR A1298CC/C677TT which is a determinant of ischemic stroke . As can be seen, the effects of MTHFR A1298C mutation are not limited to a single aspect, and this extends to recurrent pregnancy loss. 5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) A1298C mutation has some effect on the recurrent pregnancy loss, but the extent to which this mutation affects it, and what other factors play a role in this condition are factors that need to be considered in these cases . 5, 10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation has shown an increased risk of pregnancy loss. Based on several studies, a mixed mutation of the homozygous MTHFR A1298C and C677T mutation has had no relation to pregnancy termination.  Nevertheless, there are studies that have shown an increased association between"}

{"text": "Question: What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body? \n ### Answer: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body\u2019s immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This results in a lack of insulin, which is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes typically develops in children or young adults, but it can also occur in older adults. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and age. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and can develop at any age, but it is more common in older adults. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It typically resolves after pregnancy, but women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life."}

{"text": "Question: Is it recommended for patients on Lipitor to have their liver function monitored by blood testing every six months.? \n ### Answer: In fact, TG is the coenzyme (not cofactor) that carries electrons from NADH to Oxidized LDL cholesterol/ferricyanide to reduce ferricin+ electrons to ferrocyanide (hypoxanthine). TG is required at approximately a 3:1 ratio to cholesterol. The lower the TGs then the lower the Oxidized LDL C cholesterol potential to damage the vascular endothelium is, although what is termed oxidized LDL C is considerably less likely to cause vascular damage than coagulated Lipoproteins with Phospholipids (VLDL and LDL) as well as Activated MacroPhages due to the largely elevated levels of PAI-1. PAI-1 over being produced in the liver by activated hepatic stellate cells, is an important wound clotting factor that plasmalogens can prevent coagulation of Lipoproteins, and thus vascular occlusion-causing thrombotic occlusions are almost entirely preventable from those factors that are phospholipid-dependent."}
{"text": "Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit? \n ### Answer: It is known that calcium supplements can cause the urine to become very alkaline and that calcium crossing the kidney epithelial cell with this degree of alkalinity results in extracellular calcium (hard) deposits in the kidney. We have suggested that the addition of magnesium to supplements was useful to prevent calcium deposits in the sub-endothelial space. To date, it is unknown if calcium supplementation with magnesium is more effective than calcium alone, and definitive studies addressing this question will likely take years to complete. Therefore, we would suggest that individuals with osteoporosis or who are at higher risk for osteoporosis receive concurrent magnesium along with their calcium supplements, until the optimal use of magnesium in supplements can be judged in large clinical trials."}

{"text": "Question: Can chronic cervicitis cause infertility? Why would tampons cause inflammation? \n ### Answer: Was scarring from previous procedures causative? Timing and presence of sexually transmitted infections continue to confound reports, despite medical intervention (Delaney and Sullivan, 1999). As much as half of T. vaginalis burden is asymptomatic (Passman, 1983; Rosenbaum et al., 2002). Biopsies, Pap smears, and culture rely on active infection of vaginal and cervical mucosa and poor sampling of large bodies of vaginal secretions. Does infection delay a woman\u2019s reproductive life? Co-infections with pathogens complicate studies of the role of T. vaginalis in sperm dysfunction. The solitary progenitor of T. vaginalis originated from a parasitically breeding algae before evolving (Anderson et al., 1995). Do environmental conditions influence pathogenicity? These questions, motivating bench research for decades lack answers. Researchers must understand Trichomonas cellular mechanisms, development under in vitro culture environments mimicking human hosts, and how an early transition from aqueous to nutrient compromised conditions may have compromised Trichomonas fitness under such conditions. Greater understanding may lead to novel prevention methods or genetic modifications to reduce pathogenicity."}

The results will help provide better evidence on whether metformin leads to an increase in blood pressure. Nevertheless, it seems that long-term metformin treatment less than first-line treatment with sulfonylureas does not significantly increase the incidence of hypertension. Additionally, metformin use has been recently associated with an improvement in BP among people with obesity without diabetes, a finding which if confirmed could provide a rationale for an anti-hypertensive effect for metformin."}

{"text": "Question: What are the effects of smoking and/or nicotine on the digestive system? \n ### Answer: Cigarette smoke has a detrimental effect on stomach function and can affect dryness of the mouth. It in addition has an effect on the digestion of carbohydrates and lipids, thereby rendering hepatocytes more susceptible to inflammation . Nicotine may reduce gastrointestinal motility, which may increase the risk for constipation . Smoking may also alter the activity of orexins, possibly contributing to obesity . What is the effect of smoking/nicotine on the colon/rectum? Cigarette smoke condensate has been found to have a carcinogenic and a colonotoxic effect on the rectal mucosa . These findings are not in favor of smoking on colon cancer or colorectal polyps although data is actually lacking . Yet there is also remarkably little research on the direct effect of nicotine on colon cancer . How does smoking/nicotine affect immune cells in the digestive tract? It is conceivable that immune cells in the gut are able to transfer their response by nicotine through the endothelium to other organs where inflammatory disorders may also develop . The ability of nicotine to affect various T-cell types is well investigated . It can also stimulate immune cells to elevate COX-2 in cells in the gut . NF-kB involved in inflammatory responses is activated by exposure to cigarette smoke or nicotine . One way nicotine has been described to promote tumor growth is by stimulating COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from immune cells. Inflammation may also be augmented by nicotine-induced reduction of cytokine secretion, T cell response and increased activation of platelets . What is the effect of nicotine/smoking on the pancreas? Nicotine in pancreatic cells has been shown to maintain cell viability by increasing GSH levels caused by impaired uptake of the precursor glutamate. The advantage of this is that fewer BTN1A1 exchangers are broken down by ROS and therefore cell viability is increased . In a moderate dose of nicotine Bass et al. observed an elevation of FFA, and a GLU increase . Vice versa, elevated blood levels of FFA are however a known risk factor for p"}

{"text": "Question: What is plantar fasiciitis, and how is it treated? \n ### Answer: Biomechanical ankle and foot injuries are common in sporting events. One such soft tissue injury, plantar fasciitis, is a painful disorder of the foot that affects runners and aerobics enthusiasts in particular. It is caused by the degeneration of a band of connective tissue running along the bottom of the foot, known as the plantar fascia.

A rheumatologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. They have extensive training in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and can help patients understand their disease, as well as how to best manage it. In addition to rheumatologists, there are other healthcare professionals, such as genetic counselors and immunologists, who can also be helpful in treating autoimmune diseases.

{"text": "Question: To what extent does Effexor cause ED? \n ### Answer: To what extent are SSRI treated depressed patients more prone to ED than depressed patients not treated with this class of drug, and to what extent are people with ED prone to depression? The simultaneity of two diseases neither definitively proving nor excluding a cause effect relations is not unusual and certainly not specific to ED. Attempts to answer the latter question with epidemiological or retrospective studies have raised methodological difficulties, leading some investigators to use sex hormones (variously defined) as a confounding factor in their studies [123, 125]. Sex hormones are poorly defined and measured and cannot easily represent the minimum biologic entity capable of inducing a desired response: the receptors. Given these biases and the fact that ED is a disease of known origin, it would be more appropriate to use animal models of choice behavior rather than human observational studies to examine the putative relationship between SSRI and sexual behavior. Obviously, in this case the difficulty is to identify a truly comparable model species to humans."}
{"text": "Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction? \n ### Answer: There is no direct literature to suggest that NSAIDs may produce erectile dysfunction. Although an indirect conclusion may be drawn from several other articles suggesting a positive correlation between prolonged erections and medication intake, it was hypothesized that indomethacin influence blood flow and produce tachyphylaxis of penile vasodilator vasoactive substances both important to achieving erection in the general population and penis rehabilitation in men who have had a radical prostatectomy [6, 21]. Additionally due to reduced nociceptive input anguish caused by inflammation can be avoided which may indirectly put one in a more comfortable situation to attempt sexual intercourse Finally as previously mentioned Non-aspirin NSAID's inhibit endogenous prostaglandin synthesis. Elevated amounts of prostaglandin I2 in blood have been linked to patients with erectile dysfunction . Dysfunction tends to be more severe in patients with more severe Hyperprostaglandinemia ."}

Some recommended permissible limits of magnesium are as follows : Magnesium intake from the diet, supplements, nutrients, and medicines should be between 320 and 420 mg per day for adults.The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of magnesium is 320 mg per day for adults.There are no fixed upper limits for magnesium intake from supplements unless magnesium salt is taken as therapy, where PO200 mg magnesium hydroxide per day is relatively safe also in prenatal care period .Long-term magnesium therapy for the treatment of heart disease is mainly limited by the gastrointestinal side effects of magnesium salts like diarrhea and nausea. On the other hand, side effects of oral intake of magnesium are generally modest compared to the disadvantages of parenteral administration routes. Supplements should only be taken between meals as they are likely to give gastrointestinal side effects ."}

{"text": "Question: taken off this medicine / how might it affect me? palmarosa? \n ### Answer: Research into palmarosa is in the starting blocks. Most studies want to find out more about the plant\u2019s properties, but by examining the published studies more in detail we will be able to discover parallels and differences with valerian extracts. A study with rats supports valerian\u2019s sedative effect . The test subjects took a drug in a 1:1 ratio with either desmodium or standard drug or with placebo. Both these combinations turned out to cause hyperactivity in the animals. The administration of a combination of sulfate of copper with Serc 500 mg reduces the requirement for standard drugs by 80 to 100%. Desmodium is a natural stabiliser which can be used to stop the sedative effect of serc. In several animal studies, the blood and brain levels of serotonin rose, which lead to an increase in systolic blood pressure. In the other studies, the influence on serotonin was not discovered. Excretion of domperidone in the urine increased in rats , as did the dry weight and secretion of bile in the liver . When valerian extract was administered during transient encephalopathy, the encephalopathy in the tested individuals from two control and three experimental groups shortened. One of the three test subjects experienced jitters, weakness, and contractions of the diaphragm once. After extinction of the seizure, no contraindications were stated for valerian. Periodically, valerian sulfate causes contractions of respiratory muscles sometimes. Heart hemodynamics did not change throughout the experiment (44). The clinical picture of valerian-induced urticaria includes intense-itching with or without rash . The nomen clastis \u2018Rasisserum\u2019 designates the advertising slogan of the original pharmaceutical product Rasisserum, as did the composition of the product, for which among others valerian was used. The content was especially beneficial to \u2018nervous dyspeptics\u2019; specifically it was aimed at the Hungarian elite. Between 1888 and 1895, about fifty German, French, Italian, and English patents referred to treatments of nervous diseases with valerian.

Therefore, to cure diabetes we should overcome the chemical imbalances in the body. Scientists have identified the 6-transmembrane protein insulin receptor and its ligand insulin. The target of insulin can either be pancreatic \u03b2-cells or peripheral cells. Insulin targets pancreatic \u03b2-cells to increase the release of insulin. Insulin targets peripheral cells to increase glucose uptake and decrease glucose production."}

{"text": "Question: dtap/tdap/td vaccines how often is this due? \n ### Answer: Down the transmission chain we could define three categories, inquired one participant: your daughter will be protected more in category N1 against 90 per cent of the children she will be infected by, [while] for category N2 she will be protected 80 per cent of the time and category N3 [will achieve] let\u2019s say, 70 per cent of the time against transmission competent d vaccines. You need to figure out which category of children \u2013 transmitters \u2013 you want to protect and who you need to vaccinate for that to occur. If I were to work out \u2026 world class immunology, I would be able to calculate this and advise you. But I am not, I am epidemiological modeler. What will follow [from the dose/response relationships] is that the nominal efficacy, here the efficacy in infants, [can be reallocated] proportionally upstream on the chain of transmission.Now, this is important. This is important. If you achieve good immunogenicity in infants, then you need high efficacy of relevant transmission chains N1 => infant >> child [&] child => child comprehended by participant [this participant] assessing the simulation results. But if I will spend less time immunizing groups two and three and more time immunizing kids who will be less protected because of this \u2026 how do I then convince the receiver, who assumes we would get vaccines producing only 70 per cent efficacy if at all, that vaccinating infants is going to benefit them now? I also have vaccine that will protect [recipient] with quite a high efficacy against transmission.

{"text": "Question: is lyrica the same as gabbentine? \n ### Answer: XXGW: agree and disagree. Yes and no. Yes because it is used to treat the same conditions and tends to yield the same efficacy. No because its chemical structure is different and it requires a different pharmacodynamic mechanism to elicit its therapeutic action. In contrast to gammabenzine, lyrica does not exert anti-seizure effects because it neither enhances GABAA transmission nor reduces glutamatergic transmission. Nrxinodol, a non-imidazotetrazine NMDA-receptor antagonist that increases GABA and reduces glutamate thus decreasing neuronal excitation, might contrast lyrica . It seems that a complete picture can shape an accurate opinion that mutually reinforces facts . This consolidates the view of distant psychopharmacological dogma; psychotropics harbor distinct and between them void pharmacological profiles. The \u201cneurochemical\u201d differences among psychotropics may be the basis to improve further the knowledge in neuroscience and psychopharmacology, to crystalize consensus and data-driven care and to design unbiased care based on an appealing \u201cmedicinal chemistry\u201d . A future extended collaboration with all the prominent psychopharmacologists worldwide can lead to a seminal paper, to answer the following question; is evolution moving in a recently recognized direction as in case of antibiotic resistance or cancer therapy? Is the evolution of psychopharmacology moving in a recently recognized direction? The new frontiers in science rely on knowledge and factual dissemination to avoid unexpected side effects and ultimately to tailor drug treatment to the individual etiology ."}

{"text": "Question: seniors and premarin?\n? \n ### Answer: lutely. Tranylcypromine is good for the end of an acute attack, but nowhere near as good as the tolcapone combination. The tolcapone augments the re-uptake of dopamine to give a better hastening of resolution of the acute attack over the next 48 hours. The blocking of serotonin (moclobemide) and noradrenaline (mappingemide) is to offset the lowered levels of these neurotransmitters seen in seniors after pargyline is given. Premarin is not nearly as good as tranylcypromine. Did they really mean to ask about premarin or was it the attempt to ask about tranylcypromine? Could these cases be separated into categories of what drug was asked about? This would increase the precision of the paper and it would be very helpful if they could sort out the questionnaire responses into this. Response: Both senior and premarin are a result of the template code book sent to all the participating sites for conducting an Interviewer Administered Questionnaire. The site mentioned regarding premarin was a utility field and the Questionnaire was administered at the baseline visit; hence the question raised does not result passionate effect 45 more Could these cases be separated into categories of what drug was asked about?

{"text": "Question: how opioids reduce pain\n? \n ### Answer: As a molecule, but not a receptor, opioids reduce pain by interacting with \u00b5 opioid receptors in the peripheral and central nervous systems. \u00b5-opioid receptors are principally found in the spinal cord, but they may also be found in brain areas such the thalamus and cortex. \nDopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, together with other neurotransmitters, reduce pain by stimulating their neurons. However, by attaching \u00b5 opioid receptors, opioids prevent neurons from sending pain signals to the brain."}

Tracheal intubation and ventilator mechanical ventilation can induce dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, acute hypotension, and can lead to hemodynamic crises. Using vasoactive and inotropic drugs to improve cardiac function is recommended. Dopamine is a catecholamine with a strong extent of peripheral and central activity  and can be used as a first-line vasoactive and inotropic drug in prehospital emergency patients with shock. If the response is unsatisfactory, norepinephrine can be used as a vasospective drug to maintain perfusion pressure to meet different systems\u2019 needs for circulatory shock or severe haemorrhage [25\u201329].

{"text": "Question: what are beta blockers\n? \n ### Answer: beta blockers are drugs that selectively block beta-adrenergic receptors. these receptors are found mainly in the heart, where they mediate the stimulating (positive) effects of the sympathetic nervous system (part of the autonomic nervous system) on the cardiovascular system. beta blockers inhibit the \"fight-or-flight\" response during stress by blocking the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine (stress hormones) by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. they reduce heart rate, cardiac work and myocardial contractility, and improve cardiac oxygen consumption. beta blockers are therefore used to treat heart disease and some other heart disorders. beta blockers are also used in sports medicine to regulate training levels and enhance athletic performance. the three different generations of beta blockers are listed below with examples of each type: (1) first-generation, i.e., \"nonselective\" beta blockers, such as propranolol,\u663e\u6094\u4e09\u805a\u5206\u6563\u3002 they affect all three beta receptors: (2) second-generation \"selective\" beta blockers, such as atenolol, which affect beta(1) and beta(2) receptors but not beta(1) receptors. they produce less hypotension than first-generation beta blockers.(3) third-generation beta blockers, which display varying selectivity for any or all beta receptors. they share less adrenergic blocking activity than their beta(1) and beta(2) counterparts, including nebivolol, which selectively blocks beta(1) receptors and can even produce vasodilation in the pulmonary arteries. another group of third-generation beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, is in use or undergoing clinical trials for cardioprotection."}

The half-life of carbidopa varies greatly by patient due to genetic polymorphisms, drug-drug interactions, and other factors. Once carbidopa is absorbed into the bloodstream, it is broken down in the liver and excreted largely in the urine. Carbidopa levodopa can be detected in the urine for up to 24-72 hours after ingestion. Because there are a lot of variables that go into the rate of elimination of carbidopa levodopa, we would need information specific to the person in question (such as body mass index, other medications they are taking, dose of medication, etc.) to fully address this question. In general, substantial plasma levels of carbidopa remain after 8 hours."}

{"text": "Question: how can biotin effect my blood test\n? \n ### Answer: : How can biotin affect my blood tests?: Vitamin B12 test: As biotin is a B-complex vitamin, it is a common contaminant for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Biotin also binds to T(-)} and is presumptively inactive, it can cause interference in blood tests used to measure vitamin B12 levels. Such interference can lead to a false diagnosis of a vitamin B12 deficiency and therefore possibly lead to the belief that vitamin B12 supplements are required when actually they are not: CBC and differential: Can be falsely elevated . As biotin binds to thiol groups, it will also bind to peptide antibodies in serum. This can lead to increased levels of IgG and total protein in serum levels on blood tests. As such, CBC and differential tests that are discussed in the differential for leukemias as common causes of increased white blood cells are now slightly less common since the use of biotin. HCT levels though can be falsely low because of biotin interference also since T(3{-)} are thiol groups: Hypoglycemic blood tests: APPT and PT are assays that measure the ability of a plasma sample to coagulate and form blood clots. Since biotin is also an anti-Xa factor (insights the effect on clotting factor), it decreases the ability to form a clot in the plasma sample. This leads to a false decreased level of APPT and PT making patients appear to not have hypoglycemic glucose level complications when in fact they do: Alanine transaminase (ALT) & Aspartate transaminase (AST): Biotin can cause an increase in ALT and ALT, these can lead to an increase in liver enzymes causing the liver to look inflamed and cancers or overgrowth of tissue and therefore a concern in weaning and using biotin."}

{"text": "Question: what do steroids do to the brain? \n ### Answer: Many studies have found that both animal models and clinical studies of steroid therapy have a significant risk of mood disorders or sleep disorders. Many animal studies have confirmed that it is likely that these sleep disorders are due to sustained intracellular calcium (ICa2+) release and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) of neurons, leading to synapse loss, loss of synaptic integration, and ultimately resulting in behavioral abnormalities, consistent with anxiety and depression (188\u2013192). ER stress-induced by steroid hormones leads to the transport of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), an ER molecular chaperone, to the cell surface. There is a direct correlation between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and GRP78 in the blood of patients . Human astrocytes are also subject to ER stress, which can induce reactive oxygen species and death (194). This can explain the abnormalities of age-related/inflammatory degeneration and regeneration neurons. Astrocytic flattening occurred in neurons induced by GRP78 and Sp1 signaling activation (195). In the mouse brain, adrenal steroids such as corticosterone also upregulated the expression of hippocampal GRP78, which maintained cell calpain activity during corticosterone administration and caused significant expression of the immediate early genes c-Fos and jun (196)."}

However, its preventive effect on low-grade prostate cancer has been recognized.Pathology of high grade or low grade prostate cancer is different. High grade means cancer can already become a grade that is easy to find by digital rectal examination, and then regular cancer the follow-up and treatment will be changed, so high-grade is malignant at the beginning.As for low-grade cancer, most doctors will advise \u201cActive Surveillance\u201d and closely monitor it till it becomes \u201chigh-grade cancer\u201d, and then performing surgery.Long-term monitoring requires financial and labor resources.

{"text": "Question: tranexamic acid how fast does it work? \n ### Answer: 2022-09-28T08:39ISBTXA is a fast-acting antimicrobial agent that prevents bacterial cell division by irreversibly binding to the active site of glutamic acid, cysteine, and prevention of inhibitor formation. The primary physiological action of TXA is complete plasma epsilon inhibition, and inhibition of fibrinolysis stops bleeding through a plasmatic fluid to prevent action. The effect begins within 1 to 2 minutes of intravenous administration and has a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. Although the free concentration of TXA decreases at AT 48 hours, the effect on fibrinolysis may last at least 8\u201312 hours after administration. Antithrombotic effects decay gradually over 12\u201324 hours, and fibrinolytic activity is decreased for 48\u201372 hours in the tissue. In the basic blood obtained by healthy individuals, the administration of TXA in different doses falls in the range of half-life 1 hour to 2 hours, in patients with renal clinics. More dose may be required to achieve the drug plasma concentration in the therapeutic range due to decreased drug elimination.3-5"}

{"text": "Question: what ppis this medication for simvastatin? \n ### Answer: \u2019 According to the input syntax, simvastatin is a medication for preventing atherosclerosis, and so this question about simvastatin is relevant to the clinical topic of atherosclerosis, not triggered of statins. However, the result contains entries related to both topics of simvastatin and atherosclerosis separately (e.g., \u2018Simvastatin is used in the treatment of atherosclerosis and in the prevention of cardiovascular events [\u2026] and similar to other statins\u2019 (p. 5 )). At the same time, many dismissed questions were not relevant to the query, also reflecting the complex real-life scenarios described by Gaster et al. (2016)  and Cook et al. (2019) . They noted that most of them either contained incorrect information (e.g., \u2018hi my aunt is 80 and is currently been prescribed simvastatin for 3 months already. she had her hdl and ldl tested and everything is normal. the doctor wants to increase the dose to 80 which seems high\u2026what does he mean by this?\u2019) or set a specific context that was not within the scope of the query (e.g., \u2018my dad is 70, diabetic, after a heart attack + angioplasty + 2 stents. VICTA WAS PRESCRIBED but once again we are told it wasn\u2019t required. Has anyone else found this to be true?\u2019). All of these observations biased both the result and evaluation. First, evaluation indicators such as Precision and Recall are mostly overestimated since the number of relevant questions is therefore finite. Second, since the previous step slices the whole reasoning process, the evaluation stops when a partial explanation is generated and thus leads to termination of the system before the right answer is found. Consequently, the system performance is underestimated. Last but not the least, none of these existing studies provide clear definitions about the relation aspect; they all explained their hypotheses from the QA aspect, but the evaluation results showed that they were indeed from the relation aspect. The difference between QA and relation is that the former tries more to discover an \u2018answer\u2019 to a constructed layer, while the latter tries to figure out the relationship between two meaningful concepts like \u2018treatment\u2019 and \u2018simvastatin\u2019."}

{"text": "Question: will citalopram exacerbate heart arrhythmias? \n ### Answer: Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been on the market for about 30 years, is the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the United States. This class of antidepressants was originally supposed to be safer than the tricyclics, which were thought to require careful monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with risk factors such as advanced age with comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), personal or family history of long QT syndrome or prior cardiac disease. Based on adverse drug event reporting systems, concerns have been raised that citalopram and other SSRIs might carry an increased risk for onset of torsade de pointes, sometimes related to QT prolongation on ECG . However, the data regarding actual risk of arrhythmias are conflicting, and many citalopram safety studies suggest no increased risk . To address the issue of increased arrhythmia risk with SSRIs, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently published a \u201cDrug Safety and Availability\u201d article, followed by an updated \u201cDrug Labeling and Safety Information\u201d warning for all antidepressants, stating that: \"antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of clinically significant adverse events (AEs) of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, dystonia, tremor, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia, akinesia, and impaired coordination in a dose-dependent manner, and of abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs), mainly QT prolongation; \u2026 Antidepressants should not be used in patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmia, recent aggravation of ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy or unstable angina \u2026\" . The FDA\u2019s clear implication is that any medication for depression which is related to adverse arrhythmia events should be handled with high degrees of caution and concern. However, physicians involved in treating patients with cancer, undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation, and in particular patients with cancer who are depressed, must also know that the very chemotherapy used to treat malignancies may directly induce cital"}

Moreover, while there is some chemical explanation for how the bupropion hydrochloride makes it way from the monolithic patch into the veins, the authors do not adequately explain the process. Specifically, when a patch is placed on the skin, what is the \"drug-release rate\" and what is it actually releasing into? Again, the materials from the FDA website state that the rate will adjust based on the metabolism rate of each person using the patch. While this is technologically sound and meant to improve bioavailability of the drug, it also is a little scary. It seems the authors could have done a better job of acknowledging that there is a kind of black box nature to the mechanism that makes it work."}

{"text": "Question: what class is diazepam\n? \n ### Answer: , defined as the minimum value of u(v) such that . We have obtained this threshold based on the problem that the values unusually lower than it are not frequent: e.g. all values under the intersection of the red and green lines are not frequent. The thresholds E1 and E2 identify two different regimes. The first treats all cases where there is a high level of dissatisfaction (low satisfaction) associated with one of the two alternatives; the second treats the remaining cases, including the large majority of interactions with medium satisfaction associated with both alternatives. E1 is very small, as well as the specific contributions, which are below the general average. On the other hand, values of E2 and u(v) have a narrow range between and. As clarified in Multimedia Appendix 5, the contribution is directly proportional to the level of satisfaction of the interviewer and also to the level of satisfaction of the user. But the contribution also depends on the frequency of interactions fulfilling a certain criterion, which explains the abrupt variation of E1. The flexibility provided by the DAAG approach may be considered in the interpretation of the results."}

The authors comment that the concentration of cocaine in the gut (>200 micromolar) is more than two orders magnitude greater than in the brains of rats (150 nM). However this comparison is incorrect since the amount of cocaine in the gut has to be lower than that needed to to diffuse into the nervous system to be active. Also, behavioural and neurophysiological effects of cocaine have been characterised in snails (both Helix and Lymnaea) that show that cocaine acts in a similar way to the embrace in Drosophila, affecting less that 10% of neurons to elicit behavioural changes (Sawada et al, 2015)"}

It reduces acute stroke risk by more than 70% and the risk of death by about 20%. But it is not without its shortcomings. That includes a delayed onset of benefit and blood pressure changes  (more possibility of hyperkalemia, fluid retention and its neurotoxic effects). Additionally, the rate for stroke prevention is different across patients with AF. It should be emphasized that it is indicated in all patients who have suffered a stroke and all aged patients with Atrial Flutter (AF) particularly in those who have pressure overload particularly because of hypertension. 11.

Please clarify that state with an edit as I can't make sense of it. Yes, it is possible to take amoxicillin and hydrocodone at a time. It would be a combination.

One way which can be used to combine basic and clinical studies is to create multiple second generation models at different stages. The study which used 16 embryonic stem cell models of neurological disorders demonstrated that the ASCL1 gene was up regulated in the presence of LHX6 knockdown, which exists in many hereditary disorders such as Blc-mutation disorder in transfected embryonic stem cells. Laminin was seen to increase cell adhesion and the production of the ASCL1 protein responsible for deriving neuronal cells17. Notch was found to repress m5HT in 2006, which was also found to be active in the treatment of hearing loss with midribriorthiazide18. Due to these findings, it can be further anticipated that the same transcription factors or similar for neural growth and notch signalling can be used by certain drugs to alter or reverse the effects which induce certain neurological disorders. Building personal devices which detect specific cortisol receptors such as MR and transniotic has an essential part to play in drug trials of psychiatric illnesses. This will enable adjustments midline to individualize treatment and care, increase the overall success and beat some of the stigma around not struggling with mental illness.33.

This insight is transformative: the eliminative nature of inversion is the giving of institutional form to the reality of withdrawal (or otherwise put the vital nonoperativity of institutions). Accordingly, it is inversion that should be taken as the paradigmatic relationship to the dynamic structure of institutionally \u201cfree\u201d or autonomous activity that conscious subjects and their culturecould embody. Information inversion, then, differs from information transduction because there is no longer any logic of transduction\u2014in particular, the absence of a donor operates to stipulate that the sweep of information is of the order of withdrawal."}
{"text": "Question: where does fluorouracil come from? \n ### Answer: fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5--FU) is an antimetabolite substance that was first discovered in 1957 by Mariami and De Santo . Its chemical structure and molecular formula are C3H6FN2O2 and the structure and formula are shown below. It is mainly used in the treatment of cancer, especially for skin cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. However, 5-fluorouracil, as a topical medication, is effective in treating Actinic Keratosis (AK), Dysplastic Narrow Band, a precancerous condition of colon cancer, xanthine soft tissue cancer and Kallman\u2019s syndrome. It was the first anticancer drug to be used in cancer chemotherapy, and 5-fluorouracil was approved by the FDA in 1967 . Its isotope tracer, 18F-fluorodeoxyuridine, can be used to diagnose malignant lymphoma and can be labelled with iodine-131 for the treatment of thyroid cancer. The development of the antimetabolite group is mainly to suppress DNA polymerase and DNA synthesis, and the mechanism is to inhibit the production of amino acids, RNA and DNA by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, and to use the oxins-amine overlapping reductase of tumor cells with a thymidine kinase is combined with 5-fluorouracil to form (5--FU)-monophosphate. Thymidine phosphorylase then hydrolyzes 5-fluorouracil-monophosphate to produce 5-fluorouracil, which is metabolized by dihydrofolate reductase to form two metabolites, 5--fluorouridine and 5--fluorodihydropyrimidine (5--FUTP)."}
{"text": "Question: chlorpheniramine how long in system? \n ### Answer: drew the schematic metabolism of chlorpheniramine, the plane is blocked. It can be observed that the metabolic route is very simple, many of them go to the liver and excreted in urine. In addition to liver metabolism, some of which combine with protein to form chlorpheniramine, although the metabolic rate is less than the liver's. Medication at least 10 minutes will affect the degree of metabolism. After oral administration of a therapeutic dose of chlorpheniramine, about 90% can be absorbed and reach peak plasma concentrations of exogenous drugs within 1~1.5 hours, including regulating the production of dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine. Binding to \u03b1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors can block the effects on enzyme secretion, blood pressure, and respiration, and \u03b22 receptors can enhance muscle relaxation.

{"text": "Question: ,Are scars permanently? \n ### Answer: and -Bulk Risk (sarcoidosis) data could be useful to validate the predictive capacity of the model. It is difficult to imagine an observer that should be able to reproducibly distinguish scars on the VSR HR\u2010IRM images. Concerning these seven cases, the algorithm would be fooled by the size and location of the VSR HR\u2010IRM enhanced nodule. Consequently, extending the extracted ROIs to cover the entire ventricle would lead to a rock solid prediction. However, using ROIs covering the entire ventricle would also lead to a high false\u2010positive prediction rate. In these situations one should take the clinical knowledge and experience into account and face the situation accordingly. Usage of still images for validation purposes will not help in this situation; nevertheless, it has to be promoted as described by Phillips et al. 26"}

{"text": "Question: ,At what age does penile cancer occur? \n ### Answer: - The mean age of the cases of squamous cell penile cancer was 67 years, with a range of 38 to 95 years. The maximum frequency is located between 60 and 80 years old .- The incidence is greater in cases of early circumcision and is higher among the Ashkenazi population. It is also more common in those with phimosis and in those with poor socioeconomic levels. It is a condition related to an increased risk of HPV infection (neural type) , .- Risk factors are tobacco use and occupational exposure to heavy metals and ionizing radiation .- The cancer naturally evolves in the form of laser condylomas and migratory changes of the abnormal skin. Even though it can manifest in the lower part of the penis, it is more common in the upper part, up to the corona. In advanced stages, histological changes can progress to the scrotum.The clinical evolution of penile cancer is similar to other neoplastic processes in that it begins as a pebble, grows to form a nodule, and then develops into a plaque, plateau, and ulcer. Currently, there is no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma originating in this pathology. This suggests that there is a histologic presentation in the anomalous epithelial skin without progression to natural malignancy .Therefore, the SBO recommends the systematic execution of EPX in all patients to identify such dysplasia; however, all patients who have clinically manifested lesions should be referred to a specialist in genitourinary cancer in order to define the most appropriate therapeutic conduct but not to delay the treatment in symptomatic patients .- Low-grade dysplasia was found in 73.1% of patients with penile condyloma. Among these patients, 15.3% presented with high-grade dysplasia  \u0399\u0399).The evolution of a nonhealing ulcer, the presence of exophytic materials, or persistent pain must be studied with biopsies to rule out an epithelial nonmalignant or malign tumor.

{"text": "Question: ,At what age should cataracts be removed? \n ### Answer: The choice between surgery and observation for cataracts depends on visual acuity, visual functional considerations, ocular health, and life expectancy. Survivor age should be considered, as younger patients will better tolerate the surgical procedure and optical treatment. If a good visual outcome is expected and the preoperative visual status of the eye is closely matched with postoperative vision, lens-sparing cataract surgery is possible for many patients. If good visual function is important (for example, for work, aviation, art), visual acuity is poor, and life expectancy is good, cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation may be performed, even for survivors below 30% of their life expectancy. In addition, we need to evaluate cataract surgery risks, which are mainly determined by patient age, condition of the lens capsule, and the \u03c6 of the lens. A thorough examination of the lens condition can be done with slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ultrasound ocular biometry, and optical coherence tomography."}

{"text": "Question: ,Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? \n ### Answer: Ectopic pregnancies rarely survive and have a high mortality rate . In addition, surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy requires a dilation and curettage (D&C) to minimize vasovagal responses. While the principal focus of the paper is to diagnose and treat the patient, the physician should be prepared for performing a D&C should it be needed. D&C is typically reserved for the second trimester. It is indicated for the removal of products of conception in the first trimester if a viable pregnancy is not desired or the fetus is not viable (<24 wks) or a miscarriage is imminent. The New York State Task Force on Life and the Law recommends dilation and curettage up until the end of the first trimester followed by aspiration up until the end of the second trimester.

This includes high fever that doesn't go down, pus coming out of the urine, and life-threatening shock syndrome. Treatment with oral or IV (intravenous) antibiotics should be started as soon as possible to resolve this condition. A timely definitive diagnosis allows definitive treatment for the patient. The physician knows which type of antibacterial is best suited for the bacteria causing it. Urine analysis and culture (urinalysis and culture) can help in the assessment of a UTI. It also helps in the diagnosis of other conditions that cause irritation of the bladder and kidney disease and to assess for any bacteria that causes the UTIs. Sometimes UTIs can cause kidney damage if not treated immediately. So, therapy should be started even if there is no urine analysis and culture report. However, the need for urine analysis and culture may remain in these cases. This will help the doctor to obtain more information on treating the bacteria that causes a UTI."}

{"text": "Question: ,Can a squint eye be corrected? \n ### Answer: The medical treatment normally used is a type of squint-strabismus surgery. If patients are selected properly and the level of surgery is technically appropriate, the surgery may eliminate the visual axis misalignment and closed off the deviated eye producing an effective realignment of the visual axis. This, in turn, may permit to use both eyes for near vision tasks and be restored to a single vision capable of performing near visual activities. In these circumstances, the final result of the surgery may be satisfactory. On the other hand, if the treatment does not meet these requirements, the squint may persist, which means that the surgical result could have led to a binocular vision impairment. The latter might imply a loss of stereopsis either experimentally or in real-life situations which would make the use of binocular vision impossible or difficult."}

{"text": "Question: ,Can a tooth abscess go away on its own? \n ### Answer: It is generally recommended to seek dental treatment for a tooth abscess because antibiotics alone will not cure the infection since the source of the infection, the abscess, remains in the tooth. However, some sources recommend antibiotics as a treatment option if the abscess is small and accessible with routine needle aspiration or if the patient is otherwise too compromised to be treated as indicated above. A prospective study of acute dental abscess in children in Thailand found that if treated with only antibiotics, approximately 25% of the abscesses resolved, while more than 80% of abscesses treated by dental means resolved . The authors of this study concluded that antibiotic treatment could be considered a safe and effective treatment option for certain pediatric dental abscesses . However, the necessity of emergency treatment of abscesses with infected teeth remaining was emphasized."}

{"text": "Question: ,Can ataxia be cured? \n ### Answer: There is currently no cure for ataxia, but significant medical advances are being made. Some ataxias may be reversed if the underlying cause is metabolic. For example, vitamin E has been shown to help slow the progression of Friedreich\u2019s ataxia . Exercise has been shown to provide some stability to ataxia, and new medications may stop degeneration and offer symptomatic relief . However, the degeneration of nerve cells cannot currently be reversed. Given the range of ataxia syndromes and etiologies, it is important to rule out and/or treat any of the underlying conditions that may be causing a person\u2019s ataxia symptoms (e.g., medication side effect, vitamin B12 deficiency, metabolic disorders, or lead or other intoxication) . If one of these associated conditions is contributing to the ataxia, treating the contributing condition may improve symptoms associated with the ataxia. Currently, there are no neuroprotective or neurorestorative drugs approved by the FDA for ataxia . What precepts of rehabilitation are applicable?Rehabilitation approaches are based on neuroscience theories and current research as well as the experiences of therapists and patients. A new treatment model, referred to as the restorative neuromuscular facilitation (RNF) technique, is based on the notion that, for ataxia, this approach is best suited to drive postural and balance improvements of postural instability. The RNF technique consists of the following key concepts: (i) techniques taking into account the involuntary movement; (ii) body reactions; and (iii) sensory modifications. The rationale behind the approach is to dynamically restore neurophysiological channels through reeducation of the involved neurophysiological and body reactions. This technique is applied through postural responses (PPPD), rhythmical and gyratory movements of the skull and thorax, and involvement of the head through sensory inputs. Literature suggests that it is important to create meaningful daily-life participatory experiences, as such experiences facilitate learning and improve function . Evidence suggests that although ataxic patients may be able to gather information regarding the nature of the impose motor tasks, this may not be sufficient to produce the desired learning . According to Franchakis et al. , experiences in early childhood are critical to the organization of motor abilities. A developmental and exper"}

{"text": "Question: ,Can be asthma be cured? \n ### Answer: Many people ask themselves this question and there is an disappointing answer to it. For example, scientists have not found a definitive diagnosis for asthma and not a curative treatment either, but they are getting closer to it, because they are following effective control treatments. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways and many factors contribute to this disease (Badawi, 2012). Among the causes of asthma can be the following: genetic predisposition, occupation, allergic sensitization, for example, from pollens or other air foreign particles (O3 and SO2); etc. Almost all patients have a common symptom such as wheezing, tight chest, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough, both at night and during the day, especially when they exert themselves (Schatz et al., 2010). However, asthma does not have a single way to be treated or cured, but it varies from patient to patient; it is always advisable to speak with a doctor and follow his opinion (Fernandes et al., 2012). In relation to genetic mechanisms one of the most important genes involved in both resistance to inflammation in asthma and in COPD is the gene code for the eosinophil-derived neuro toxin (EDN). Mutations of the EDN gene have been reported. HBEOS01 is a protein heterodimer (EDN P 50 variant) associated with bronchial epithelial cells and most important in the release of epithelial proinflammatory mediators in the small airways affected by inflammation and air pollution (Mills et al., 2001). If the mutation of the amino acid of the EDN is somehow strong, it can be prevented from exerting its inhibitory effects on eosinophils and neutrophils and thus promote edema and leukocyte hyper aggregation, which are processes that promote the occurrence of inflammation and pain (Dong and Li, 2011). Regarding environmental factors, many have been involved in triggering asthma, and one of the most indicated is indoor particulate matter (PM2.5), which besides affecting people with this disease, also affects people who are exposed and have never developed asthma (Epstein et al.,"}

Yes, there are different medications on the market that inhibit osteoclasts as well as medications that stimulate osteoblasts, leading to decreased or increased bone turnover, respectively. However, future studies are needed for regeneration of the bone matrix itself once it is lost, revolutionizing the treatment of bone diseases.Future studies should aim to incorporate different areas of science to develop novel approaches of bone tissue engineering.Certain diseases as well as genetic polymorphisms severely affect bone loss. How can we target the underlying mechanism of the bone loss and/or these diseases to improve bone fragility? Biological therapies are in development that aim to target cytokines, growth factors, and transcription factors involved in bone loss due to an underlying disease. Radicals will be used to reverse underlying DNA mutations associated with bone fragility."}

{"text": "Question: ,Can CFS be cured? \n ### Answer: There is no evidence-based standard for the best treatment of CFS. In a significant number of CFS patients, symptoms will continue or relapse after treatment, regardless of the type of treatment the patient receives. At present, medical knowledge cannot completely explain the cause of CFS, nor can conventional treatment completely cure CFS. Most patients have to learn to live with this sickness for the rest of their lives, although they can still achieve a certain degree of relief or control of the disease.Currently, there are many forms of treatment for CFS, but, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of a single treatment. The core treatment strategy of chronic fatigue syndrome is active rehabilitation with medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, and avoidance of additional physical stimulation. However, no specific treatment plan can be adapted to all patients. At present, the main treatment options for CFS include physical therapy, psychological intervention, and drug therapy.Acute symptomatic relief is mainly achieved through drug therapy. The purpose of drug treatment is to quickly relieve symptoms and make them resume normal life as soon as possible, so that they can work and study normally. Commonly used drugs for CFS patients include pain killers, anti-inflammatory drugs for muscle soreness and joint pain, sedatives for insomnia, antidepressants to improve mood, and anti-anxiety drugs. Treatment takes place in various forms of drug therapy. At present, based on national and international drug recommendations, the combination of antidepressants and gabapentin is recommended as the basic treatment for adults with CFS. Antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs, stimulants and other drug treatments can improve symptoms such as depression, sleep disturbances and pain.Drug treatment hardly cures CFS. It only plays a role in symptomatic relief and patients have to continue medication for a long time. During the use of antidepressants, patients must pay great attention to the adverse reactions of the drugs, which may cause new symptoms. The adverse effects of the drugs may be nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and sleepiness, especially antidepressants, which will cause jitteriness and easy irritability. With the exception of antidepressants, most medications have few side effects. The duration of drug treatment will be individualized. In general, there are two conditions that can reveal the effect of medication:The illness comes to a"}
{"text": "Question: ,Can chronic kidney disease be repaired? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes, but only if the underlying cause is identified and treated early. The most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden reduction in blood flow to the kidneys, which can occur as a result of dehydration, sepsis, or the use of nephrotoxic medications. If the cause of the reduced blood flow is addressed and adequate hydration is maintained, the kidneys may be able to recover their function over time. However, if the cause of the AKI is not addressed or if there is a prolonged period of reduced blood flow, the kidneys may not be able to recover their function. In this case, chronic kidney disease may develop, which can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant."}

{"text": "Question: 2,Can ectopic beats damage your heart? \n ### Answer: Inappropriate beats originating outside of the sinoatrial node will only affect an individual if it occurs in sufficient numbers to compete with the normal heart rate. If they occur at an infrequent rate, irregular migration of a perturbation may be the most serious concern. If then, these beats propagate through the walls of the chamber as a wave instead of synchronously, the heart can be incapable of pumping blood. This situation, called electromechanical uncoupling, can cause a surge of blood in that chamber, called ventricular tachycardia, and this can be fatal. If the tumor is not successful, depending on how many cells are interacted, the patient\u2019s heartbeat may be too fast, too slow or irregular.[34\u201336]"}
{"text": "Question: 3,Can ectropion fix itself? \n ### Answer: Lots of patients prefer conservative management if their ectropion stay close. For example some patients don\u2019t want any interventions even if they were aware that frequent discharge, epiphora and conjunctivitis will take place. The results of our systematic review showed 4.78%(6/128) recurrence of after resolving signs and symptoms of ectropion in conservative management group. This is comparable with Lilley\u2019s result that 9%(4/44)patients in observation group presented ectropion again (Lilley et al., 2009). In addition, our results showed that suture repair produced more satisfactory outcome than conservative therapy(97.3%vs 92.9%, P=0.048), so we can concluded that conservative management may not be enough to fix ectropion and surgery is the best solution. Apart from that, the treatment condition will be worse if the patients chose observation(Su vara et al., 2000)."}
{"text": "Question: 4,Can ejaculation disorders be cured? \n ### Answer: Yes, studies have shown that in patients with no prior gynaecological intervention, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory drugs could effectively cure the disease over time. However, studies have also shown that these patients can relapse following treatment. In patients presenting with postoperative adhesions, frequent sexual activity can help increase blood supply and facilitate treatment. For patients with adhesions secondary to infections, surgical excision can yield good results. However, for patients suffering from endometriosis-related ejaculatory pain, drugs that affect the sexual hormones such as danazol and GnRHa can effectively relieve pain. Nevertheless, side effects are common, and long-term use of drugs has not shown any additional treatment effects at this time."}
{"text": "Question: 5,Can empyema be cured? \n ### Answer: Most probably it is not. However, based on my experience in medical set up, I can say more than 70% of the cases with empyema respond to the standard treatment protocols. I want to emphasize that the successful outcome depends on the entire management of the case starting from the accurate diagnosis by clinicians including radiologists and pathologists, diagnosis by microbiologists, the handling of samples for sensitivity assessment perfectly by laboratory technologists, right doses administered by the pharmacists, and the appropriate responses based on the sensitivity outcome of the samples by physicians. Based on their previous cultural reports, high-level resistance to antibiotics is identified in almost all Sceptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia species and the failure of this bacteria in life may cause life-threatening sepsis because they are situated in host bodies\u2019 skin, throat, and colon. Escherichichia and Sretpococcus are in their source colonies. That is why empyema due to septicemia from such bacteria is more difficult to treat."}

Presently haemophilia A and B can be treated with either plasma derived or recombinant FVIII or FIX, but cures are being sought. Generally speaking, to be cured of a disease means that the cause of the disease is removed and the disease is no longer expressed or present. A cure for haemophilia would mean that FVIII is made in normal amounts in the body so that FVIII treatment is not necessary. Researchers are attempting to develop novel treatments whereby FVIII genes may be safely added to a person\u2019s body and that person\u2019s stem cells would then make FVIII protein. These researchers believe that they are getting very close, but they are not there yet. In the meantime although it can be very difficult, people with haemophilia continue to incubate their FVIII and convalesce from bleeds by following medical advice that includes resting, avoiding strenuous activity and taking sufficient rest so that their bodies are able to heal."}

{"text": "Question: 9,Can retinal detachment be cured? \n ### Answer: Some people will need to have retinal detachment surgery. However, not all people with retinal detachments need to be treated. The treatment of retinal detachment depends on several factors, including the quantity and location of retinal detachment.761222 Most retinal tears must be treated promptly, but the surgeon can wait a few days if the retinal detachment is small and does not involve the visual center of the eye. These cases should be closely observed in the hospital, and treatment is required if there is a sudden increase in detachment. However, retinal detachment involving the macula is an emergency, and treatment is required as soon as possible. If the retinal detachment is too extensive, and the risk of complications, such as cataracts in the lens is high, then eyes can be removed (enucleation).9,If my eyes are removed, will I lose my sight from the other eye? I have a family member who has lost his sight from both eyes. How can this happen? If one eye is removed, no matter what is done to the other eye, you will not be able to see from either eye.

Despite previous investigations, many events in the pathogenesis of SIDS remain unknown. Most studies have focused on the contribution of cardiorespiratory dysfunction and the role of proinflammatory cytokines. Other possible mechanisms for SIDS include hypoxia, a congenital defect or sleep apnea. Nutritional status might be underestimated among the occurrences of SIDS.83,84,85 The data reveal that breastfed children, above all infants who slept in their mother's room, have a lower risk of SIDS in relative to bottle-fed infants.18 The development of severe disease related to SIDS was found to be associated with malnutrition, muscle weakness, impaired heart rhythm, reduced arousal during sleep, molecular dysfunction, obesity, and/or increase in metabolism by the SIDS infants. Earlier studies recommend breastfeeding as an important strategy to reduce infant mortality. This may also be valid for the group of infants with sudden infant death syndrome, a last end of life event."}

{"text": "Question: 9,Can you cure lipedema with weight loss? \n ### Answer: Yes. Lipedema is characterized by fat cells that do not respond to normal mechanism of adipose cell enlargement and break down 4. However fat cells in general respond to starvation and will break down 4. If the fat cells break down, that means that observable fat loss has occurred. Hence, Lipedema does respond to weight loss. Certainly, this does not mean that weight loss will \u201ccure\u201d lipedema (ponential lipoatrophy will remain) nor does it mean that lipedema does not present with a component of insensitivity to the hunger/satiety mechanism 4, so maintaining appropriate body size and caloric intake through starvation is critical. Loss of even a few pounds of fat in lipedema might provide enormous feedback through less compression of lymphatics and capillaries and this might actually help template for an eventual thinner more typical sized body. In particular, since obesity is a sedative, thinning out the body might also provide an increase in arousal.However, the recovery of a thin body will not occur via the overt mechanism in which Lipedema is gathered up, digested and excreted (in which case, it would not be an eating disorder).Instead inhibited pluripotency of skin fat cells 6, or cell differentiation arrest 4, is the mechanism by which lipedema fat cells appear to resist weight loss 4 (inhibited pluripotency pathways create a resistance to diet and loss in a way that dysfunction of hunger/satiety sensing might), and since this is the mechanism, it means that starvation (a \u201cdiet\u201d) is not readily effective for lipedema.An obese body is a dampened sensory body, another kind of silencingBody size 12."}

{"text": "Question: 2,Can you fully recover from a subdural hematoma? \n ### Answer: Yes, subdural hematoma is considered a reversible injury, and most patients who undergo medical treatment fully recover ( \u25b6 13).3,Will your child sustain any permanent brain damage as a result of this brain injury? That is difficult to predict (\u25b6 15). However, the successful treatment of traumatic brain injury by therapeutic hypothermia has led to fewer instances of severe disability (ESC guidelines). Conversely, research shows that every day that the brain remains warm after an acute brain injury contributes to permanent damage. Also, if the patients remain in a coma for longer than 48\u201372 h, there is a higher probability of irretrievable brain damage, and the chance of recovery decreases (\u00c8tienne et al., 2001).4,Does the timing of the clot removal influence the degree of recovery ( \u25b6 23)? The exact role of urgent neurosurgery for subdural hematoma has not been established. Azaiez et al., (2008) found no significant difference between urgent neurosurgery and medical treatment in their systematic review and concluded that there is not enough data to suggest an urgent neurosurgical approach in the management of children with a subdural hematoma ( \u25b6 11).5,What are the signs and symptoms of a secondary brain injury?

Causes of halitosis are varied, and they can be treated in many ways, such as medication, mouthwash, intra oral appliances, changing lifestyle, and so on. Regarding treating halitosis, the most important thing is to find the root cause in addition to paying attention to how it can be treated.

{"text": "Question: 0,Can you have a heartbeat but no pulse? \n ### Answer: \u25a0 Yes, but blood still circulates around the body.A heartbeat is the rhythmic beating of the heart, while a pulse refers to the rhythmic pressure detected by the blood pressure cuff. Thus, a heartbeat can occur in the absence of a pulse and vice versa since there is overlap in the magnitude and periodicity between the two spectra. Furthermore, the fact that clinicians use both words interchangeably means that the general public is likely to as well."}
{"text": "Question: 1,Can you have pancreatic cancer for years without knowing? \n ### Answer: There have been descriptions in the literature of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who had been suffering from uncomplicated pancreatitis. Carcinoma of the pancreas may mimic chronic pancreatitis radiographically as well as pathologically . Often symptoms of pancreatic cancer are quite similar to those of chronic, inflammatory, pancreatitis: abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, vomiting . Therefore family history could be critical in identifying family members at risk for pancreatic cancer and imaging could be considered.2,What are CSF markers in patients with PDAC?2.1 Why is the AUROC for CA 19-9 >10?The AUROC curve can be considered a measurement for an in vitro diagnostic test. It measures the test's capability to distinguish two groups of individuals: diseased/positive and non-diseased/negative. The AUROC can be considered to be equivalent to the probability that the test will rank a randomly chosen individual with the disease higher than a randomly chosen individual without the disease. According to the ranges given in Table 9 the AUROC for CA 19-9 indicates that this biomarker is a \"fair\" diagnostic test and has some drawbacks. This is in agreement with the available literature supporting that CA 19-9 should not be used alone to screen pancreatic cancer. Ruth et al. performed the EpHPCC demonstration project and reported CA 19-9 elevation in 5.8/1000 individuals in a mailed-out study. In their analysis Ruth et al. evaluated the characteristics of these individuals diagnosing pancreatic cancer over a period of 7 years by follow-up examinations. Of this group of 5764 persons, only 60 person (1.02 %) ultimately had pancreatic cancer (after second endosonographic screen) . This suggests that CA19-9 elevation cannot be used alone to diagnose pancreatic cancer but rather serves as a notable biomarker. Optimizing biomarkers, the biology of the tumors and the quest for novel molecular targets are the goals in a more complicated disease like pancreatic cancer. Therefore the next biomarker to be discussed in this section (CA 19-9"}

{"text": "Question: 2,Can you still walk with a dislocated knee? \n ### Answer: I guess not. Reason that the knee \u201cdislocated\u201d is that it was loose/unstable in the first place, either from degenerative arthritis or physeal growth plates/ligaments/tendons. It seems the femur just slid off of the tibia, signal/noise/original ligamentous attachments become discontinious when the two bones separate (post-\u201cdislocation\u201d). Since the femoral-tibial joint surface is missing, there is no muscle tension involved to stabilize the joint. Therefore, I argue that the statement, \u201cWe postulate that the femur dislocated posteriorly with the subsequent self-reduction to the epicondylar bone fragment.\u201d is not likely to have happened the way shown in Figures 2 and 5. The femur likely \u201cdislocated\u201d and then subsequently \u201cdislocated\u201d again, in which posterior slipping forward and repositioning in the opposite direction contributed to the final joint reduction."}

Can people get hypersensitive to lactose oxenosis? Being a hypersensitive Cow\u2019s Milk Protein Allergy means, I can\u2019t eat any products that contain milk, right?Lactose intolerance can develop as people get older when as a child, they could tolerate milk or dairy products without experiencing any issues. Lactose intolerance can also occur following acute gastroenteritis, which may lead to damage to the small intestine and a subsequent decrease in the ability to digest lactose. It can occur secondary to certain medical conditions such as hepatitis, HIV, and biliary cirrhosis. Under these conditions, individuals with no history of lactose intolerance may develop lactose malabsorption due to decreased absorption of disaccharide transporter SGLT1 from damaged enterocytes (2). Lactose malabsorption can be attributed to a reduction in the absorption of lactose rather than to hypersensitivity to cow\u2019s milk proteins. During lactose malabsorption, hypolactasia leads to a reduction in the absorption of lactose, regardless of the intake of cows\u2019 milk products and those lactose intolerant people can ingest lactose-containing products without any intestinal symptoms (2)."}

{"text": "Question: 8,Can you survive aneurysm in the brain? \n ### Answer: What are the outcomes? Hi shem, the chances of surviving a ruptured aneurysm are high if it is treated in a timely manner. The patients can also survive an unruptured aneurysm if it is treated at the correct time. Him, some of the consequences of surviving a ruptured aneurysm can be epilepsy, weakness, paralysis and coma in the worst case. The sudden haemorrhage from the neurovascular system can be fatal as well. It all depends on many other factors like the location, size and age of the patient. Should I check out what happens in the long-run. I'm not sure. Hi sham, the long-term consequences depend upon the compression experienced on the brain structures, whether it's a ruptured or unruptured aneurysm. A ruptured aneurysm gives the brain extra space but after clot formation due to bleeding, there's no extra space so that leads to permanent damage. A growing aneurysm before it's treatment compresses the brain structures leading to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid but the brain has the ability to bounce back and further compression leads to increasing brain damage. An unruptured aneurysm stays this way until it ruptures or an angiographic intervention is performed."}

We also lack a deep understanding for the formation mechanism of the reaction products.CRemoval of silica from the lungs mainly depends on pulmonary surfactants: the smaller, the less. Silica particles up to 50 nm stay in the lungs indefinitely. Nanoparticles might thus be more harmful due to a higher surface microcrack area (which increases dissolution and therefore harmfulness)CRepeated respirable exposures to nano/microparticles, both inorganic or biological, can induce metallic toxicity: the smaller the particle, the higher the oxidative potential. Oxidative stresses are linked to genotoxicityEnergy barriers for monodentate and bidentate metals replacing O2\u2212 ions and for interstitial metals forming M\u2013O bonds in the first coordination sphere of the silica network are different and might add up in a biased way to complex oxidative stress"}

{"text": "Question: 4,Do narcoleptics sleep at night? \n ### Answer: Most patients sleep between 6 and 9 hours per night, which appears to be a normal amount of time. However, nighttime sleep in narcolepsy is often sleepless, fragmented, and shallower than routine sleep. Several studies indicate that sleep structure in narcolepsy conforms to external demands partially. It tends toward normalization during vacations or illness, regression toward deeper and more continuous sleep when the bed partner is unaware of the narcoleptic's condition, and disruption when traveling in unfamiliar surroundings .The question of whether narcoleptics have an underlying sleep pattern consistent with normal sleep leads to a discussion of various theories of the functions of sleep. The most widely credited function of sleep is a business one: it restores motional and cognitive abilities. The obvious implication of this theory is that narcolepsy deviates from normal sleep because of motional and cognitive instability; the sleep deprivation exacerbates weaknesses, but does not cure them. Other influential theories include the concept of sleep as a defense. Sleep is often perceived as an inactive state; however, sleep is known to be metabolically active. To forestall various troublemakers during the mostly inactive state of sleep, foods and drugs, defensive systems have developed. Sleep is also considered a wastebasket for abnormal mental activity. Even some researchers argue that REM sleep activity likely reflects pathology .The question of whether the sleep pattern in narcolepsy is consistent with normal sleep has implications for treatment. It does not make as much sense to treat the sleep problems in narcolepsy with CMH if the sleep pattern is not the same in both narcolepsy and normal sleep patterns."}

It can result in anemia, hemolysis, bleeding of the gums, delayed healing of wounds and decreased immunity. People can get scurvy if they do not eat foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits and tomatoes, for more than 3 months.As long as you have a balanced diet and eat fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, generally speaking, you are unlikely to suffer from vitamin deficiencies."}

{"text": "Question: 5,Do worms go away on their own? \n ### Answer: Worms are uncommon in the developed countries. In areas that are endemic, if a person is infected with amoeba, it spontaneously goes away in between 4 to 6 weeks. This is because of self-destructive nature of the amoeba in the human intestine, i.e., it will ingest itself. Hence, it is a self-limiting infection.6,How can they be treated?All cases respond well to treatment. Treatment should be started as soon as possible because delay in treatment will prolong the symptoms. It may give rise to complications such as lung abscess.26~28 Treatment consists of administration of metronidazole for 7 days, along with supportive measure including antipyretics, fluid and electrolyte management, nasogastric suctioning of the gastric contents and parenteral nutrition.7,What are the chronic complications of amoebiasis?The chronic complications of amoebiasis include ulcerative perianal disease, intestinal strictures and malabsorption.

In this situation the tumor leads to strong pain in the pelvic region, to blood in the urine or may even cause an obstruction of the urinary tract.5,If I have bladder cancer, have I also cancer in the other organs?It is very rare, that people with bladder cancer have cancer in other organs as well. In most cases, the origin of the tumor cells is the urinary bladder.6,Will my bladder be removed when I suffer from bladder cancer?In every single case, the removal of the bladder is the final therapy if the bladder is involved by the tumor. This therapy is called cystectomy. Sometimes a cystectomy is performed for other reasons as well.7,What are the typical symptoms of bladder cancer?As described above, the most typical symptoms are the presence of blood in the urine, and an urge to urinate more frequently than usual. However, in most cases, the first signals of bladder cancer are not noticed from these symptoms. Sensitive bladder or urinary tract infection may cause similar complaints. The main problem seems to be that the symptoms of bladder cancer are often overlooked. Therefore there is a big need for information to make patients and the public more sensitive for the symptoms of bladder cancer. This issue will be even discussed in more detail in the next section.Fig. 2Getting acquainted with the series \u201cMISS SCIENCE\u201d.

The knowledge of the risk factors associated with HAV infection could have a direct impact on the workup of asymptomatic patients. If patients think their positive serum HBV markers are the result of illicit drug use, they will likely avoid seeking care. Our results in contrast suggest that at least 75% of cases acquire infection from food- or water-borne sources. Therefore, emphasis on personal health practices including good personal hygiene and sanitary measurements are vital to avoid a surge of foodborne disease outbreaks."}

{"text": "Question: 3,How do humans get toxoplasmosis? \n ### Answer: Anyone can get toxo by ingesting undercooked or raw meat containing tissue cysts. Cats are the only known definitive host for Toxoplasma. Cats can excrete the parasite in their feces, which contains the infective form known as oocyst. These oocysts can survive in the environment for several years. A person can acquire toxoplasmosis by eating undercooked meat containing the parasite and by ingesting food or water contaminated with oocysts. The most common way humans get toxo is by eating undercooked or raw meat containing tissue cysts. Cats become infected by eating small birds and rodents that are infected with the parasite. In cats, the parasite undergoes asexual reproduction, and at the end of the digestion process in the small intestine, millions of oocysts are released into the cats' intestine, where they remain infectious for up to several years. Oocysts are then passed out in the feces, where they can remain viable for years in a soil or sandy-soil environment. About 30% of cats will shed oocysts a second time somewhere from 2 to 9 months later. Humans get toxo from ingestion of secretory oocysts. Human result from contaminated food or water. A number of other things people can toxo also include: Eating vegetables that have been fertilized by oocysts-contaminated cat feces. However, oocysts would also require this soil to be eaten to infect Lived-in house or day care center where a cat has passed with oocysts in its feces. Conversion of tissue cysts in undercooked meat to the infective form of tachyzoites can also lead to disease onset. People get toxo from undercooked or improperly handled previously frozen meat. Among other ways the parasite can get is: Organ transplantation. The illness can be caused by ingestion of tissue cysts in raw or undercooked meat of an infected intermediate host, the consumption of oocysts in undercooked meat, the ingestion of tissue cysts in water while washing undercooked meat, or the ingestion of oocysts present in a cat ur"}

Three hormones called oestrogens help with your skin changes . These hormones relax your muscles and make your blood vessels get bigger [1, 5].ACTIVITY: Going to the toilet or taking a shower should relieve itching.Giving birth increases oestrogen levels in your blood. A high level of oestrogen throughout pregnancy is associated with itchy skin . It is also important to note that babies in the womb receive oestrogen from their mothers.So, your itchy bum is probably not due to pregnancy but because your blood vessels are expanding faster than your skin can expand to cover them.THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND almost all the common skin conditions are not pregnancy related! Men, children and people of all ages get skin problems and your partner may also be showing trout spot on their bum as men also have oestrogen in their body. These do not mean that your partner is getting pregnant. Knowing what to expect and the common complaints that arise at different times should clear up 80% of problems.

In fact, sleep disturbance is an independent risk factor for falls and psychological distress in older adults . Encourage a consistent routine; maintain a regular bedtime and wake-up time; and limit exposure to electronic media, such as television, cell phones, and other devices. Look into the lighting conditions in resident rooms.IsometricsTM, a therapy system that uses low-level TV-like LED lighting, is a therapeutic atmosphere developed by Dr. Frank Merchant and used primarily for dementia care units to help reduce sleep problems. It minimizes the potential for sundowning and decreases disruptions during the night. The lighting mimics natural light, so residents can differentiate night from day, and is adaptive to residents\u2019 needs. Assistive technology, such as bed/chair sensors, can monitor residents and identify patterns of movement and inactivity. Caregivers, through the alarm feature in these systems, can be notified of change in motion (e.g., a resident is out of bed, pacing, or wandering, or when an individual wakes up at night). Caregivers can also monitor activities in real-time. A call system links to an interactive emergency call console/central station, offering important tools like real-time resident locations and one-touch emergency notification to designated staff members, providing rapid response to those with emergent needs ."}

{"text": "Question: 4,How do I get rid of a fungal infection in my nail? \n ### Answer: If the discoloration and thickness of your fingernail is due to a fungal infection, there are a number of options to treat it, including over-the-counter antifungal lid ointments, such as clotrimazole or, ontesome topicals, but they have not been extensively studied in the nails. There are several FDA-approved treatments for fungal nail infections. Terbinafine hydrochloride (degree of cure, oral), which is a white tablet, is the most strongly supported medication in the evidence-based literature. It is applied for 12\u201324 weeks and comes in a dosage of 250-per-day dose. Some possible side effects include headache, abnormal liver function, rash, pruritus, paint discontinuation, and remission. Conversely, fluconazole, another commonly prescribed antimycotic drug, is a water-soluble triazole molecule, meaning it is absorbed and increases in liver and body's tissues leading to prolonged half-life and milder responses like diarrhea, rash, or headache. It may require 8 weeks to full 16 weeks of treatment based on type of fungal agent and the preparation may come as a capsule or liquid. Our patient was prescribed a 90-day course of Terbinafine hydrochloride due to the degree of cure hearing improvement and comedication of daily Prednisone."}
{"text": "Question: 5,How do I get rid of a mole? \n ### Answer: This study included an extra analysis for melanotic pigment cell tumor (MPN) and seborrheic keratosis (SK), as these tumors are often misclassified as \u201cmoles\u201d, and moreover, their diagnosis requires histological examination. The keywords \"seborrheic\u201d are presented in the text but not tested in the model, which is surprising. Overall, I think that this is a useful and easy-to-use tool for dermatologist and primary care physicians. However, as the authors state, the main limitation of the study, that is also shown in the analysis of MPN and SK, is the lack of external validation. Therefore, I strongly suggest to expand the panel of dermatologist in future studies and to test them on a panel of experts. Additionally, the method should be published in a peer-reviewed journal in order to improve potential limitations. Further, the tool could be improved by classifications on specific subgroups of skin cancers, such as melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, which would be of major interest for clinicians. Moreover, the tool could also provide information regarding the etiology and the personal medical history of the patient."}

At what week should you notice them?Most miscarriages happen before the fourth week of pregnancy. If you have any symptoms of a miscarriage, call your doctor right away.Is a miscarriage a pregnancy?A miscarriage is a complication of pregnancy. If a miscarriage occurs before the 20th week of pregnancy, some women may not even be aware they were pregnant.A miscarriage before the 20th week would be \"not a pregnancy\" as it does not go period.How do I know I\\'m pregnant after the 20th week?There\\'s usually no way to tell if a pregnant woman will have a miscarriage or not.What is the normal fetal heart rate range?During the development of the fetus, activity of its heart can be detected during the 5th week of pregnancy. It can be noted on trans-vaginal ultrasounds during the 7th week. Between 11 and 13 weeks, the fetal heart rate is 110 to 160 beats/min.That means - at least with normal fetal heart rate only - from the 7th week a normal fetal development can be noted, which is around the same time it would be possible to confirm the pregnancy when it was done the old ways (sic!).So it is not a child until at least 11 weeks?

The DC corresponds to the sound intensity at which the individual begins to feel discomfort and then pain. The DP is also termed the pain threshold31.The most useful parameters of the characterization of hyperacusis are LDL and DC, as they are simple to measure and repeatable. DC reflects the clinically relevant auditory characteristic because it indicates the sound level that must be avoided by the individual with hyperacusis."}

Lipedema is a specific diagnosis based on the presence of certain physical symptoms and the absence of others. For example, patients with lipedema often report feeling like their legs \"stick\" to the bed sheets or compared their skin to \"elephant flesh.\" Patients with lipedema often avoid wearing fitted clothes, and their skin may be overheated compared to the rest of their body. Lipedema can be diagnosed based on the Fortain criteria following clinical evaluation and imaging findings, which typically show disproportionate amount of adipose tissue at the limb compared to the rest of the body. Other forms of obesity result in an indiscriminate deposition of generalized fat throughout the body. Accurately distinguishing between lipedema and obesity is essential for proper treatment plan, since the treatments for these conditions are significantly different."}

If the fluid accumulates within the pleural space too rapidly (e.g. in acute infections, pulmonary embolism), it may displace the lung, so that no signs of pleurisy are noticed.If the fluid accumulates slowly, it eliminates interstitial fluid from the pleural space.

If your jaw pain is more than mild and lasts more than a few weeks, you should see a health-care provider to rule out heart problems.The odds of having heart problems are higher if the pain is constant or dull, is mildly painful, or is accompanied by a musty odor (which can occur when teeth decay).My heart has normal beats but I have occasional irregular beats and forthbeats as I eat.Are there any heart risks?Irregular beats are common in people who do not have heart disease, and are usually not a cause for concern.Multiple studies have concluded that high levels of throat-related soft tissue inflammation are associated with atherosclerosis, an indicator of future risk of coronary heart disease.If you have existing heart disease, your heart arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) or subsequent strokes could be worsened by sweets.Eating a very sweet diet may increase arrhythmia-related events in patients with coronary heart disease.(2) Pain and/or Discomfort Categorized into Body Part(3) Duration of ComplaintaMedian(Range) Secondsa36 (36\u2013750)(2) Pain and/or Discomfort Categorized into Body Part(4) Movement During Activity Categorized into Body Part Any movement exacerbated the following symptoms body part(5) Interference with Activity Categorized into Body Part Categorized into Activity (10% Below) Interference with work(6) Activities Related to Impact Score on QOL (10% Below) Interaction of pain with other symptoms Annoying(7) Impact Symptom Score on QOL Disease-related impactaThose characteristics that clearly inferred the presence of a disease such as use of medication, hospitalization and interventionist consultations.

It is important to note that these patients typically have a cough with either hemidiaphragmatic or inspiratory dysfunction or in some cases offer suggestions of pulmonary clot embolism or maybe an indirect sign of infection.

It is a common claim that herbs induce detumescence even when prescribed long after the onset of priapism and repeated doses of benzodiazepine and alfacholodopamine are administeredIt really is not easy to respond to your concern. In fact, in order to prescribe a specific medication to reverse the erection, clinicians need to know exactly the duration (24, or > 48 h) of the priapism episode. In case of priapism, the use of adenosine or alfacholodopamine should be avoided. The other medication that has been used with some reported success is cryotherapyParadoxically, small doses of these compounds can even worsen the priapism once this event startsThese prompt me to recommend you to visit the hospital with all emergency features if your priapism lasts for 8 h. If it lasts for more than 24 h, you should visit traditional practitioner since at this moment the allopathic drugs are not the best option for youMany parents in the African context are unable or unwilling to consult outside the norm of our cultural context. It is therefore often difficult for practitioners from beyond to intervene on cases at presentation because some of the symptoms may have been medically documented in the hospital but remain untreated in the culture treatment centers and the patients are usually brought very late, past hope in modern medicine. It is also important to note that in many such instances, additional traditional care (herbal or spiritual care) is desirable, often obtained immediately or on stand-by, within the family compound in many instances. The priest or spiritual leader is usually very close to the patient as well. In traditional spiritual practice, conjuring or appeasement of wrathful ancestral spirits or malevolent spiritual influences that are thought to instigate priapism (e.g. procured blood during ritual slaying of a covenant ancestor who usually died from a grotesque penile erection; spirits of the dead who die thirsty and whose ancestral ability to initiate sexual procreation is impaired, etc.) will be closely linked to the cure of the symptom. There are also running hypotheses in the civil society that many rural communities"}

Some people infected with a tapeworm pass proglottids (fluke sections) in their stool.7 It is also possible for a tapeworm to migrate to organs (especially the brain) and cause cysticercosis or neurocysticercosis (NCC).8,9 There are no sensitive or specific tests to diagnose tapeworms. However, an examination of stool samples using the egg stool test (EST), or a microscope, may show tapeworm eggs, but diagnosis requires confirmation in a laboratory, because other parasite eggs look alike5.Because of this, it is necessary to suspected tapeworm infection if there are motile scolices or proglottids in a stool.10,11 It is also necessary to consider if there are cysts in other organs, such as in brain or muscles. The most direct method to diagnose a tapeworm is to visualize the worm; however, in most cases it is difficult because the worms reside inside the gastrointestinal tract. A definitive parasite identification is possible only by morphological and/or molecular/serological analyses of uterine scolices, proglottids, or dead tapeworms.10"}
{"text": "Question: 2,How do people deal with pain? \n ### Answer: Pain is a dangerous warning signal, and it drives action. Signaling theory states that the signals are sent, they are received and they are read. The sender controls the type of signal to transmit and the strength of that signal. The receiver has the greatest degree of control over the effectiveness of the swift reaction to a signal. The receiver detects the specific signals and assigns a value to them in order to calibrate a response to the pain they are experiencing. The vast majority of painful sensations are controlled at one of these three boundaries, and the pain we experience is a function of all three factors interacting into different levels of overall pain perception. People are incredibly resilient, and optimal pain perception and management achieves satisfaction, allows activities of daily living, and prevents future discrimination of pain sensation and subsequent chronic pain (5)."}

{"text": "Question: 7,How do you cure shin splints fast? \n ### Answer: Two methods have been proposed that are guaranteed to relieve shin splints. One way is to stop running until your pain is gone to minimize your body\u2019s reparatory biological response . This is not recommended because your pain is your most important guide; learning to run through the pain instead of running from the pain is one of the keys to successful running . The other way is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication i.e. ibuprofen, naproxen and other NSAIDS. Medication may reduce the recovery time from about 7 weeks to 2-3 weeks . NSAIDS are not effective in reducing recurrence rates over the longer run; therefore, they may only be appropriately prescribed for an acute episode of shin splints."}

{"text": "Question: 2,How do you fix a mallet finger? \n ### Answer: The authors cite a study from 2016 that reported 71% of 109 operated mallet fingers failed by recurrent flexion. However, this paper is only a series and has a host of problems including small sample size, missing data, baseline characteristics and outcomes without information on what criteria were considered as a treatment success or failure.7,8 There should be a clarification or formal update of the literature, accounting for patient preference, associated injury, associated infections, and follow-up period. In the orthopedic treatment of mallet fingers injured in a work setting, significant bony enlargement and flexion contractures at the PIP joint develop in some patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with mallet finger deformities and it is not uncommon to find Heberden's nodules present at the PIP joint. In this case, the patient is unable to extend the small fingertip because of bony enlargement and ligamentous fixation in flexion and the treatment involves PIP joint fasciotomy. There has been recent report on the surgical treatment of mallet fingers in industrial settings, but the available data is limited to short-term follow-up with small population sizes.9 How to account for preference for knowing if future development of symptoms is more or less likely in patients that opt for operative versus non-operative treatment and the influence of these factors on attending clinicians, and the power and precision of their findings in addressing these questions."}

{"text": "Question: 8,How do you know if you\\'ve got quinsy? \n ### Answer: 4,Did you take anything else?Quinsy is an infection of the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck and can be divided into two types: suppurative tonsillitis followed by peritonsillar abscess and acute retropharyngeal abscess, characterized by swelling of tonsils, fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, tonsillar tenderness, palatal pallor and pain with swallowing . The patient described in this scenario presented with a swollen throat; however, swelling of the tonsils is also observed in IBD, which can lead to tonsilloliths and tonsillitis which was evident from the previous history. Differentiating between IBD and an unrelated coital swelling or other systemic immunological disorders requires detailed history taking and clinical examination which is not provided.The patient with quinsy described in this scenario would present with fever however the clinical scenario does not provide evidence of this 1.75.Describe how you would assess the patient\u2019s airway:In both case scenarios, the clinical information provided does not allow for a detailed assessment of the airway, and the patients\u2019 abilities to maintain their own airway are unknown. However, due to the severe quality of life limiting pain presented in both scenarios, it is essential that a thorough assessment and a management plan for the airway is put in place in order to reduce any further discomfort or distress to the patients. 8,The patient should lie back with the neck slightly extended. Inspect and palpate for any swelling or midline deviation. A tongue prognathism suggests a retropharyngeal abscess. Audible stridor indicates laryngeal edema which is a rare, but urgent complication . Bedside accommodation and sitting positions are not recommended as the head is often flexed forward to accommodate bulky stoma, making airway inspection and evaluation difficult. Measures must not be delayed to get the patient lying safely in a suitable position for the assessment.5,If the pharynx is uncertain to be swollen, patient should be laid down but slight neck extension should be avoided as it may spread the fluid to the anterior neck.In both case scenarios, it is highly likely that pharyngeal assessment will be difficult due to edema, inflammation or pain. If this is the case and the patient is lying supine, tilt the"}

{"text": "Question: 7,How do you make an IO game? \n ### Answer: I can certainly help you make an IO game! In fact, I've spent a great deal of time working on these very kinds of games. However, the reality is that there are many approaches to creating the kind of game you want to make. A crucial decision will be to identify exactly what you mean by an IO game and what you want to accomplish by creating one. Once you've done that, I think there are a number of translational steps you can follow to realize your goals. Unfortunately, this journal simply doesn't have enough room to fully lay out all the steps you would need to follow in order to make a good IO game. However, I can at least go through the major steps that you will need to consider and provide you with a bit more detail on some of the key steps along the way.\u2022Identify the goal of your work. I want to emphasize that identifying your goal will be the most important step in the whole process. You see, there are many ways to create IO games, and it will be crucial to decide exactly what you want to achieve in order to identify the right approach for you. For example, let's say that you want to create a serious educational game that is highly effective at improving learners' comprehension of IO concepts. This is a very different goal from that of a designer who wants to create just a fun IO game for players to while away a few minutes of free time. In fact, if you are focused on creating a serious educational game, you should probably not follow many of my suggestions, as they will all be geared toward creating a fun, engaging game that learners will want to try again and that will keep them engaged from beginning to end. On the other hand, if you are primarily interested in creating an effective educational game, I can give you a VERY rough overview of the steps I would take; however, I can't give you the kind of guidance you will really need to successfully create the kind of effective game you have in mind. The point I want you to take away from this section is that defining the goal of your game is crucial and that you must be very clear about the goal you are wanting to achieve before you can decide how to go about it.\u2022What abilities and knowledge should the learners have before they begin playing the game? Once you have identified your goal, you should decide on the learner abilities and knowledge that players should have or that they will need in order to play successfully. Think of the"}

A patient complaining of general bad breathe may also need a treatment plan aimed to treat the development of periodontal disease due to the fact that periodontal disease is the number one reason for bad breathe.A periodontal assessment is a very significant component in determining the severity of the condition and in deciding the most significant treatment approach.

Further therapy will always depend on the severity of the disease as well as on the patient\u2019s response to treatment. Tissue debridement, flap surgery, and procedures aimed to reduce bacterial counts associated with periodontitis is also used.

{"text": "Question: 5,How do you treat a weak pulse? \n ### Answer: Increase of the contractile volume is another diagnostic category and implies changes in contractility. Clinically, arrhythmia, shock and tension of the myocardium are likely to be encountered as well. Therefore, correcting ABO and/or HM may be effective choice or countermeasure when dealing with weak pulse. 6,Weak pulse in type B is due to low stroke volume.Any patient suffering from a weak pulse needs to be sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Heart failure is a priority, and some of the necessary procedures include clearing the airways with the Heimlich manoeuvre, CPR, defibrillator, etc. According to speed of onset, the condition can be divided into the following two categories.patient 9 male aged 28 years old, 10 days after illness, feeling full without vomiting, feeling bloated, feeling heavy head, difficulty starting urinating, having thick amber urine, Diarrhoea from time to time.weak pulse emerge in 30 minutes after eating dinner?About 50 % of arrhythmia patients experience sudden death or syncope known as sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The fatality rate is about 70 % if it happens at home or about 55 % among those who experienced SCA in public places . Sometimes, you will find excessive chest motion and laboured breathing due to some occurrences like pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade, massive blood loss, and pulmonary emphysema. It may also happen from chest trauma, myocarditis, acute asthma, or intense exercise. Choking, hyperventilation, or hypoventilation may cause hyper kalemia, hypotension, hypothermia, asphyxia, or hypoxia. The arrhythmia is less likely to occur when there is no extreme chest movement. Sometimes it can happen in otherwise normal situation. For instance, a few percent of SCA victims are among young people who do not have any history of heart problems. A considerable part of SCA victims were found in their sleep. This is probably a result of an undetected heart disease."}

{"text": "Question: 8,How do you treat boils and carbuncles? \n ### Answer: Boils and carbuncles can appear anywhere on the body, commonly in the armpits, face, buttocks, thighs, and buttocks. They are highly contagious and may cause high fever.[19, 20] Routine washing of bodily areas which have boils, avoiding sharing personal items such as towels and clothing, avoiding close contact with others, and observing isolation of infected individuals are important to prevent the spread of infections. HEAT in the guidelines for infection prevention and control for nurse care is recommended for wound cleaning. Putting hot compresses on the lesions frequently help to nurse the swelling and to minimize the bacterial growth. Hemorrhagic bullae due to trauma accompanied by pus are not sterile. Anti-infective treatment should be administered in conjunction with regular treatment, but in cases where the lesions continue to enlarge and redness and fever appear, doctor's consultations and minor surgery to release the swollen lesions should be recommended . Chinese medicine drainage and baking must not be used . Before performing surgery, povidone iodine will be used to wash the location of the boil, preventing infections after surgery. Healing ointment is also applied, such as using newborn colostrum. The reason for the effectiveness of newborn colostrum is that it contains varieties of growth and metabolism factors, alkaline phosphatase, puromycin adenosine nucleotide pyrophosphatase, glutathione dehydrogenase, lectin, macrophages, spermin, lactoferrin, and so on. And colostrum is better than antibiotic therapy, because of the problem with the overuse of antibiotics and bacterial resistance. Besides, in several occasions, no matter how intense the carbuncle is, antibiotics often have no effect on them. Dermelastin capsule is also a good material to promote wound healing. It is a good hemostaticic for internal and external use, because of the properties of high protein and coagulation effect. Dermelastin capsule can increase local tissue elasticity, improve skin aging symptoms and wound repair, and also prevent scarring and pigmentation."}

Cancer can occur in any part of the body. All students expressed that cancer can develop in any part of the body if the lifestyle is not appropriate. Some common beliefs were that if blood vessels or the brain was damaged from exposure to toxic substances or stress this could cause cancer. In addition, the students believed that genetic disorders could also cause cancer. 2. Ages between 50 and 60 years old is when someone can be affected by cancer. Everyone stated that cancer happened around the ages between 50 and 60 years old and sometimes younger. 3. Elderly people often have cancer. All the students thought that elderly people had a higher risk for having and developing cancer in their body.

{"text": "Question: 7,How does dysarthria affect communication? \n ### Answer: Dysarthria affects communication by impairing all aspects of speech production including breathing, phonation, articulation, prosody, and prosodic modulation of tone (8). While dysarthria is an STNOS with an organic basis, transient organic brain syndromes of communication (TOBSC) have a more limited time frame. Is the acute event a factor? 9,Based on current data, are there any successful treatments or interventions for presbycusis? While there is no unifying treatment for hearing loss due to presbycusis, hearing aids have been shown to be effective in improving communication for most listeners with normal cognition. Assessments by an audiologist are recommended in all cases of hearing loss as they will determine whether a patient is a candidate for amplification and begin the process of auditory rehabilitation. Determining fit is a crucial step as matching hearing aids to patients is a complex process requiring careful consideration of multiple factors. 10, Based on current data, are there any successful treatments or interventions for presbycusis? There are very few neuroimaging studies of neurobiological underpinnings of presbycusis. Chi et al. (2020) compared patients with hearing loss to controls using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism, and diffusion tensor imaging techniques and found significant correlations with candidate genes and hearing acuity. 11,Based on current data, are there any effective interventions for tongue atrophy in the elderly.

{"text": "Question: 1,How is bone thinning treated? \n ### Answer: Osteoporosis is a generalized skeletal disorder of the bone characterized by low bone density, higher bone turnover and a predisposition to fractures . The management of osteoporosis is directed mainly to the reduction of the risk of fracture, primarily by optimizing the quality of bone mineral. Further measures include fall prevention and smoking cessation . The etiologies of osteoporosis vary and therefore management requires a personalized approach. Most commonly, glucocorticoids, maternal osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis are causes of osteoporosis. Osteopenia is defined as low bone mass with clinically normal standardized bone strength based on a T-score greater than or equal to -1 with a Z-score less than -1. Severity ranges from osteopenia, osteoporosis with normal bone mineral density and osteoporosis with low bone mineral density (osteosclerosis). All of these are relative to a peak standard population. Equally important in osteoporosis prevention and management is dietary intake of calcium provided by adequate dietary intake and/or intake through dairy products and calcium-enriched foods. Most cases manage well with management, however 10\u201315% of patients with advanced osteoporosis progress to a condition, whereby the affected bones cannot withstand the stress of every day movements, eventually leading to a bone fracture, especially in the vertebrae. At this stage, the patient is put on Treatment. In cases of secondary osteoporosis associated with malignancy resulting in hypercalcemia, control of the underlying cancer establishes the foundation of treatment. Bisphosphonates are a class of agents widely proven to be effective. Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphonate analogs with high affinity for hydroxyapatite that stabilizes them."}
{"text": "Question: 2,How is Cushing syndrome diagnosed? \n ### Answer: The cat must first of all undergo a complete physical exam, including all the senses. If signs of hypercorticism are confirmed during anamnesis or physical exam, it is necessary to start supplemental food and withdrawal of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to eliminate possible hyperadrenocorticism. At the same time, available diagnostic imaging exams of the anterior pituitary (transcranial or via the nose ultrasound, computed tomography, in rare cases magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) are usually conducted. Routine blood tests (urea, electrolytes (potassium and iodine), hematocrit, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus in the blood, complete blood count, liver value tests such as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase activity and alkaline phosphatase activity) can sometimes help to discriminate between the adrenal and pituitary conditions, depending on the presence of secondary effects of hypokalemia and/or hyperphosphatemia. After the diagnosis of hyperutilization of cortisol, a dynamic test is usually conducted that confirms the function of the adrenal cortex in pituitary-independent (lack of controlled supply to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) when hypercortisolemia is a dominant symptom) or hypopituitary (no supply to CRH caused by responses in the pituitary or adrenal glands).3,How is Cushing\u2019s syndrome treated?Cushing\u2019s treatment is usually conducted in a threefold approach conducted concurrently with laparotomy and adrenal tumor tissue removal or pituitary cecectomy followed by hormonal therapy and a healthy lifestyle. Lifestyle disorders can be controlled through providing a low-salt diet, ensuring proper sleep rest, alleviating physical stress 4, What are the prognoses after treatment?The prognoses after adrenalectomy are usually good and depend on the effectiveness of therapy. If the patient with Cushing\u2019s disease regains normal life condition, their lifespan does not differ from that in the normal population.

{"text": "Question: 4,How is myasthenia gravis diagnosed? \n ### Answer: [[N.B.: this question should be answered by discussing May-Thurner-associated myasthenia gravis and LEMP. Its explicit mention is not needed.]]In patients presenting with MG symptoms, the assessment begins with a complete review of the medical history, followed by a physical examination. If the patient has previously been diagnosed with MG, the consultation focuses on the patient's current symptoms and previous therapy. After obtaining the entire patient history, appropriate blood tests are performed, followed by NCS. Tensilon testing is performed in patients with OMG and some cases of thymoma-associated MG. However, it is not useful in other patients with MG. If patients show atypical presentations, further tests are needed. These include thyroid tests, blood tests for paraneoplastic antibodies, chest X-ray, thorax CT/MRI, gastrointestinal tests, single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG), and repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and LP. MRI of the tongue and ACL can help identify cranial MG. In addition, a microneural conduction study is performed.Genetic testing is done for MG in at-risk families. NCS is done for patients with proximal MG. If patients show negative results in NCS, single-fiber EMG is performed for confirmation. If the patients have evidence of paraneoplastic syndrome in the history on physical examination or MRI, they are examined for malignancies.Definitive diagnosis should be made only after taking at least a complete medical history of the patient's respiratory system, drug history, and other related history. The diagnosis can proceed to consider the physical exam, diagnostic tests, and previous treatment if needed. This makes the diagnosis criteria easy because it depends on clinical suspicion. Romano et al. and Hirano et al. proposed some criteria for the diagnosis of PMC syndrome. They recommended a complete history and clinical examination of the patient, followed by microneural conduction test, repetitive stimulation, and abnormal MRI features. The MGFA classification was claimed to be inappropriate, and the criteria of Romano and Hirano were proposed. Furthermore, considering the symptoms, submuscular involvement, abnormal MRI features, and performance of mielographic features, the diagnosis of PMC syndrome was made. Proph"}
{"text": "Question: 5,How is tonsillitis treated? \n ### Answer: Tonsillitis is generally considered to be a viral infection, although bacteria may also play a minor role. Studies have suggested that the role of bacteria in tonsillitis may be limited to suppressing the host's defenses, antagonizing viruses that may already exist, or interacting with viruses to enhance their pathogenicity. Generally, no treatment is required when having tonsillitis. Saltwater gargle may relieve the sore throat. Antibiotics are not necessary unless there is a secondary bacterial infection.6,What is the treatment for recurrent tonsillitis?There is some evidence to suggest that tonsillectomy, most commonly a partial tonsillectomy can be effective in treating recurrent tonsillitis, although a full tonsillectomy may be more effective.7,Do seasonal (spring) allergies cause tonsillitis?No, although some studies have suggested that allergy is associated with the onset of upper respiratory tract infections, including tonsillitis.8,What are the common causes of recurrent tonsillitis?There are a number of possible causes of recurrent tonsillitis. Research suggests that immune system issues and anatomical abnormalities of the tonsils may increase the risk of persistent inflammation. Moreover, some other pathogen factors such as Vaccinia virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Semliki forest virus, Valsa canescens, and Candida albicans also are often responsible for the occurrence of tonsillitis."}

During the 5 months following the transfer, he had difficulty walking and the inadequate compensation resulted in a slight drag. However, his ability to walk had improved since the FoG was applied, which enabled him to participate in social activities.Patient: I cannot walk fast. I'd like to try walking with a fast speed. PT: I will explain it to you when you walk fast. Today, you walked about five times. It was excellent.I will insert the Cr-1 crutch that is matching the FoG handle when walking and order you to walk fast in order to test your ability to walk fast.I tried walking fast, but had trouble with every step. Reciprocal innervation is also a form of compensation that can hinder the functional recovery of reflex training. The fact that it did not occur in this patient after nerve transfer was due to the appropriate timing of treatment as symptoms were evaluated every week during treatment period.It was important to investigate taping strategies to improve the patients' walking ability in order to increase their participation in social activities by prolonging the functional recovery of the triceps sural fascia transfer. However, in this case, since the patient complained of a slight foot drag, it would have been better to conduct the EMG evaluation at the time of selecting the taping strategy in order to evaluate the balance.Fujii et al."}

{"text": "Question: 1,How long will uveitis last? \n ### Answer: It is not easy to predict the duration of uveitis. With appropriate treatment, most uveitic episodes should resolve completely, but there is a possibility for the uveitis to last for years before regression in some patients. Onset and evolution of uveitis are always variable.  History and clinical signs may indicate whether the inflammation is a transient or persistent, and it also depends on etiology and the initial response to treatment. Without known causes, uveitis flares considerably more often than quiescent periods. The long-term prognosis is therefore much less favourable.  Quiescent and reactivated disease will likely have the same distribution of recurrences, and the variable inflammatory process is determined by the interplay of host, pathogen, and environment.  In most patients with ASAS, uveitis will improve within several weeks after commencing treatment. If no improvement is observed after 4- to 6-weeks, the possibility of noninfectious uveitis should be investigated, especially in patients with concurrent neurological diseases. To prevent severe visual complications, Continuous monitoring and, if needed, escalation of treatment,.are mandatory. This includes patient education on self-monitoring of the eyes to enable prompt care-seeking.Fig. 1Timelines for uveitis diagnostic process (adapted from Abernathy et al. )"}

{"text": "Question: 5,How serious is a perforated eardrum? \n ### Answer: A perforated eardrum is a serious condition that may affect hearing and ear function significantly. The ear functions through a series of tubes and canals, which give sound waves directed at the eardrum to the inner ear and relay the sound waves to the auditory nerves which send the signal to the brain. Every part of this chain from the eardrum to the auditory nerve can be damaged. If the eardrum is damaged or can no longer perform its function there may be loss of hearing including physical sensation, discomfort, pressure, pain, discharge, balance problems, vertigo, hearing impairment, speech impairment and tinnitus. The perforation can predispose the patient to middle ear infections and may cause damage to the middle ear receptors. The receptors are sensitive enough to register intracochlear pressures as low as 0.24 \u03bcPa (240 nPa). The patient can experience noise induced hearing loss even with short-term exposure to higher levels of noise. The patient with a perforated eardrum may not be able to sense pressure change in the middle ear and may require a tympanic pressure equalizing (TEP) tube. The patient with a tympanic membrane perforation can also develop exposure to damaging noise levels not normally perceived by their hearing. The pressure equalizing tubes may allow more sound levels into the cochlea than normal."}

Family member -CQ3.1 0Because a Staph infection could be serious, why are you only prescribing oral medicine to treat it? -CQ3.2 0I\u2019ve had MRSA 2x earlier, both times I received a prescription for antibiotics to treat the infection I was still infected. I would like to know WHY I am being given antibiotic pills instead of IV antibiotics? -CQ3.6 0I have had several bacterial infections that led to treatments with antibiotics. My understanding of antimicrobials is that they should be targeted to the appropriate bacteria. There is an issue with a widespread non-judicious use of antibiotics that puts others at risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria. It would seem that the symptoms for which I am being treated could be addressed with an alternative, non-antibiotic therapy and I would prefer not to be exposed to these side effects and to reduce the risk of developing resistant bacteria. -CQ3.7 0Serious side effects? \u2014 Oral antibiotics? How is that even possible? I thought oral antibiotics were harmless but just less effective. I am concerned with the emergence of resistant bacteria. They are appearing across this country and it is solely because of the overuse of antibiotics for viral infections especially upper respiratory tract infections. I urge you to reconsider your decision to use antibiotics for these infections unless you have already tried OTC meds and pain in the rear remained.

{"text": "Question: 3,How serious is a whitlow? \n ### Answer: Please understand that the current risk of loss of limb is very low. That is a very rare situation occurring in an unstable or infected patient. However, persistent drainage and antibiotics make limb loss a much higher risk because they delay the healing process. Delayed healing is more likely to develop into an osteomyelitis. Ulcers tend to reoccur frequently in patients so they can be challenging to heal. The infection may persist and infiltrate the tissue over time - the severity of infection depends on the ability of the bacteria to invade tissue in relation to its location and characteristics, environment within the tissue, and immune response."}

{"text": "Question: 7,How serious is an aneurysm on the brain? \n ### Answer: Depends on size and location. For instance, a middle cerebral artery aneurysm is typically nonemergent unless it is very large (ie, >2 cm), but if it was in the posterior circulation, an unruptured aneurysm could be more susceptible to rupture. 8,Does the funnel make the aneurysm dangerous? The pathognomonic feature of an aneurysm is the progressive formation of a broad, straighter vascular segment just proximal to the location of the hemodynamically driven narrowing. The narrow segment is termed the \u201cneck\u201d of the aneurysm. Hemodynamic effect accelerates blood flow causing turbulence and consequent endothelial and smooth muscle cell injury. This, in addition to medical comorbidities such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and genetic factors can lead to a weakening of the vessel wall. The risk of rupture is low when the dome-to-neck ratio is low. The dome-to-neck ratio (% under bifurcation) is a predictor of rupture tendency, and it, along with the diameter of the parent artery, are the most important aneurysm characteristics in determining rupture risk of unruptured intracranial aneurysm."}

Pulmonary hypertension due to decreased oxygen levels can be 1 of the end results of pulmonary hypertension. However, if treated in time, the lung can enlarge to increase its capacity for Scrb oxygen. The degree of pulmonary hypertension varies. If it\u2019s quite serious, it can even cause fever and cough. The clinical signs are exertional dyspnea and a slight cough. Arterial blood gas test may reveal a partial pressure Of O2. Additionally, there may be fluid retention. But it\u2019s difficult to detect this disease in the initial stage, and a lot of patients remain in an undiagnosed state until getting sicker.7. Please give me some examples of vessels which can be involved in pulmonary arterial hypertension. There are many factors that can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension. Some causes consist of the following: 1) Patients with left heart valve disease, the pulmonary circulation becomes overload during diastole and could lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension over time. In fact, such patients also have pulmonary edema, but their lung performance is maintained.2) In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, when oxygen is inhaled through the nose, it will preferentially distribute to the area with less resistance. Nevertheless, inhaling oxygen through the mouth directly enters the trachea and the bronchi, forcing the gas to uniformly distribute to each part of the lung, resulting in vasoconstriction of the pulmonary artery and eventually pulmonary arterial hypertension.3) Patients with permanent right ventricular failure, can become congested and swelling, causing pulmonary arterial hypertension.4) Pulmonary arterial hypertension with no obvious etiology is also called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The deceased of pulmonary blood vessels is the basic factor. Most patients show secondary pulmonary hypertension. Sometimes the pulmonary circulation will cause more damage. 8.

{"text": "Question: 7,Is a dental abscess an emergency? \n ### Answer: An acute dental abscess is an emergency which involves a collection of purulent fluid in the tissues surrounding a tooth. It can develop inside the tooth from a collapsed tooth (pulp). If not treated, an abscess can expand and create a pus-filled infection in the root canal or disperse to other parts of the body. Antibiotics will not remove the infection; the abscess must be drained through operation and tooth is removed. If it is not drained through operation, the infection may cause some other serious complications such as swelling of the jaw and face, cellulitis, localized or disseminated abscess formation, osteomyelitis or sepsis, in rare instances."}

{"text": "Question: 2,Is BDD a disease? \n ### Answer: The authors note that biological basis for the neurobiological hypothesis is a disruption across multiple brain areas, with the volume of these areas negatively correlated with ARQ scores, which is worth reporting; however, a note about the orthogonality of neurobiological research to clinical phenomenology is worth emphasizing. This interval between the phenomenology, as well as SNP variants, in BDD is an opportunity to examine within-research literature, between psychiatric disease states, and the types of disruptions across each, including insights capable of discovering new biological markers, linking genetic and behavioral findings/biomarkers together, and cross-referencing literature. It is typical to see several papers across similar fields referencing each other, such as from epidemiology, diagnosis, and genetic families in common, but it is also common for insufficient direct discussion between the findings across the fields. It seems there is an opportunity to remedy this knowledge gap in the literature with regard to BDD."}

{"text": "Question: 7,Is being a hoarder a mental illness? \n ### Answer: Hoarding is a word describing a problematic pattern of collecting and acquiring things, but not seeing value in these things. Behavior that might be hoarding is difficult to treat. Affected people can seemingly live with the things to have collected. Sometimes, the horde can occupy most of the available space in the home and have an impact on daily life. Hoarding usually goes together with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and depression/anxiety. The different variants are mentioned in the DSM as a part of the Impulse Control Disorders and are described in the Further Reading . Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or repetitive thoughts, which are accompanied by uncomfortable or distressing emotions, sensations, or images that cause anxiety, and/or by repeating rituals, or compulsions. When the impulse control disorders include behavior that causes clear distress, reduces health, or interferes with one\u2019s work, we call the behavior pathological. If the obsessive thoughts or compulsive rituals were comforting to the person, we call them compulsive or pathological only when they cause a functional impairment. In addition, to be categorized as \u2018disorder\u2019 and \u2018impairment\u2019, specificity criteria must be met. For example, for Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Disorder, there must be more than just excessive preoccupation with hygiene without clinically significant impairment or distress is necessary for the diagnosis. There is lack of knowledge regarding severity levels, prevalence, risk, and protective factors for hoarding. Further studies are important and necessary for public health purposes, as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and hoarding often are long-lasting and severely disabling conditions."}

{"text": "Question: 9,Is brain cancer and brain tumor the same? \n ### Answer: No brain cancer and brain tumor are not the same. Brain cancer refers to monganoglioma and glioblastoma multiforme. This cancer develops from the glial cells or nerve cells in the brain. It is also called glioma. Brain tumor refers to all types of tumor that occur in brain whether it\u2019s cancerous or not. It can also refer to cancer that occurs in the brain but not originated in brain cells. 10,What is the prime cause of brain cancer development?The prime cause of brain cancer development is not known. But certain conditions such as exposure to ionizing radiation at a younger age, family history of brain cancer and other cancers, smoking tobacco, certain types of viruses and bacteria increase the risk of developing brain cancer. 11,Can brain cancer be prevented?Although the exact cause of brain cancer is not known, certain factors may help prevent this cancer. These include avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation at a young age, avoiding second-hand smoke and tobacco smoke, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy body weight. 12,What is the life expectancy of a person suffering from brain cancer? The life expectancy depends on a number of factors, such as the stage of cancer, type of brain cancer, and how quickly it spreads. Brain cancer is generally difficult to detect and to diagnose early and this cancer spreads quickly. If the cancer is diagnosed early and is localized, the life expectancy can be up to 5 years. However, it often goes beyond 4 years. 13,What is the most effective treatment for brain cancer?The most effective treatment for brain cancer will depend on the stage and type of brain cancer, and the extent to which cancer cells have spread in the brain. Surgery to remove the tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are common methods used to treat brain cancer. 14,Is there any vaccine for brain cancer?No, there is currently is no available vaccine for brain cancer. However, there are some vaccines undergoing clinical trials for brain cancer.

While the cancer is confined to the cells that cover the surface of the sinus cells, also cancer of the sinus is curable. However, such a cancer is seldom present at the time of discovery. Living cysts in the human body may remain for several decades before the signs or symptoms appear. A growing cyst can be internal pressure on the tissue, producing small holes or erosions on the surface of the surrounding bone or skin. The cyst in the paranasal sinuses is not easy to discover and is usually treated after the appearance of serious pain or accident, such as falling episode, to reveal symptoms. When cancer has spread and cannot be easily removed, it is incurable."}
{"text": "Question: 13,Is carcinoid syndrome a neuroendocrine tumor? \n ### Answer: Answer: Carcinoid syndrome is an adverse effect of neuroendocrine tumors and consists of a group of symptoms related to vasoactive intestinal peptide or serotonin released by neuroendocrine cells.Neuroendocrine cells are present in many organs throughout the body.During digestion, the release of neuroendocrine peptides from a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) can cause the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.Chromogranin-A and neuroendocrine cell-specific enzymes (neuron-specific enzyme) in the blood and urine have a high diagnostic value for NET.Chromogranins are heterogenous chaperone proteins without enzymatic activity, present in secretory vesicles, which participate in both the packaging and release of amines and other substances . They can be considered as an intermediate stage between progranules and mature secretory granules .In humans, six chromogranins from two subclasses have been described: Chromogranins A, B and C (CgA from the C, B, A subclasses) and four granins (PrRP, Page-R, GRP and SCG, in the inactive granin subclass) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/chromogranins).In adult healthy subjects, CgA concentration in serum or plasma is low but concentration in urine is up to 2\u2032000 times higher than in plasma .CgA precursor, proCgA (gene: CHGA), is an immature protein synthesized from negative EC cells in the pancreatic islets and gastrointestinal tract .Its precursor (proCgA precursor) is encoded by the chromogranin gene (CHGA locus). It acts in conjunction with POMC in prohormone processing and storage [14, 37, 38]."}
{"text": "Question: 14,Is carcinoid the same as NET? \n ### Answer: The terms NEN, NET, NEC, and carcinoid can be confusing or challenging, because NENs include both NETs and NECs ((Melehani 2011); (Otag & Phillips 2013); (Stadil 2013); (Hohua & Low 2012); (Steuer 2007); (Wellsteiner et al. 2012)). NE indicates that the tumor cells emerged from neuroendocrine cells (neuroendocrine origin).

{"text": "Question: 24,Is choriocarcinoma a gestational trophoblastic disease? \n ### Answer: Answer: YesSolution 24: \"Trophoblastic cellular differentiation recapitulates that of the gastrula. There are at least four lines of evidence supporting the presence of 'gastrulation\u2010type' differentiation in choriocarcinoma: (1) choriocarcinoma cells express high levels of growth factor receptors (i.e. FGFR\u20102, EGFR, RAF1), cranial neural crest markers (i.e. contactin), axon guidance molecules (i.e. R\u2010cof), genes involved in embryonic stem cell pluripotency (i.e. TERT, SOX2, ESOX1, POU5F1), neural stem cells (i.e. NESTIN), epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers (ZEB\u20102), and Wnt pathway imprint genes (i.e.'SMAD\u20104, serpin 2D and Red\u2010yp) 216. (2) Choriocarcinoma cells also synthesize important cranial neural crest cell primordial growth factors (CEM1, N\u2010myc), as well as neural stem cell genes (i.e. NMR, BMP\u20107, SRY, NRW1) 217, 218. (3) There has been increased evidence of paedomorphosis, stem cell pluripotency associated gene expression, and alpha\u2010fetoprotein (AFP) expression in human choriocarcinoma, as well as the risk of recurrence 219, 220. (4) Increased hypomethylation of retroplacental choriocarcinoma is associated with chromosomal instability and loss of genomic imprinting 221, 222. All these factors together facilitate the review of choriocarcinoma as a gestational trophoblastic disease separate from the cancer collective group\" 21."}

{"text": "Question: 30,Is Clostridium difficile serious? \n ### Answer: Clostridium difficile is not generally thought of as a particularly serious pathogen. However, C. difficile infections (C. difficile) can actually be somewhat serious 31. It is not considered life-threatening, but people infected with C. difficile were significantly more likely to be readmitted to hospital after initially being treated as an outpatient. In one study, 14% of those patients were readmitted due to complications from their C. difficile infection 9. Because C. difficile is not usually recognized as an issue for people it can affect, the amount of research dedicated to the prevention of C. difficile infections is limited. However, if C. difficile was seen as more of a problem, perhaps through a vaccine, then more research would be dedicated to preventing it.On the other hand, people are aware of many respiratory and gastrointestinal infections (e.g., influenza, rotavirus), but even in these cases, C. difficile can go under the radar. In a recent study, the authors asked people to list diseases ranked from least deadly to deadliest and ranked morbidity from low to high. Over half of the 500 people in the study did not list C. difficile anywhere 10. This shows the need to raise awareness about C. difficile, as many people have never heard of it although it is an actual problem.An important thing to realize is that, although a vaccine for any infectious disease is always a worthwhile goal, it is especially true for C. difficile. With antibiotic resistance being a serious problem in a number of bacterial infections, vaccines are particularly desirable. Antibiotic resistance has been found in a growing number of organisms, including a select number of C. difficile strains. C. difficile is interesting in that, although it can cause disease and knowing when to use antibiotics is a vital issue for the treatment of C. difficile infections, the fact that it is usually a side effect of the use of broad spectrum antibiotics makes invasive disease with C. difficile caused by a resistant strain slightly less dangerous. Moreover, there will be time for antibiotics to take effect before C. difficile can kill patients, making a vaccine to prevent the development of C. diffic"}

{"text": "Question: 42,Is Cushing syndrome curable? \n ### Answer: Yes, reversibility of Cushing syndrome depends on the underlying etiology. Most forms of Cushing syndrome (tumor-caused) are treatable and potentially curable with early diagnosis. We have illustrated this algorithm for the diagnosis and management of Cushing syndrome in Figure 1. Surgery to remove the source of the Cushing syndrome is the most direct treatment of hypercortisolism and most of the cases can be cured with surgery. If surgery cannot be performed or is not effective, there are other treatment options available such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or pharmacotherapy. Resistance to treatment can result in the tumor recurring up to 20 years later. For patients with Cushing disease, the risk of repeated tumor development after irradiation remains a concern. Many transsphenoidal surgery cases in which the tumor has been completely resected and the hypophysis selectively irradiated have still relapsed and that supports the argument for radiation. 19 However, Corticotroph pituitary adenyocarcinomas are more frequent recurrence than craniopharyngeal carcinoma and melanoma related pituitary dormancy."}

However, many patients with cyclothymic personality type and bipolar affective disorder have significant periods of depression and thus, they could be categorized as having treatment-resistant depression. However, often in bipolar patients, depression is less responsive to treatment than the elevated mood. This may begin in the very early stages of the illness. Similarly, cyclothymic temperament could progress later to bipolar affective disorder with depressive features (especially in those patients with significant psychotic features).28No; depression is usually sub-syndromal in this group, but they may present manic symptoms more markedly than depressive symptoms.

{"text": "Question: 54,Is Diabetes Type 2 serious? \n ### Answer: Diabetes type 2 results from insulin resistance. Over 90% of diabetes cases are type 2. Positive family history of diabetes or obesity is a risk factor for the disease. It can cause eye damage, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, and nerve damage. Early detection and treatments will effectively prevent complications. The control of blood glucose level is the key issue in diabetes management. We control diabetes through medications, diet, exercise, and psychological measures. The patient also needs special education on self-care and regular health examinations. It is currently the best way to detect eye damage and other complications. As the disease progresses, we may minimize exercise and tighten the control of blood glucose."}

{"text": "Question: 61,Is dyslexia a disorder or a disability? \n ### Answer: Considering the strong viewpoints of individuals on either side, probably the only answer is that it is both and neither; however, it is clear that both are ripe for change.On one hand classical definitions of disability undoubtedly describe people with dyslexia. On the other hand, by virtue of stereotyped negative views of cognitive vulnerability the word dyslexia has long been attached to a range of notions of deficiency and inadequacy, despite numerous research-supported arguments against this position.The balance of views and opinions will shift, in part, by educational and cultural policies that define whether or not people positively afforded with diversity of thinking, can excel and make real meaningful contributions to society.The gene marker, DCDC2, has been linked to a greater likelihood to develop dyslexia if ~500 bp-long sequences are removed. The role of individual variability in the \u2018epigenetics\u2019 (coined epinome), and how this impacts the brain, is still at the beginning of path to understanding how to best serve the needs of individuals of all abilities, and when it best happens to do so.Few adults gain access to measures of their strengths and vulnerabilities, and countenance the results in contrast to their perceived needs and aspirations. Accessible tools for continuous, self-directed skill development is nascent, epitomised by the worldwide, weekly cryptocurrency App investment group (a related form of \u2018spiralling-upward learning\u2019). Highly educated, high conceptual ability enhancement for spelling skills is also in need of optimization.The single most important issue for the wellbeing of children and families struggling with the challenge to constructively accommodate and optimally navigate the signs and symptoms of neurodiversity across the lifespan is changing culture, so the fullest interests of children are nurtured and achieve their full potential.Table 2Fundamental topics of controversy (adapted from )a.

{"text": "Question: 62,Is dyslexia a form of autism? \n ### Answer: As discussed in \u201cIs dyslexia an impairment of general cognitive ability?\u201d, this is a question that may interest neuropsychologists but is of limited relevance in clinical practice or educational settings. The logic behind the autism-dyslexia link is that some studies show some people with dyslexia to have difficulty with social interactions. However, these findings do not hold up (e.g., ). Furthermore, even strong deficits on autism measures in people with dyslexia cannot be considered an impairment, because autism\u2019s defining characteristics, deficits in social skills, and impairments in communication, have not been documented."}

His mother indicated to the assessor that he had issues with coordinating visual and hemi-spatial information, where for example he tops up cups in the kitchen, so that they are always level. There was an impression of relative right hemisphere weakness, which is not uncommon in children (or adults) who are dyspraxic due to DCD.

In a study, using a targeted sequenced panel, it was found that 64% of the MEG3 gene mutations are associated with primary immune deficiency disease (53O). However, it is not yet known whether MEG3 gene mutations cause autoimmune disease. However, MEG3 gene splicing is associated with autoimmune diseases, and the disease itself affects the splicing of this gene (52E). In another study, different types of immune cells were associated with different phenotypes of autoimmune disease, so focusing on the genetic profile of each type of immune cells can be useful in knowing more about autoimmune disease (53U)."}

Viral geneticists have discovered several unique features of SARS-CoV-2 that may be playing a physiological role in the transmission of this virus, the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease, and possibly the course of COVID-19. As people learn more about these genes, they have new questions regarding their influence on the inter-individual clinical variability. A unique discussion thread among healthcare workers, the frontline fighters of the COVID-19 war, has been the self-reported \u201cocular symptomatology\u201d of the infection as they work to keep themselves and their patients healthy. We already know that the SARS-CoV-2 virus invades human cells by binding with the ACE2 receptors on the host cells.[4\u20136] Several studies have reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears of COVID-19 patients and the virus tends to persist in tears of COVID-19 patients who are sicker."}

{"text": "Question: 18,Is hypothyroidism and underactive thyroid the same? \n ### Answer: Underactive means that the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormones, while hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder caused by a lack of thyroid hormones. Both hypothyroidism and underactive thyroid refer to the same condition in which thyroid hormone production is inadequate. The lack of thyroid hormones in hypothyroidism is usually caused by an autoimmune disorder (Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis) or removal of the thyroid gland (total or partial thyroidectomy) (Vingtdeux, 2010). As a result, the interchangeable use of the two terms is considered acceptable. A couple of reasons contributed to underactive thyroid being less frequently used than hypothyroidism. Firstly, thyroid hormones are formed, stored, and released into the bloodstream by the thyroid gland. Therefore, the thyroid gland\u2019s levels and functions should return to default or normal levels when the gland is healthy again. In contrast, using the term \u201cunderactive thyroid\u201d implies that the thyroid gland\u2019s normal function has been lost permanently (Kvedaras et al., 2018). Secondly, hypothyroidism is generally considered to be a long-term illness, and PPT is usually transient. Furthermore, because hypothyroidism is prevalent in senior patients, it is frequently assumed to be a sign of ageing. For all these reasons, both terms have the same definition, and they can be used interchangeably (Kvedaras et al., 2018)."}

{"text": "Question: 21,Is interstitial cystitis serious? \n ### Answer: Interstitial cystitis should be considered a disabling disease. Symptoms vary from person to person and on different occasions for each person. For some it is a mild inconvenience for others chronic bladder pain can confine them to bed for days at a time, others struggle in pain on a daily basis with symptoms of a constantly feeling of urinary urgency, urination occurring both day and night, which in turn may result in loss of sleep and in some decrease work or social life. Findings of many reports indicate that despite different treatments a significant number of patients show no change, while for others symptoms seem to improve only to fluctuate or rise again thereafter. In view of the lack of controlled studies and consensus as to the nature and degree of classification of severity of interstitial cystitis, despite the apparent high frequency of the illness a common agreement about the current and a future therapeutic plan is difficult. There needs to be more understanding and acceptance among physicians in different fields and attention to the clinical signs of pain and discomfort in order that sufferers are not dismissed as having 'constitutional symptoms, psychological difficulties, stressful life events, or other biopsychological problems'. The expert committee agreed that treatment of interstitial cystitis involves long-term management of a potentially chronic disease. Good management requires regular follow-up examinations and adjustment of the treatment plan. Most interstitial cystitis sufferers will require treatment for life, although remission for variable periods is possible, even with conservative treatment. 18"}

However, when irritability becomes persistent and interferes with daily life, it may be a sign of an underlying mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. It can also be a symptom of certain physical health conditions, such as sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or anemia. If you are experiencing persistent irritability, it is important to talk to a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to determine the best course of treatment."}

{"text": "Question: 58,Is low sex drive okay? \n ### Answer: 10PositiveHaving a good sex life is important, but this can mean lots of different things on the sexual spectrum. Just being affectionate and wanting to be close to, and be close to, your partner can be some people\u2019s idea of a good sex life. Low sex drive can be normal, including for trans men whose bodies may no longer feel comfortable giving or receiving certain types of physical intimacy. As long as you\u2019re happy with the frequency and type of physical intimacy and sexual contact you\u2019re having, and you don\u2019t feel you should be \u201cperforming\u201d because of assumptions others may hold, then having lower sex drive is okay.75YesUse appropriate sexual aids?3PositiveIt is important to remember that sexual aids shouldn\u2019t be used as crutches (although meeting needs they serve is important) and we should remove the presumption that their use is part of social sex expectations and norms. There are so many hurdles entry into sexual relationships as TGNC people, it is counter-productive to set up \u201cnot having the right equipment\u201d as an obstacle. At the same time, it is also important to point out that appropriate sexual aids exist and should be available to those who want them.77YesAre there evidenced-based treatments or interventions for TGNC people who are experiencing sexual health challenges?10PositiveYes. Evidence based biases, prejudices and microaggressions within healthcare systems (e.g. obstructive and disempowering gatekeeping; unequal access and services; hyper-vigilant approach to sexual suspicions) are central to the challenges people experience with gaining access, participation and preparing for medical/anatomical changes during transition and thus to their sexual health. Evidence-based controls and interventions of a psychological nature are likely to be more effective outside of this context.78YesIs it important to be comfortably \u201cnaked\u201d (unclothed) with your sexual partner(s)?11PositiveYes, being comfortable enough with themselves and their bodies to be comfortable to take part in naked play, nude swimming etc.seems to be important. For some people, participation in macrophilia is important. Many people, including trans people, feel more vulnerable when undressing, especially if they have been made to feel vulnerable and unsafe elsewhere.

{"text": "Question: 60,Is Lyme disease fatal in humans? \n ### Answer: 843Short answer is no, if it is diagnosed and treated early. If left untreated, it can result in a disabling arthritis and neurologic disorders.924How is Lyme disease diagnosed?848There are no accurate tests to diagnose early Lyme disease. The diagnostic tests vary depending on the stage of the disease. The \u201cclassic\u201d EM rash can be diagnosed by history alone, and there are blood antibody tests available to diagnose late disease. The most controversial aspect in the diagnosis of Lyme disease today relates to the use of antibody tests to diagnose patients >2 weeks from the onset of acute symptoms. Some patient groups recommend the use of these antibody tests for acute US patients if used as an adjunctive test for diagnosis, not for the diagnosis itself. The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS), the Modern N D league, and the American National Academy of Medicine (IOM) have recommended that the stores should not be diagnosed with \u201cELISA test\u201d. The use of antibodies is controversial in some areas of the United States. It is likely to be welcomed in the United States, but the consensus of European experts (NOT THE EFNS) is that the antibody test \u201cmay\u201d be useful if the test is \u201cnegative.\u201d 889How is Lyme disease treated?836Late localized Lyme disease can also be treated clinically with 2 or 3 weeks of oral antibiotics. The most common choices around are doxycycline or cefuroxime axetil. An argument is derived after the study that favors cefaloxin on the Supreme 7th edition of the Infectious Disease. Note that clarification for the short duration report for the people who have no symptoms is already 5-10 days of antibiotics, and possible benefit of long program is not proven directly.870To what extent should ND be guided by antibody test results?848Even though ND cannot be diagnosed with only serologic test, antibody tests are helpful in making the diagnosis.1011 What causes Lyme disease-like symptoms?854It is not always possible to differentiate between patients with acute Lyme disease and patients with another illness with the same sign and thysigm.

For many years, measles was thought to be the most deadly of the mosquito-borne diseases. But now there is a vaccination for measles. In Africa, about 150,000 people die of measles each year, far below the millions who die of malaria 78,80,What diseases (in addition to malaria) can be caused by mosquitoes?Malaria is not the only disease that is transmitted through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquitoes that feed mainly in the hours before dawn as well as in the early night. These mosquitoes can also transmit other diseases such as \u201cyellow fever, filariasis, dengue, West Nile virus, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Zika virus, Eastern equine encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis\u201d.(This is for an advanced learner or an adult learner.)Answers63,Can mosquitoes be harmful without biting?Certain species of mosquitoes can harm humans without actually biting.

{"text": "Question: 63,Is Marfan syndrome rare? \n ### Answer: No, although studies indicate that the prevalence is more than 1:5000 . Marfan syndrome is common among people with Caucasian descent , and MFS can be inherited, either from the mother or the father in a dominant fashion . Marfan syndrome is a multi-diagnostic classification with a predominantly structural character , caused by null or missense mutations in the genes coding fibrillin , , e.g. fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and fibrillin-2 (FBN2) . The zero allele theory applied to fibrillinogen is of the most utility in Marfan syndrome regarding small mutations, and several fibrillin mutations of interest have been defined . The accumulation of fibrillin in different organs depends on where the mutation comes from, and the cell/tissue may respond differently depending on whether the mutation is \u201cfibrillin-related\u201d or not related  Exactly how blending gene mutation to environmental factors may lead to the final outcome in the clinic within a certain biological cascade or pathway remains an academic question , i.e. alterations in certain cell structures or receptor functions . There are blood biomarkers and clinical biomarkers (increased heart rate due to dehydration, etc) . Previously, there were no specific biomarkers for the diagnosis of MFS. The first defined degradation products for fibrillin-1 will probably be useful for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome , which can be considered rare, or rather underdiagnosed."}

As the term suggests, molluscum contagiosum is contagious. However, it is not considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, but rather a skin infection. It is most commonly caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), specifically types 1 and 4. These types of HPV are highly contagious and can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact. While molluscum contagiosum is more commonly seen in young children, it can also affect adults. However, in adults, it is often associated with an underlying immune deficiency or history of HPV infection. If not treated, it can last for months or years. It appears as small, flesh-colored bumps with a halo of skin around the base. While some cases resolve spontaneously, there are several topical and systemic treatments that can be used as an anti-molluscum agent.

{"text": "Question: 25,Is polymorphous light eruption autoimmune? \n ### Answer: A case report of 6 separate patients observed the typical pathological features of polymorphous light eruption by laser capture microdissection from skin biopsies in patients with a clinical history of polymorphous light eruption. This study revealed a more extensive dataset of proteins with altered location than previous microarray-based studies (1). Previous work from one group implicates C5, C4, and both interferon-\u03b3 and interferon-\u03b3-induced protein 10 (IP-10) in the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption suggesting an interferon-\u03b3-mediated process (2). Other work, on the other hand, appears to refute this finding by demonstrating that the disease may be a consequence of an autoimmune pathogenetic mechanism possibly mediated via anti-desmoglein1 antibodies (3). Unique glycoproteins potentially expressed in polymorphous light eruption have also been described (4) and increased release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin was identified in a novel mouse model of polymorphous light eruption (5). Further investigation is still needed to delineate the mechanisms operating in these individuals, but it is clear that polymorphous light eruption belongs to a spectrum of autoimmune diseases all driven by exposure to solar UV radiation."}

Reactive arthritis is a form of arthritis that occurs in response to an infection. It is also known as Reiter's syndrome. It usually affects the large joints of the body, such as the knees and ankles. It can also affect the small joints of the fingers and toes. The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually last for a few weeks or months, and they may include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. It is important to note that reactive arthritis is not the same as rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the joints and other organs of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by an overactive immune system that attacks the joints and causes inflammation. It is a long-term condition that usually lasts for many years, and it may cause joint damage if it is not treated."}

Leptospirosis may also cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous changes, renal, cardiac, ocular or neuropathologic involvement ( although most of them are mild or moderate, and usually resolve without the need for additional treatment ) The case manifestations leads to the definitive diagnosis and admission to the hospital. Weil\u2019s disease is clinically characterized by the sudden onset of non-specific symptoms, among which are headaches, back pains, muscle weakness, paresthesias, high fever, chills or sudden flu accompanied with jaundice and increased hepatic enzymes ( AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase) in their blood tests. Maestro et.al reported the radiographic hallmarks of Weil\u00b4s disease which is bilateral edema of the pancreas TU , and these features are the same in other studies , . Some cases, there will be another appearance of water in bile ducts in CT scan . John et al. reported that the mendelian recessive, autosomal recessive and x-linked inheritance of Weil's disease could be composed with homozygous mutations of proline residue no. 554 (P554) within the ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B (NDUFB6) coding region, which is inherited from both immune-related genes .

I think they are pulling an \"evergreen\" be it inadvertently or purposely.

{"text": "Question: 46,What are nightmares trying to tell you? \n ### Answer: For one person, the content, setting, and emotional context of their dream serves as a reminder of a particular memory or experience, from which they may intimate greater meaning. They literally dream it up. For others, nightmare content may reflect their hidden thoughts, desires, and worries. This deep inner knowledge runs completely counter to the ego, which often tries to curtail such personal self-examination. The dream is drawing attention to a psychological issue to be resolved or to connectedness with others for others, with whom they need to improve their relationships. But if they bury their heads in the sand, how can they transform this problem content into something productive? For example, to deal with a boss\u2019s antagonism toward her, it was necessary to acknowledge the hostility, work through the real and imagined rejection, and gain a new perspective."}

{"text": "Question: 49,What are pressures sores? \n ### Answer: (the information should be comprehensive, but not too long. Only main information is needed ) Pressure ulcers are areas of local damage to the skin and/or tissue, which occur as a result of pressure in combination with friction and shear. The pressure causes restriction of blood flow to the tissue and reduces a tissue\u2019s capacity to heal. Friction is the shear load between two surfaces. A moist environment and reduced mobility are contributing risk factors. People who experience constant pressure and friction pressures created by gravity are at risk for developing pressure ulcers. Moisture and shear force will also aggravate the development and persistence of a pressure ulcer. . Ideally, turning and repositioning patients and good nursing care can prevent ulcers, but good nutrition and infection management is also important. Moreover , a clear definition of the pressure stress is fundamental; the uniform load and non-uniform load in the human body are of different Pi\u00e8rrea. It is very difficult to mark out a load on the human body by several points, such as ten or a larger number. The corresponding places of different pressure-matrices generated by the human body do not reach the same value by using the same measurement opportunity . 50,What are peirieres? Are peiriers are same as pressure sore? Peiersrea are inevitable when the human body is under constant pressure. They are not the same as pressure soresa, but rather a warning sign for the development of pressure ulcers . Pressure ulcers are called peiersres by some people"}

These include osteoporosis, bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta, etc.Non-Pathological: These occur in previously healthy individuals without predisposing factors and are due to high-energy (low-velocity accidents, sports, falls, etc.) or low-energy (trip/slip, standing or sitting from a height, drop object, etc.) Impactors, with variations in length of fracture, pain and displacement.Low-Energy FracturesLow-energy fractures can occur as pathological or non-pathological depending upon the underlying disease. 10Assaults: Fractures occurring as a result of direct violence towards the individual, this could be from an altercation and blunt force trauma, or as a result of weapon or object use. 5Tumors: Bone lesions or tumors are not inherently associated with a fracture; however, depending on the type of tumor, it may lead to a fracture from a weakness in the bone. 4Taking away pillars and pressing on bones and jointsFractures can also occur because of advanced age and decreased bone density. Such fractures are known as \u201cstress fractures\u201d: their underlying mechanism is the accumulation of"}

{"text": "Question: 03,What are the 3 stages of MND? \n ### Answer: 54,1051. There are 3 different stages of MND: the early, middle, and late stage. These stages are all measured by time since onset of symptoms.2. Progression of MND is unknown but it seems to be slowest during the early stage. Patients with MND may not become more disabled if they receive early and aggressive treatment6. The middle stage is marked by a moderate loss of muscle strength and weight. It may last several years and there is no general agreement as to what treatments should be used at this stage.7. During the late stage, patients with ALS may suffer from diffuse muscle weakness, breathing problems, and severe weight loss. ALS patients usually lose the ability to speak and swallow and many eventually end up in a \u201cdeep coma.\u201d8. It is common that patients continue to function quite well for months or even years after diagnosis. At times it may be difficult to determine the stage9. Initial diagnoses are often low to moderate numbers of CD4 lymphocytes and an elevated CSF protein level.10. Most patients who have been diagnosed with lower ALS, moderate ALS, or even severe ALS may carry on for several years. Identification of a patient\u2019s cognitive ability does not fall within the scope of usual clinical examination. Therefore, the cogwheel rigidity element of the MND cognitive system examination rarely receives attention, although it is a feature of known frontotemporal dementia (FTLD). When patients die of ALS, upon examination of the lower motor neurons, the majority are found and it is rare for any patient without lower motor neuron degeneration to be identified11. Most cases of MND occur sporadically. The wheelchair stage represents the end of the disease in the typical case, but the length of the pre-wheelchair stages has too much variability to accurately describe as an average12. The medically defined life expectancy from the onset of paralysis to death is 3-5 years, the vast majority dying within 10 years and very rarely for 20 years or more"}
{"text": "Question: 04,What are the 3 stages of septic shock? \n ### Answer: Explain about them.1. Mild to moderate initial insult inflammatory phase: during this phase, a person with severe burn is able to maintain an adequate cardiac output. This phase initially lasts 1-3 hours or at most by 15 hours following a severe burn, and within 48 hours following the trauma, the endothelial damage is initiated. Initial endothelial cell damage releases cytokines and activation of acute phase reactants 2; cytokine release syndrome: systemic inflammatory response syndrome is more prominent in this phase and gradually initiates the second phase within 1-3 hours persistent insult. 3. Hypercoagulable phase: the secondary hypercoagulable phase may be activated by either hepatic cell necrosis, mild to moderate sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (15%) or major burns (15%). This phase may also be activated by large vessel necrosis or thrombotic occlusion in large blood vessels, either during the initial phase or secondary phase injury; localized production of thrombin, leading to small vessel thrombi formation and serum fibrinogen depletion; may result in severe bleeding complications and renal tubular necrosis. Patients entering into hypercoagulable phase within 2-24 hours early. Renal failure may continue. Inflammatory response resultsin cardiac failure 9abcdef.3. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is more prominent in this phase and gradually initiates the second phase within 1-3 hours persistent insult. 4.

{"text": "Question: 09,What are the 3 types of achalasia? \n ### Answer: With the advances in the diagnostic approach, esophageal achalasia is approved to be a heterogeneous disease. Based on the unique manometric features as well as the histopathologic qualities, the classicalphenotype is termed as achalasia with normal LES, achalasia with hypercontractile LES and achalasia with relaxed LES. The ICA is established with the manometric criteria, for example the existence of increased basal pressure and absence of esophageal peristalsis. Therefore, achalasia with normal LES and abnormal LES are distinguished from each other according to the complete absence of peristalsis waves or not. Esophageal achalasia with normal LES is characterized as normal peristalsis, endoscopic abnormalities, peri-esophageal hypo-enhancement and typical nuclear characteristics such as increased acetylcholinesterase activity or infiltration of lymphocytes/lymphoid tissue in histopathology. Esphagitis of the mucous membrane is detected in 25% of patients representing erosions without ulcerations or scarring reactions. Monteast et al. in 70% of patients with achalasia found a significant thickening of collagen fibers in the muscular layer of esophagus.4, Exceptionally, achalasia with lack of contractility is detected with complete absence of peristaltic activity and the tension of lower esophageal sphincter is reduced to half of its normal value.5 Besides (Sud et al.) identified 2 new clinical phenotypes of achalasia: progressive and rapidly severe form of it. According to the initiation time, clinical and endoscopic progress of achalasia, they divided patients to 2 classes. 52% of cases belonged to rapidly evolving type with severe complications including: esophageal dilation, Barrett\u2019s disease, peptic strictures, esophageal fistulas. Although, the rest patients had progressive disease for a mean of 20 months before development of symptoms. In this scenario if there is some sign of dysphagia or Barrett\u2019s esophagus, dilation should be suggested as the first step, then marginal zone incision or potential esophagectomy in"}

According to the Prevention and Treatment Guide for Hospital Pressure Ulcers (2012 edition),carried out by the National Pressure Sore Advisory Panel, National Hospital Immunity Advisory Panel, European Pressure Sore Advisory Panel, Asian Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance, the 5-point scale for the grading of pressure sores is as follows:Stage I: nonblistered, erythematous skin; findings presented by bright red coloration of the skin, which is different from surrounding skin. Both highly suspicious areas and areas of known risk are under observation.Stage II: blistering, broken skin; an area of dermis that is exposed after breaking the skin barrier is covered by an intact or hemorrhagic blood-filled blister.In Stage II, the character of the ulcer is often an intact or Waterman blister over the area of denuded skin. Stage II may be accompanied by the isolated loss of dermis of the pressure ulcer.Stage III: skin covered ulcer that is shallow; the granulation tissue with a yellow coloration often found that does not penetrate deep into the underlying adipose tissue/muscle.Stage IV: a deep ulcer and one with a fracture in the bone or tendon beneath; the shortening of the affected bone, and sometimes the presence of a 10 cm or larger area of necrotic tissue.Stage V: extensively sloughing skin that presents the extensive abscess; exposing adipose tissue, fascia, muscle, tendon, or bone, which is particularly crucial evidence of osteomyelitis or vascular impairment."}

{"text": "Question: 58,What are the 4 main types of developmental disorders? \n ### Answer: 4,5,19,20 and 30The Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in the developmental period of childhood. Autism is diagnosed on the behavioral symptoms of impaired social interactions, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and repetitive behaviors and interests. Its causes are still unclear. The recent discoveries of mutation in genes that express Glutamate Receptor or Shank proteins have produced a better comprehension [Nag, Urasaki, 2012]. As the list of genetic causes of ASD is quite long (see recent review of this topic in ), the correlation between genetic alterations and molecular neuroimaging features is under investigation (see  and reference therein). Therefore, there is a need for proper animal models as genetic alterations seem to lead to diverse pathologies. The genetic animal model for the extensive molecular neuroimaging analysis presented here has a duplication of a genomic segment of approx. 600kb (spanning the genes Shank3, Mecp2, and Neurexin 1, Figure 2.2 in ) which are under investigation for their role in ASDs. In addition, MeCP2 is responsible for Rett syndrome (RTT), which has atypical ASDs features; defects in Mecp2 gene are also discussed in other development disorder like intellectual disorder . The Shank3 gene has been started to be deeply investigated for its role in ASDs and suggested for the development of a new category of the spectrum . Disruption of Shank3 is present in atypical ASDs characterized by severe macrocephaly, as the Angelman syndrome . Moreover, type 1 TSC patients (homozygous for the Tsc1mutation) has disruption in mTOR network and abnormalities in Shank3, MeCP2 [28, 30]. Although there could be other sites of gene alteration we focused on the largest copy-number variations in human genome (Table 2).

These episodes typically include depressive episodes which include periods of depression accompanied by suicidal tendencies, and manic or mixed episodes which include periods of mania accompanied by decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, excessive activity, impulsive and reckless behavior, and irritability.Bipolar I disorder (BP I): repetaed periods of manic episode and inter episodes of depression, and Bipolar II disorder (BP II) - recurrent depressive episodes and multiple manic episodes but it has some differences such as hypomania in bipolar II patients as a light form of manic episode and abnormal cyclothymic mood.Bipolar disorder differs from the normal mood swings that accompany the ups and downs of everyday life, because its symptoms are more severe, persistent, and interfere with daily life.Bipolar disorder can accompanied with anxiety, irritability, labor problems and financial and relationship problems.Who is affected?Manic depressive disorder affects 0.4 percent of the Western populations. Among these, 60 to 80 percent of patients are BPI and the rest are BPII. 10% of the patients with bipolar affective disorder experienced a first episode when they were children or adolescents. These children and adolescents also have different symptomatology, course and response to treatments.

Historically, these were classified both as sarcoidosis, but more recent histopathological classification tend to focus on the tubulonodular type as Sarcoidosis and the fibrotic one puts one in a contrajecture position to classify the disease, therefore, in the phenotype analysis of the ESI (sarcoid group-17 patients) the fibrotic type is regarded as a quest subclinical form.Additionally, the sarcoidosis could present with dissociated stage fibrosis, for example, a nodular lesion on thorax CT could be classified in St. 3 and an abdominal granuloma could be classified in St. 4 or vice versa. Each site has its own stage history.On the one hand, the presence of chronic lung disease, fever is the best predictor for stage 3 sarcoid, while the presence of retrosternal extension and lung scarring is highly predictive for chronic disease more generally. On the other hand, patient in the yearly ICU cations strongly predicts for severe fibrosis."}

Some scholars have proposed many ways to apply palliative care, but there are still few studies on how to better use palliative care for cancer patients with poorer prognosis. The sample data are usually derived from a large amount of statistics, and there is no targeted guidance such as the outcome of the study. Therefore, this study will undertake qualitative methods to address how to deliver palliative care to cancer patients with poorer prognosis? Is there a unified palliative care delivery model, and how can we improve the delivery of palliative care? Therefore, this study uses the method of qualitative research to explore and analyze the content of palliative care delivery for cancer patients with poorer prognosis, as well as the effectiveness of palliative care delivery model.

The typical signs of melanoma are a new bump or nodule on the skin, a change in the size, shape, color, or symptoms of an existing lesion, or a new spot on the skin. Other signs of melanoma include a sore that does not heal, spreading of dark lines (referred to as \u201cstreaks\u201d) within an existing mole, a thickened patch in an existing mole or blemish, bleeding from a birthmark, or change in the shape of birthmarks. \u2212+++0.66 (0.55\u20130.80)Cb32,What is the worst case scenario of melanoma?If untreated, the probability of surviving melanoma is low compared with other types of skin cancer.

{"text": "Question: 35,What are the 6 common nail diseases? \n ### Answer: Individuals mostly consult their physicians during the onset of the signs and symptoms of nail diseases. A brief examination reveals changes in morphology, different examples of discoloration, onycholysis, or even the detachment of nails, or possibly the whole nail plate, that is, trachyonychia and often a predisposing dermatological condition or systemic disease. Nail plate abnormalities are hard to treat. Not only patients with complex dystrophies but also patients with simple nail plate alterations are a challenge by dermatologists, podiatrists, surgeons, physiotherapists, and cosmetic specialists. Dystrophies can be a significant component in psychosocial problems affecting a person\u2019s quality of life. A significant element of caring for patients with nail abnormalities is patient instruction in the possible causes and prognosis of their nail condition. The knowledge and insight provided to patients by their doctors may provide the foundation for stress reduction and enhanced compliance with terminological methods. A lot of the nail and skin therapists are focused on studying novel pharmaceutical agents and new technical methods of treating toenail disorders. Other negligible advances rely on a deeper understanding of the core pathogenetic events associated with the initiation and progression of nail dystrophies. However, further research will be the diagnosis and treatment of congenital nail anomalies."}

{"text": "Question: 37,What are the 6 signs of hypoglycemia? \n ### Answer: Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, low BG, or hypo, and is a common if not the most feared complication for a person living with T1D, occurs when the body does not have enough glucose to function properly. Without steady access to glucose from the bloodstream, the brain becomes starved for energy. This can result in confusion, inattentiveness, and in severe cases unconsciousness or even death.Energy from glucose is essential to all cells, but the brain has a specific need for it to function properly. When glucose levels in the bloodstream drop, brain cells start to use fats stored in the body to remain functional. Although fats are energetic efficient, they cannot be used to produce needed energy in the brain and the brain cannot store glucose for later use. Low blood glucose will impair function in the brain over time, resulting in decreased intellectual capacity . While all brain cells can produce energy from fats, only 20 percent of neurons can survive more than 30 minutes without glucose. Yet even though they cannot operate efficiently, cells can continue to function until available glucose is exhausted. In effect, they enter into a type of coma ."}

I am presuming here that you consider the onset of High blood sugar from the time when the blood sugar level is out of the normal range. This initial audible content would be varied and require the service to orientate the individual listener for any changed in audible content. The service could be affected by whether this step is performed or not (this step, requirement or necessity with the subsequent step is in need of further research efforts for empirical findings).In the following paragraphs, the article indicates that the package is broken into 12 sections. Each section was introduced by a short topic sentence. I consider that the service pathway is not only reflected from audible content aspects, rather this is also true from features aspects.

It may occur as abdominal pain or back pain.Screening tests like CT scan or MRI of the pancreas, abdominal ultrasound and EUS help to diagnose in people who are at risk of pancreatic diseases.74,What are the risk factors for pancreatic neoplasms?The most important known risk factors are smoking and diabetes mellitus. Genetic predisposition has been postulated on the basis of family cancer history and has been confirmed by genetic analysis of the pancreatic cancer-prone families. High alcohol intake is an established risk factor in men, but the potential additive effect to smoking remains to be determined. A number of additional genetic mutations, currently under investigation, have yet to be assessed as risk factors for the development of pancreatic cancer.69,What is the role of drugs in the etiology of PDAC?The only drug clearly linked with the risk of PDAC is reaction with Inhibin alpha (INHA) and Inhibin beta (INHBB) genes of the PAI-1 family.The principal role of INHA is to decrease the circulating and tissue level of inhibin B. The main function of Inhibin B is to inhibit the production of estrogens in female ovaries.

The respondents were required to identify the four stages of DR by choosing from 4 stage descriptions. Diabetics were asked to choose one definition per stage from a total of 4 possible definitions.Respondents were taught about the four stages of Diabetic Retinopathy which include background retinopathy, non-proliferative retinopathy (NPR), proliferative retinopathy (PPR) and advanced diabetic retinopathy. The teaching consisted of a talk by a senior medical doctor for about 10 minutes followed by a question and answer session with the respondents to clear their doubts.Emotional distress such as Fear of the Unknown This theme was identified from responses to questions of respondents in the quantitative study.Concerns were identified about the lack of awareness about the detection of the diabetic eye disease at an earlier stage. On follow-up, after the first interview we realised there seemed to be some misconceptions among the diabetic population about eye screening for diabetic retinopathy.

At low total body iron, nearly all iron is saturated, but when total body iron reaches a high level, most of the transferrin may be saturated with iron. Thus, in iron overload, there is inefficient transport of iron into the cells and tissues.We only incorporated the movement of Iron into cell approach (avoiding Transferrin approach), because we had to keep it simple and easily repeatable. 42,In hemochromatosis, why is the serum ferritin level in HFE mutation homozygoues different from those in the general population? - Manganese and its symptoms Iron stores in the liver, pancreas, and myocardium are usually appreciable even if serum iron and TIBC are not increased. So eventually serum ferritin levels is high. It is used as a handle and a confirmatory test for iron deficiency. 60,49,Circulating blood levels of hepcidin are high in hemochromatosis and low in iron deficiency- what else is high in hemochromatosis? - Manganese and its symptoms In hemochromatosis, the blood levels of hepcidin are high. It causes reduced intestinal iron absorption and inhibits iron release from hepatic stores, so both eventually serve to deplete body iron stores. In iron deficiency, both are low - one low iron stores and other low iron stores will result in low hepcidin levels. 23,70,(Young hepatitis patient) a case of hemochromatosis can be diagnosed by Low total iron binding capacities (TIBC) and High transferrin saturation. - Manganese and its symptoms HFE hemochromatosis Type 1 is the most common genetic disease, it leads to iron"}

{"text": "Question: 40,What are the signs and symptoms of parathyroid disease? \n ### Answer: Please clarify what is meant by \u201cderanged parathyroid hormone levels\u201d. Parathyroid hormone is secreted by the parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels in the blood, and plays a major role in bone and mineralization. Low parathyroid hormone levels are associated with low calcium levels (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia) and may cause muscle cramps, muscle spasms, heart arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, nerve function damage, anxiety, depression, and a higher risk of seizures. Paradoxically, high parathyroid hormone levels may occur in two pathological states: hyperparathyroidism and pseudo-hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder caused by increased parathyroid hormone levels, which leads to increased blood calcium concentration. The most common cause of hyperparathyroidism is the growth of one or more parathyroid tumors. However, 5% of these cases are primary hyperparathyroidism. Symptoms of high blood calcium may include fatigue, weakened muscles, back pain, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation, kidney stones, and heart rhythm problems. Pseudo-hyperparthryroidism is the phase of CaSR nonfunction genetic diseases (CASR NOF). CaSR-NOF is a rare disease that results in parathyroid gland hyperplasia, high levels of parathyroid hormone, and low levels of calcium in the blood. It is characterized by heterozygous inactivation variants in the gene encoding CaSR. The average age of onset is about 4 years. The symptoms of hypercalcemia gradually increase in severity with advancing age. Symptoms and signs of this condition may include DIRES (dehydration, irritability, renal failure, and electrolyte disturbance), rachitic stadium, nephrocalcinosis, pancreatitis, visual impairment, sensory neuropathy, atrial fibrillation, pancreatitis, congestive heart failure, and psychiatric disorders such as depression, memory loss, poor concentration, anxiety, and stress.Proper hypoparathyroid patients"}

Girls who are suspected of having ASD experience the same core symptoms of their male counterparts. Although there are a number of ways in which males with ASD are different from females, the main difference is seen in the ways in which these children express ASD symptoms. In general, females express ASD symptoms in more subtle ways than males, and thus are diagnosed at a later age. In girls with ASD, the autistic behavior has been described as excessive concern with one or more aspects of play material, such craft materials, drawings, figures, or attention to one particular interest. Girls with ASD exhibit less aggression and hyperactivity than boys.375533,Describe ASD in adults. Many adults with ASD:\u2022Find social interaction challenging.

Any feelings of reduced fetal movement that cannot be explained by its ordinarily variable characteristics should be noticed and mentioned earlier to the doctor. A mother is supposed to reduce the idea of fetal movement in a specific time frame. Sudden stoppage of fetal movement is considered as a bad sign; still, it may not always lead to a fatal result. A slow decline in fetal movement could be a sign of poor growth; if prolonged, it could result in stillbirth 42-45. Sometimes unusual fetal movements can predict fetal growth impairment and share a connection with stillbirth 46. Women reported about losing fetal movement in their pregnancy duration taking care of daily life activities, e.g., taking a shower or rest 47,48, while others have reported losing count of their fetal movements on placing their tummies on flat surfaces.

Osteomyelitis is a complex disease process influenced by four main factors:1) bacterial infections and inflammation2) host/patient conditions (which affect systemic and local immune responses), 3) anatomic location, and 4) oxygen supply/demand tension in the bone caused by either vascular insufficiency or a hypermetabolic stateo Osteomyelitis is divided into two primary stages on the basis of active or mature disease processes. The acute/active stage, lasts from six weeks to three months and is characterized by local inflammatory evidence of acute and subacute inflammationo The acute/active stage is usually caused by a wide range of hematogenous-eremedone from the bone marrow-of not just Staphylococcae to bacteria (Sabet et al., 2017). The following anatomic compartments are most often characterized by active infection: vertebral column, posterior fossa, femur, anterior and posterior mandible, pelvic bones and any bone where there is a small amount of interstitial fluids (Omerovic et al., 2014). The treatment involves antibiotics and surgical removal of the infected boneo The mature/quiescent stage is a more mature weaning stage of osteomyelitis. In this stage, there is a replacement rather than an exclusion of inflammatory cells by osteoid and/or bone, as opposed to lymphocytes. The inflammation has slowed to a minimum.o Recurrences of the infection are often in the form of the mature/ quiescent phase ago The acute/active stage is followed by more mature stage called the chronic/ quiescent stage of osteomyelitis. The chances of recurrences are in contrast to the mature stage which is safer to treat and recurrences are rare with this stage (Borg et al., 2018)o Reversal to the acute/active stage is a rare phenomenon, and occurs in cases where there is a breach of continuity of surface of a bone"}

{"text": "Question: 72,What are the symptoms of binge? \n ### Answer: The most common symptoms of binge eating are: eating large amounts of food with a sense of loss of control and feeling guilt, shame, and/or disgust toward oneself after the binge. A lack of control can result in continued eating until one experiences physical discomfort, but not because one is hungry or is eating to avoid getting hungry again.After a binge there may be a sense of guilt, shame, and/or disgust toward oneself, this may result in a period of restricting food intake.Binges often occur two to four times per week for an average of 2 h in duration.Binge eating was previously considered part of the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, described by the binging-purging model found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. In the 5th edition published in 2013, binge eating is now recognized as its own eating disorder. (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-binge-eating-disorder-261225) .Binges often occur in response to external triggers, such as:There are diverse reasons for binge eating associated with negative emotions, such as boredom, loneliness, depression, anxiety, stress and anger. In these cases, eating is the way to soothe the negative feelings.There can be also specific triggers, such as certain places, people, sights, sounds, and smells: this is known as food cravings.For adolescents with binge eating uncertainties related to their body identity, increased body weight can generate concern about how the body will look to others. Food may then act as form of comfort in the face of shame and perceived rejection. It is important to take into consideration when a disorder is present during developmental stages."}
{"text": "Question: 73,What are the symptoms of bowel polyps? \n ### Answer: These findings may appear to contradict statements that polyps are commonly asymptomatic, but most hypotheses about the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer suggest that polyps develop over decades with relatively little inflammation. Because polyps slough, the \u201csmoking gun\u201d\u2014a large blood loss that draws the immune system to the site and initiates an inflammatory response to help heal the injury\u2014may appear only after the polyp is well-developed. The inflammatory response may be one factor that can cause the switch to a neoplastic phenotype in the cells that remained behind. (McKeeman and Burley 2003) However, polyps that cause bleeding may be particularly common in people who have not had cancer screenings in the past and have collected polyps during the early phases of preneoplasia. The other cases are indeterminate and may represent early neoplastic polyps, or polyps that are likely to develop into cancer, or simply larger polyps that had been missed previously. (Stead et al. 2019)It is important to note the difference between the inflammatory and neoplastic stages of colorectal carcinogenesis in this context. The inflammatory stage is almost always asymptomatic: It is during this stage that screening tests are most likely to discover polyps early. By contrast, the neoplastic stage typically has at least some symptoms.88,89Polyp removal has been shown to decrease cancer risk.90,91,92,93,94,95,96What is screening colonoscopy and why should I have one?"}

{"text": "Question: 77,What are the symptoms of low libido? \n ### Answer: Low libido is a medical condition in which a person experiences a lack of interest in sexual activity. It can affect both men and women and can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical health problems, psychological issues, and certain medications. Some common symptoms of low libido in men include a lack of interest in sexual activity, difficulty getting or maintaining an erection, and a decrease in the frequency of masturbation. In women, low libido can manifest as a lack of interest in sexual activity, difficulty becoming aroused, and a decrease in the frequency of vaginal lubrication. It is important to note that low libido can be a normal part of aging, but it can also be a sign of an underlying health problem. If you are experiencing persistent or bothersome symptoms of low libido, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}

Abnormalities in the presence of DIO entropy regarding the three questions can reveal what the clinician finds more surprising. In a sense, this guess is superior to our initial one, in which we split the questions into three. Many patients will present with severe morbidity secondary to involvement in mucosal surfaces and fluids, including in the oral cavity, esophagus, tracheobronchial tree, larynx and genitalia. Acute distress secondary to involvement of these regions can inform the clinician of the condition; however, the distress is a non-specific symptom.

{"text": "Question: 93,What are the synonyms for limp? \n ### Answer: (in this setting(a)) There are many texts which define a limp as the condition whereby an animal walks or runs with an abnormal gait. The problem here is that it\u2019s not clear that this term is really used defensibly for a set of behaviors where in particular not all four limbs may necessarily be implicated in producing the deviant gait for a consistent period of time. The noasis definition says \u201caligned gait,\u201d in fact, but also allows for non-continuous instances of limp. I don\u2019t want to quibble too much over this \u2013 noasis works fine for my kind of literature review and tutorial introduction topic \u2013 but that definition you cite for \u201climp\u201d in human medicine, \u201cLimp is the impairment of normal walking because of pain or weakness,\u201d isn\u2019t even consistent with Merriam-Webster: \u201cSomething weak or without strength, especially in a way that makes movement or effort difficult.

{"text": "Question: 94,What are the three basic types of speech impairments? \n ### Answer: Increase in displaced words, -empty words, -complex sentences, -double sentences -interrupted sentences and conduction typing. -reduced configuration and -changes in the sequence 93. First I am going to appoint three basic speech impairments:-words displacement-words empty-complex sentences1. Words displacement (paraphasias). Paraphasias is a wide range of speech disturbances such as designation of a name or an action, disruption of words, alteration of words' meaning. 2. Words empty (aphemias). Aphemias is recognized by a notable loss of speech that is often accompanied by a minimal and purposeless suitor gains. 3. Complex sentences (agrasias). Agarsias are sentences characterized by the poor order of structure and lack of sense. This type of agrasias has little effect on everyday communication. The three previous types are the most common difficulties that people face with speech. 92. Is the instability of the magnetic field around a magnet similar to jitter in speech? The sound produced during speech requires a very high degree of control of the respiratory organs and the system of the heart. Jitter in speech is a variation in intervals between consecutive sounds or letters. Imagine the corresponding variation in magnetic fields between the atoms of a magnet. It can be concluded that the magnetic field around the magnet fluctuates in time and space as does jitter in speech during its articulation."}

{"text": "Question: 99,What are the three types of developmental delays? \n ### Answer: Contributing to the debate is a large, online survey of infant brain researchers. This is frustrating. The participants in this survey are not researchers in the classical sense of the term; all of them are practitioners in the broadest sense of that term, and many are actually just parents, although the group is biased toward more traditional researchers (10 of the 32 responders gave corresponding postal addresses at U.S. medical schools). These participants are capable of genuine research\u2014I know this from personal acquaintanceship with several\u2014and just 6 months earlier Cohen-Mansfield prodiced a combined appearance with Susan Goldin as an infant cognitive researcher. But an online chat about Experimental Psychology is hardly Gerhard Eisner\u2019s laboratory in his lavish Munich retreat, nor is it comparable to the solitary cell biologists under the microscope in their laboratories.It is essential to describe the participants and their capabilities in greater detail if they are to be taken seriously as peers of the researchers from whose practices they solicitously desire to inform.It is also essential to the efficacy of their recommendations that participants be apprised of the basic principles and historical structures of how research is conducted to avoid the spread of misconceptions.This discursive presentation was hampered due to the scope and format of the journal in which it was published in 2012. Two cases in point: I shall not recount my personal knowledge of Mason, nor the complicated genealogical relationships of the last 15 or so years from Goldin to Cohen-Mansfield and others (which even Goldin does not address accurately in her review). Nor will I recount the additional metaphysical uses to which Eisner often put his colleagues\u2019 images for diverse marketing purposes (Figure 1).

The thirst stimulated by sodium chloride is said to be mainly physical and less psychological. An in vitro study showed that water the osmolality of water affected the blurring of sodium chloride channels . Changes in the concentration of sodium chloride ions outside and inside the cell can also affect the permeability of water channels and the movement of water , resulting in changes in thirst. 17, What is the difference between physiological thirst and psychological thirst? The main difference between physiological thirst and psychological thirst is that whether it is stable or variable. Physiological thirst is constant. It responds slowly in a linear manner and can be better explained and controlled . Psychological thirst often exhibits a biphasic response (the thirst biphasic response model): initially, a small amount of liquid causes the thirst to increase, and the thirst then decreases to a minimum value before increasing again ."}

{"text": "Question: 44,What are three signs of diabetic ketoacidosis? \n ### Answer: When excess glucose in the blood is not used for energy by insulin, glucose is broken down to provide energy for cells. When this occurs, ketones are produced. Ketones accumulate very quickly in the blood and make the blood more acidic. Diabetic ketoacidosis is the result of this collection of acidic ketones. It can occur in patients with diabetes mellitus when their blood glucose is high and when the insulin is not effective.

{"text": "Question: 62,What can be mistaken for erythema multiforme? \n ### Answer: Erythema multiforme may be mistaken for other diseases, such as disseminated lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus, pityriasis rosea, macular lavage, or lichen planus. 31 However, there are certain clinical features that help in distinguishing the diseases. Necrotic rash is absent in disseminated lupus erythematosus, but it is present in some atypical cases of erythema multiforme. Therefore, it is important to do a differential diagnosis with clinically apparent necrotic rashes. Chickenpox in children, morbilliform rash, or petechiae in dengue fever may also be confused for erythema multiforme. Pityriasis rosea is often blistering and rolling, but in the classic type of erythema multiforme, only small punctate lesions are present. Both hyper- and hypopigmented macules may occur after lichen planus, which, however, typically last longer but are less likely to be sharply demarcated. Tiny, pinpoint lesions are typical but not specific to erythema multiforme. If a bulla is pearly colored, it is likely viral. If it is red or purpuric, it may be erythema multiforme. In purpuric peripheral leg rash, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, in particular, needs to be considered. However, the specific differential diagnosis is only possible after histological evaluation. In suspected erythema multiforme, histological evaluation is not always required for confirmation or for the exclusion of syphilis. Syphilis mainly causes vesicles, ulcers, and papular-populono-vesicular rashes distributed on the palms and soles, the genitals, and the mucous membranes. In routine histological evaluation, the diagnosis of erythema multiforme is confirmed so that syphilis may be further ruled out. However, in several cases of erythema multiforme, spirochetes may be visualized in the histological evaluation. 54 In addition, smear staining for syphilis, in particular, using the Warthin-Starry stain, is also essential."}

Fertility can be impaired in people with abnormal periods. Non-ambulatory women and low income or underserved women are also most vulnerable to have limited access to treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding and this can cause the decreased fertility. These common gynecological problems may also indirectly contribute to the infertility problem this is because infertility problem can result in severe psychological distress to the affected women. \u2013 Because it evolved successively at later stage of life of a woman, we can consider it for prevention at later age of life.

We discussed with our group (clinical experts, a late scientist, a public health expert and an epidemiologist) the mechanisms involved in the onset of chronic fatigue syndrome. This is a complex disease and many factors are likely involved, so the mechanisms are still far from being explained. The mutation of the DQB1 gene is known to be necessary but not sufficient for the onset of the CFS. Some factors could play a key role alone according to pathways: parasites (viruses, bacteria), autoreactivity response against muscle proteins, auto-immune reaction against the nervous system at brain and enteric level, childhood adversity, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency (Table 1). Genes also participate in sensitivity to stress and ability to recover.

{"text": "Question: 01,What causes a period to be irregular? \n ### Answer: Irregular period Irregular periods can have several possible causes described next.a) Hormonal input. Irregular periods are associated with abnormal hormone levels. Implantation of pregnancy, stress, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and other hormonal imbalances can result in irregular periods. These disruptions occur because there is an absence of a viable fetus, stress, competing hormonal stimuli, insulin resistance, or other hormonal imbalance.b) Shift work. Shift workers frequently have irregular periods because of the disruption of normal circadian rhythm caused by sleeping irregular schedules.c) Premature hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013ovarian axis maturation (PHHM). This rare disorder, which is more common in African American young women, causes early maturation of the HPO axis. oo) Premature adrenarche in PHHM.

{"text": "Question: 42,What causes emotional detachment? \n ### Answer: Emotional detachment is caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, behavior, and early life experiences. In some individuals, high levels of emotional detachment may be a personality trait that develops in response to adverse life events, whereas in others, it may be a response to specific environmental factors. Prolonged exposure to stress or traumatic experiences can lead to a desensitization of the nervous system, making it difficult for the individual to experience emotions. Genetic factors may also contribute to emotional detachment, with certain individuals being predisposed to this trait due to variations in their genetic makeup. Additionally, detachment can be caused by the influence of other people, as well as a desire to protect oneself from emotional pain in the future.43,Detachment theory is a psychological theory. Which of the following is NOT a supposition of this theory? Detachment theory is a psychological theory that posits that individuals who are motivated to pursue self-protection goals may become emotionally detached and indifferent to others\u2019 suffering. This theory has four main suppositions: People can be classified into different categories based on their level of socioeconomic resource access. These categories include (1) ingroups, who are higher in resources; (2) outgroups, who are lower in resources; (3) people who are detached, who have deep emotional disconnection to bodily states; and (4) people who are indifferent, who lack empathy and a sense of self.Emotional detachment is a personality dimension that Schimmack and Blanton16 observed to be negatively associated with socioeconomic resource access.Individuals who are higher in resource access are less likely to engage in personal effort when confronted with potentially damaging threats to their access,while individuals who are lower in resources are more likely to engage in physical defense.Individuals with a greater sense of interdependence with similar others develop a more coordinated understanding of how to respond to emerging hazards."}

{"text": "Question: 48,What causes face to collapse? \n ### Answer: Not everyone gets it, but those who do are left clueless. Lee et al. were on a mission to uncover its cause. By exploiting conditional knockouts of Rabex-5, they found that RAB10 is necessary to form autophagosomes from Golgi-derived vesicles. These vesicles were found to be abundantly filled with archaemes and tubular binuclein, which are protein markers. However, RAB10 would need the help of its activators and effectors in order to fully exploit its connections to the disease. Most RAB10 variants are flexible, as 3R, although they are usually found in up to one-third of the cases. One mutant, P303L, which is located close to its binding site, was found to be less energy efficient and unable to produce ATP. The authors supported their claims by launching a retrospective database and finding a link between 3R variants and facial dysmorphology. Undoubtedly, these findings bring us closer to understanding and understanding the disease better. RAB10 could even become a therapeutic target, but we still need to know more about its interactome."}

{"text": "Question: 54,What causes haemochromatosis? \n ### Answer: In most patients the disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition; that is, a person must have two copies (two mutations) of the abnormal (iron absorbing) HFE gene, one from each parent, 55 to develop iron overload. Rarely, a form of haemochromatosis with dominant inheritance is seen, in which a person with a single copy (one mutation) of the iron absorbing HFE gene has iron overload, but in adults there can be incomplete penetrance of the disease. In less than 10% of patients, iron overload occurs from an inheritance pattern other than autosomal recessive: these include a juvenile, recessive, multihormonal form of haemochromatosis (with disease resulting from two copies of a mutation in each of the HJV and HAMP recessive genes, involved in production of hepcidin, which regulates iron absorption by the gut) 56 and the X-linked haemochromatosis, caused by a mutation in the hemojuvelin (HJV) gene inherited from the mother 57. On the other hand, although iron overload might be thought to result from the common iron deficiency anaemia (leading to initial excess iron absorption), this disease in turn generally results from a hereditary condition. 58 It is also known that disease usually results from iron excess starting in childhood: in developed countries, as in the UK, the probability of disease developing by age 30 years is 50% in males with one compatible mutation 59 and 79% in males homozygous for HFE C282Y mutations. 60 It is also recognised that haemochromatosis is clinically heterogeneous: iron excess may distribute to the pancreas 61 or focal organs such as the pituitary, testes, liver, 62,63 or skin. 64 Although HFE gene mutations may be associated with such disease variants as malignant amyloidosis, 65,66 and myopathy (or muscular dystrophy) on the basis of one mutation, C282Y in trans with a mild mutation (representing less than 5% of cases"}

Proper knowledge of prevention and control of the disease protections can contribute to the prevention of the epidemics from rising. It is not caused by mosquitoes but spread through the body fluids of infected individuals.62,What do you mean by CD 4?CD4 is a protein that is found on cells of the body\u2019s immune system. When a person is infected with HIV, the body\u2019s defence system tries to fight the infection using CD4 to help white blood cells also called lymphocytes to recognize and destroy virus-infected cells and other micro-organisms. The CD4 count can be used to determine the stage of the HIV disease and the progression into AIDS.63,Can HIV be cured?Once a person has been infected with HIV it is not possible to cure the disease, but if HIV patients adhere to Antiretroviral medication, they can stay healthy and below 10 copies of the viruses per millilitre of blood.64,What is an antiretroviral?Antiretroviral medicines are drugs that stop HIV from making more copies of itself. These drugs stop the progression of HIV and delay progression to AIDS. People living with HIV can live longer and healthier lives by taking antiretro viral drugs called HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment) for life.65,What is a condom?Condoms are devices used to prevent pregnancy and spread of diseases, it is a thin tube-like device that covers the penis during sex.

Some people have been coping reasonably well, some people are really finding the pain very difficult. That's your first starting point in terms of what causes irritable mood or (and) perhaps you want to rest that on some of your earlier evidence around the context and the whole picture. Some people are brought low by their pain, some people it doesn't really affect, doesn't affect them one way or the other, some people feel pretty depressed about it, some people feel more resilient, this (irritability) is one of the problems they face even more, so I think you need to flesh out a bit more there."}

As a patient with BD develops to the adult stages, their emotional reactivity is thought to become more badly dysregulated, resulting in mood swings lasting minutes, days, or weeks. Recurring fluctuations in mood in BD are not the result of the euthymic state, but rather the lack or insufficient treatment . It is widely known that patients with BD have abnormal temperament or emotional reactivity. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of these temperamental traits is linked to the age of onset of affective episodes. A connection between elevated neuroticism and mood instability has been established."}

However, for most people with asthma, there is no known specific cause, and instead many possible underlying causes. While asthma can be triggered by many things, the underlying cause is more complex. Researchers have found that a combination of your genes, your environment, your family history of asthma, and whether or not you were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero all play a role in determining what causes asthma.Research shows that asthma is more common in children with a family history of the disease. This can include parents, brothers and sisters, other relatives and even adopted children with asthma have parents with the condition.Whether or not you were exposed to passive smoke (tobacco smoke in the womb) is also important in causing asthma. For example, children who were exposed to passive smoke in the womb were 12 times more likely to develop asthma by age five than children who were not exposed.Research indicates that 60%-75% of making in childhood may be due to genetic (inheritable) factors. These include specific changes in the genes that control signals between immune cells and cells that make up the respiratory system.3738 Signals between the genome and environment are created through exposure to chemicals (including air pollutants, pesticides and industrial chemicals), diet and nutrition, and exposure to infections.491021"}

It is caused by swelling inside the joints due to imbalances in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6) damage articular cartilage, synovial tissue, and underlying bone through the recruitment of inflammatory cells 100. Inflammatory factors that drive osteoclast differentiation cause bone resorption and erosion. Immune cells and the synovial tissue also upregulate genetic factors that induce the maturation of osteoclasts 101. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines suppress the damage of articular tissues. In contrast to RA, osteoarthritis is non-inflammatory, and thus, no effect on bone was observed upon stimulation of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines."}

Painful neuropathies in diabetes are rare. However, we have to differentiate the beginning from the end. So the end variant of pain in diabetes is a chronic neuropathic pain, that we all know. That end variant can be due to different causes and for this I would refer to the colleagues of Internal Medicine.However, the beginning variant\u2026 ok, because the relationship between diabetes and several edematous conditions are very clear\u2026 Moreover, in neurological evaluation it's sometimes difficult to separate the beginning.

From where does it transform into this solid?At birth, bone marrow is soft and fluid, breaking on impact (so is thickened after maturity). It is solid and imbued with life on reaching maturity. 59.Why do worms damage flesh near the muscles?The thin furrow created by the worms serves as an entrance for the penetration of dampness via the meridian. 65.Why do old people limp?This is because of the unevenness of their bones as they get older(bad bone alignment), with the longer-lived leg always the lame leg with the shorter toe. In this manner, people who are predisposed to having long-lasting bones may also have long toes inter alia. 71.Abnormal redness , swelling  and tremendous pain in a detached part indicate that the (qi) blood has been injured.

Can acquired SIL become invasive vulvar cancer?33,60Squamous epithelium is sometimes a component of vulvar carcinomas and it is not always clear where a given case is to be classified. This article summarises different concepts that are relevant for the differential diagnosis of squamous lesions of the female genital tract based on histopathological and emerging molecular featuresspecific features shared by cervical lesions and vulvar epitheliumUnderstanding the normal features of vulvar squamous metaplasia is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL).The terminology used in the WHO classification of cervical cancers is also applicable to squamous lesions of the vulva. Several studies using molecular analyses have refined discrimination of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), but these are still not universally implemented as part of routine clinical practice. Recent papers on vulvar neoplasia have proposed a similar approach.Despite their anatomical location, vulvar SILs seem to follow the same stages and Cancer Prevention Colposcopy CN classifications as cervical lesions.The distinction between vulvar SIL, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma can be challenging. Recent studies have provided some markers that might prove useful in clinical settings.Ki-67 is a nuclear proliferative marker routinely used in the diagnosis of cervical cancers and may aid in distinguishing vulvar carcinoma in situ from invasive counterparts.Cytokines of the TNF/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway play an important role in the evolution of cervical cancers towards invasion.

If a nerve sends too many signals to a muscle, it is in the hyper\u2010excited state. Lastly, when there are too few signals being sent from a nerve to a muscle, it is in the inhibited state. Basically these concepts describe a range of normal and abnormal activity.14,What is disinfection?S1 PL2LCEA9BL8IHA1Disinfection is the process of removing or inactivating germs (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) from inanimate objects, living tissue or the environments.

{"text": "Question: 30,What does an ectopic heartbeat feel like? \n ### Answer: It\u2019s hard to describe until it happens to you: The slower/ faster heartbeat feeling in ones chest is sometimes accompanied by tunnel vision and light headed/ heavy arm or leg feelings as if they are tiring but your feet remain on the ground. This is especially scary when it occurs for the first time and you feel like you are going to DIE, however it is a warning of something incorrect, abnormal and something most likely in your own heart that is impeding blood flow. It can be your actual heart muscle, your heart rate regulating aorta or artery which needs a stent, or even a neuromuscular reaction to a cardiologist fishing out clots from one of your chambers. But if you can relate - it\u2019s a horrible feeling as if your body feels scared for a couple reason and functions to warn you death approaches. They call it pre-syncope and it can go away with one splash of adrenaline - a shot of steroids and your heart rate off into the non-danger fast zone of 110-140. The most fearful is when it\u2019s a new heartbeat which signals new clot dislodgement that can travel from your heart to your brain."}

{"text": "Question: 40,What does body image issues mean? \n ### Answer: Do these results mean that Stenberg endorsement supports healthy body image? Or unhealthy body image? Or body image among people with high scores on both subscales is worse than those low in both subscales? The problem with outlining relationships between different variables in different ways creates confusion as to whether Stenberg endorsement encourages healthy/less healthy body image or vice versa. In general, it seems the objective of this manuscript is trying to demonstrate that media standards lead to better body image. However, there are other potential implications of media standards, and the objectives and relevance of this paper blur when other implications emerge as possibilities, but are not explored (e.g., perhaps higher standards lead to more unhealthy body image in the short run but less in the long run?). I appreciate the bold nuance in the complex approach to the current work (inclusion in separate regressions of the endorsement of both positive and negative beauty concepts as outcomes), yet it seems unclear why the authors have chosen this as a main finding. Is the main point that the two are both a part of the story? Page 4 indicates there will be a separate investigation of the links between the media objective (standards) and media process variables (content, etc.), but it is not clear form the paper this following paper up what those findings were, and if they are relevant to the theme of body image. Although several limitations are offered, discussion of the many complicating factors affecting body image besides the effect of images is missing. Overall, the impression is that this study is trying too hard to justify media standards. To strengthen this research, the focus and organization needs streamlining."}

The patient must be carefully examined and monitored to measure blood pressure, pulse rate and investigations like hemoglobin, WBCs, creatinine, hepatic transaminases, blood grouping.

The capacity for youth to remember healthcare instructions, appointments, and treatments was seen as being a key determinant of whether they responded to treatment. Only those youth who were capable of understanding, remembering, and working with healthcare instructions could be expected to have positive treatment outcomes.\u201cWe also know that what can impact adherence is the fact that a lot of times HIV care has many components and a lot of pieces.

Subsequent absence of pain in jaw should be the prime point for pain jaw categorization.

Tay-Sachs disease is inherited as a recessive disease \u2013 patients are homozygous for the same mutation in one gene \u2013 which in the case of the \u03b2-hexosaminidase A gene is responsible for a deficiency of two lysosomal enzymes (hexosaminidase A [HexA] and hexosaminidase S [HexS]). HexAn, the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down gangliosides, accumulates into cellular inclusions within the lysosomes of neurons, resulting in slowly progressive neurodegeneration and neuronal death. The structural component of gangliosides provides another explanation for the propagating genetic disease aspect mentioned above, as gangliosides appear to be a recycling process."}

{"text": "Question: 63,What foods causes ulcer? \n ### Answer: Kings, Peng and Xie et al reported that the major dietary factors that influence the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer include salt, hot dishes, fried dishes coffee, hot tea and hot fruit juices, milk, and limited dietary gray chocolate exploration. Sea salt is a carcinogen which can increase the occurrence of stomach cancer by H. pylori. If the food is processed with salt, the incidence of gastric cancer seems to be relatively high. The consumption of salt by children on growth has not been confirmed, but the use of salt is harmful during the formation and development of the body. Lots of hot foods are more suitable for digestion and partially inhibit or eradicate helicobacter pylori. Spicy food decreases the gastric mucosal blood flow and effectively prevents the ulcer. Spicy food can reduce the directly inhibited effect of gastric acid on the active helicobacter pylori. Spicy increasing the temperature of the stomach, elevated general sensitivity, or the effect of regional hyperplasia increases the sensitivity of pain and reduces the probability of ulcer and gastric malignant tissue proliferation. Of course, however, excessive use of spices will irritate the stomach lining. Taken together the proper combination of these spices is beneficial for the stomach."}

{"text": "Question: 84,What happens if hypoparathyroidism is left untreated? \n ### Answer: Once the function of the parathyroid gland is lost, calcium levels fall. Plasma calcium is a regulatory aspect of endocrine function. In case of a hypocalcemic state, there are several intracellular mechanisms which are activated, especially in acutely lower calcium states. These involve several intracellular mediators (cytosolic), increase intracellular calcium accumulation, and activate vitamin D receptors, which in turn activate synthesis of parathyroid hormone. Severe hypoparathyroidism can affect some aspects of brain and body developmental process in the early decades of life. Some of these patients have lizard like faces due to growth development abnormalities. Intermittent calcium disturbances raise pancreatic enzyme release resulting in diarrhea. Some patients may also have increase in parathyroid hormone stimulated cryptococcal bacteremia and fungal infection because of immune dysregulation, which may be present in these patients. It can also predispose to nephrolithiasis. During pregnancy, the fetus is particularly susceptible to changes in calcium-phosphorus homeostasis, and function of the fetal parathyroid glands are particularly affected during the first half of pregnancy. Maternal hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy has been associated with several complications, including abortion and obstetric locomotor neuropathy. 1-4,84"}

{"text": "Question: 96,What happens if tennis elbow is left untreated? \n ### Answer: 30,If the pain of tennis elbow persists for more than one year, he/she is considered to have chronic tennis elbow (Stephens and Mannini 2007). Chronic physical work load causes the typical tenosynovitis to be replaced by a painful degeneration of the flexor structure, and the typical symptoms disappear slowly. At this stage the pain is now being reported in the forearm or wrist depending on which flexor or extensor tendons are affected, and point tenderness is usually extended to several sites on the extensor or flexor side. Extensor tendon involvement leads to extensor-bar toughness, and flexor tendon diseases lead to flexor bar flexibility impairment. Due to long period of disorder, necrosis and fracture of calcified tissues, some posterior implantation of tendons also occurred. The distal nerve branch may participate in the calcification of ectopic, and is more likely to have atypical pains, paresthesia and dysaesthesia in the palm or distal forearm (Garg and Dhillon2004).The calcification and rupture of thinned out tissue usually lead to permanent damage and disability (Hermanns and Henke 2005; Cutolo et al. 2008; Theaff and Chalmers 2009). Permanent physical disorder (and even paralysis) can be caused by, for example, the rupture or fracture of flexor tendons or the common planter tendons of the hand. This can be extended to paralysis of finger joints and thumb abduction. Damages to the extensor retinaculum are usually far severe compared with those of the flexors due to the common nature of the flexor tendons. Extensor tendons can be pulled back together or compressed leading to the ankyloses of the fingers. After such a severe progression, only surgical treatment can provide a good prognosis. However, this is only provided that the symptoms caused by delayed intervention have not caused irreversible damage to the structures such as tendons."}

{"text": "Question: 98,What happens if trigeminal neuralgia is not treated? \n ### Answer: The chronic pain experienced by patients with Trigeminal Neuralgia can persist and may even worsen over time. While there are no known life-threatening complications associated with Trigeminal Neuralgia, the condition can have a negative impact on an individual\u2019s overall quality of life, including their ability to perform daily tasks, have social interactions and get enough sleep. It is therefore recommended that anyone diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia work closely with their healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan to help alleviate their symptoms and prevent flare-ups. If left untreated, this chronic pain condition can sometimes progress to unbearable. 99,There is currently no cure for trigeminal neuralgia. Therefore, treatment goals are focused on alleviating the pain rather than eliminating it.There is no known cure for Trigeminal Neerialgia, and treatment options may vary depending on the severity of the pain and individual. Most treatment options focus on managing pain and preventing pain flare-ups.100,Nauseated.Photosensitivity.Photophobia.Altered taste.It is important to report any changes in taste, as well as any new symptoms, to the healthcare practitioner. If not properly managed, Trigeminal Neuralgia can worsen over time and cause more frequent attacks.101,There are several treatment options available for Trigeminal Neuralgia, including medication and surgery. The right treatment plan will depend on the individual, and may vary over time as the condition changes. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan.102,There are several different medications that may be prescribed to treat Trigeminal Neuralgia, such as anticonvulsants, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics. The goal of Trigeminal Neuralgia treatment is to alleviate pain and prevent pain flare-ups. It is important to discuss any concerns about side effects with the prescribing physician.Current methods of treating this condition are aimed primarily at controlling pain, much of which is TN related nociception (stenosis, inflammation), neuropathic (not nociceptive TN related) pain.

{"text": "Question: 20,What happens to the body during septic shock? \n ### Answer: The clue to survival lies in understanding the inflammatory response behind sepsis and septic shock. It is now known that sepsis can trigger 300 separate proteins within the human body that are involved in different stages of the sepsis reaction. Some of these proteins, such as erythropoietin and IL-6 have been found to interrupt or change the way sepsis proceeds and may have a significant impact on patients by delaying, changing or reducing serious complications of sepsis. But administering high-dose IL-6 inhibitor therapy to all septic patients hasn\u2019t been shown to be effective in preventing or modifying the course of the disease. Equally, carrying out blood tests on all cases of sepsis to look for elevated levels of erythropoietin, CD14 and granulocyte/monocyte may prove to be of no diagnostic value and do more harm than good in terms of cost and time.What this research adds Crucial to developing effective preventative and therapeutic interventions to modify sepsis and septic shock is the understanding of how these acute conditions present and progress by measuring changes in patients\u2019 inflammatory responses to infection. The acute phase proteins erythropoietin, IL-6 CD14, sIL-2r and MHC-I are elevated in patients with sepsis. Levels of IL-6 and sIL-2r elevations correlate well with the number of organ dysfunctions, patients with more sepsis-related organ dysfunctions also having higher levels of IL-6 and sIL-2r. As sepsis becomes more severe, nuclear factor (NF)- \u03baB inhibitor C oxidase (ICO) levels decrease, while systemic inflammatory response syndrome-induced protein (SIRS-2)1 levels increase.Knowledge gaps Much work is needed to determine and characterize the inflammmatory response that occurs in the later stages of sepsis. This requires developing animal models not only appropriate to the late (as opposed to early) stages of sepsis, but also those that not only investigate pathophysiological changes that occur in cardiovascular, immune, and tissue systems, but also in the nervous system. The best animal models for studying sepsis are those involving human infection, other large mammals"}

{"text": "Question: 23,What happens when an animal bites you? \n ### Answer: Obviously, according to my theory, an animal [force] acts on the integument at the place of the bite, causing [the integument] to be forcibly displaced and producing painful stimulation in the effected part of the body. And as in the case of strikes, the animal sometimes exerts such a force as to overwhelm the available resistance in the part struck, sometimes not. A biting dog usually inflicts a greater trauma than would otherwise happen in the same impact of a wing or foreleg of another bird. But in the case where the impact would overcome the resistance of the skin, the force would pene\u00actrate beyond the skin and evoke in effect a serious wound. If the dog did not exert enough force or full strength, or if the weak stratum corneum was reinforced by the effect of another, the animal might seal a mark without breaking through to the integument in a more invorporated epithelium like the esophagus. Still, even in this case there follows painful stimulation and a force with which the biting animal resists being drawn away or repelled. Omitting the other effects of bites to which I will return later, I hold that the bite evokes acute pain immediately."}
{"text": "Question: 24,What happens when blood gets clot? \n ### Answer: Blood clots are formed when blood coagulates. Coagulation is the process of blood clotting to stop bleeding in case of injury. When blood coagulates, it forms a semi-solid mass called a blood clot. Blood clots are formed in the blood vessels. There are two types of blood clots. The first type is a venous thrombus. It occurs in the veins. The second type is an arterial thrombus. It occurs in the arteries. Blood clots can be dangerous. They can cause a heart attack or stroke. They can also cause deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body, usually in the leg. If a blood clot is not treated, it can grow and block the blood flow. This can be very dangerous. It can even be life-threatening. That is why it is important to go to the doctor if you think you have a blood clot. The doctor can give you medicine or surgery to remove the blood clot."}

[\u2026] we implicitly assumed an additive fertility function, which is partly true [\u2026] and so then every woman produces children at an average g(x) which might very well depend on x. So it\u2019s an assumption [\u2026] Ceteris paribus is highly inappropriate to describe [\u2026] if you\u2019re modeling consumption because you want to include the whole structure of the economy.

We talked to three contributors from the mood-related episode (C4) to answer this question. They thought that stress leads to poor eating habits through two mechanisms. First, because their body perceives the food eaten as \u201ccomfort food\u201d, it releases hormones to make them feel better. Second, negative emotions such as \u201cfeeling kind of depressed, or jealous, or upset, or sad, or just stressed out\u201d about their academic performance.

The question that immediately comes to my mind is whether there is any \u201ctypical TS\u201d left anymore, considering the diversity of TS patients. Jerrold\u2019s question should be better formulated to obtain practical information: \u201cDo any of you have additional diagnoses besides those associated with TS? If so, what are they?\u201d Because the medications that TS patients take (e.g., antihistamines and antidepressants) would have no effect on reversing TS-related phenomena, TS researchers as well as clinicians should inquire more precisely about what symptoms are included in the TS phenotype and which ones are caused by medications (Banaschewski et al., 2009; Chudley et al., 2012). Surely, patients are aware that they can also get sleep problems (especially if they take medications) or depression, but such medical problems are not all caused or worsened by TS. Focusing on distinguishing the nonpsychotic symptoms exhibited by TS patients from those induced by medications could help researchers and clinicians to better discriminate affected and unaffected individuals, and to compare the psychophysiology of TS alone and TS associated with a comorbidity."}

{"text": "Question: 52,What helps with vulvodynia pain? \n ### Answer: Beginning with non-hormonal therapies, \u00bf62gm bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) suppositories have received positive feedback (Table 1) for vulvodynia pain. Providers also recommend topical lidocaine and lidocaine patches, which have received mixed reviews. Among less commonly used pharmaceuticals, glyceryrrhizin (shown to have an inhibitory effect on free radicals and inflammation) and Momentum Silicone Lubricant base (which contains soy isoflavones) have shown some efficacy in decreasing pain severity. Physical therapy and exercise form a cornerstone of non-hormonal interventions for vulvodynia. Pelvic-floor exercises are intended to reduce tension in the pelvic-floor muscles, which often tighten with vulvodynia.

{"text": "Question: 72,What is a low fertility rate? \n ### Answer: Low fertility rate refers to a fertility rate below the replacement level. Generally speaking, the replacement level reflects the birth rate required to maintain the size of a stable population. If the birth rate is lower than the replacement level, it will lead to a decrease in population; if the birth rate is higher than the replacement level, it will lead to a rise in population.

NSAIDs have anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties, while acetaminophen does not.31,32 When considering these effects, partnering non opioid medication such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs, with or without opioids, may be more appropriate than partnering opioids with non opioid medication such as benzodiazepines. 16,Do caregivers usually know when older adults have pain ?Caregivers may not be aware of when older adults have pain, 13 and older adults may be less likely to report their pain. 14 Therefore, it is important to assess older adults for pain directly and to educate caregivers on the subject. 5  Grading tools 35,36 and pain resource testing may be useful . 17,How many older adults does a general practitioner inappropriately prescribe opioids to?It is estimated that 1 in 8 persons in the United States use opioid medications, However, a quarter of those surveyed reported to be misusing the opioids, reporting taking them without a prescription, at higher doses, for longer duration, and/or for reasons other than treating chronic pain. 9,37 Therefore, when prescribing opioids to older adults, it is important to assess for misuse. 18,Is it safe to discharge older adults with neuropathic pain on gabapentinoid therapy?Older adults are more likely to experience side-effects from gabapentinoid therapy. 29 There is still a modest amount of research evaluating gabapentinoid therapy for"}

{"text": "Question: 17,What is bronchiolitis vs bronchitis? \n ### Answer: \u2217More details #42InsightVery nice little video\u2026but bronchiolitis and bronchitis share the name bronchiolitis, but are very different conditions that are sometimes confused with each other. Specifically bronchiolitis is a viral infection of the smaller airways (the bronchioles) affecting mostly children under 2 years of age while bronchitis refers to inflammation of the lining of larger airways (the bronchi or main stem bronchi). Children with bronchiolitis have inflammation of the bronchioles, excess fluid in their alveoli causing serious back up of secretions and they are dead-space ventilators. Children with bronchitis may have inflammation of the bronchi and increased secretions but do not generally have the lining of smaller airways involved. The wheezing may be more pronounced with bronchiolitis. Both can end up with the need for supportive therapy such as oxygen and antibiotics in severe cases.\u2217\u2217Patient educationRead OnlyThe exact cause of bronchiolitis is still unknown but RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is the most common cause. Other viruses that cause bronchiolitis include influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus. This chart lists the most common viruses identified by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic evaluating a large number of children over multiple years.[15, 16]Other causes of bronchiolitis may include allergens and air pollution.Allergens\u2217AllergensCarbonyl, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and oxidized ozone produce free radicals that can injure airways the wrong way. Interleukin 4 and 5 and tumor necrosis factor can recruit eosinophils that can release inflammatory compounds and proteases that can destroy elastic fibers in lung walls. Interleukin 13 enhances this and interferes with normal repair processes.[12, 13]Patient educationRead OnlyIn children, bronchiolitis commonly occurs in the winter season.\u2217\u2217PreventionEach year in the United States, approximately 135,300 infants and school-age children are hospitalized for bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial"}

{"text": "Question: 19,What is called the change of the size of an image? \n ### Answer: What corresponds to enlarged or reduced size? The concept that words have many different meanings must be well comprehended. Usually, we need a single word for a phrase. In this case, that word cannot be expressive of the change of one or more characteristics of an image, as size is a characteristic. It is so because a picture can be enlarged in size yet its details not enlarged as well. It is possible, however, this can also occur in reduction in size. Alongside with enlarging and reducing the size of an image, we can, e.g., enlarge or reduce an image\u2019s details. However, the question is, if we keep the size of the original intact, what are we in doing so? Besides, what is the image with its details reduced? Something different from an image. Without doubt, when we say \u2018an image with its details enlarged\u2019, that image said to have not been enlarged, but rather its details enlarged, because it was itself kept the same. In conclusion, by the most is meant enlargement (amplification) of the number of pixels that make up an image.

{"text": "Question: 32,What is COPD life expectancy? \n ### Answer: Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD guidelines say \u201cChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease that is characterised by airflow limitation that is usually both symptomatic and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases.\u201d In a review of 4007 patients with discharge diagnosis of COPD over 30 years at a Canadian medical centre, correlation between chronic airflow limitation and survival was observed, with lower survival in patients with more severe airflow limitation, in patients over 40 years of age, and in patients with comorbidities such as ischaemic heart disease and other cancers.49 This is because as the lungs are exposed to tobacco smoke and other irritants, these foreign particles trigger the body\u2019s immune system to produce inflammatory cells to fight off the invaders and clear the airways of irritants. Chronic exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollutants, or other lung irritants causes a chronic inflammatory response that narrows the airways and damages the lungs, making it harder to breathe and leading to severe disease progression. These inflammatory changes do not necessarily produce symptoms initially, but as the narrowing of airways and damage worsens, the need for greater effort to breathe leads to cough, sputum production, breathlessness, fatigue, and ultimately breathlessness at rest. Cigarette smoke and air pollutants increase inflammation particularly at the smallest airways. Neutrophils that release proteases that damage epithelial cells are particularly important.50 In animal studies, the first response to damage is fibrosis. As this carries on, alveoli are damaged and reduce in size with fatal consequences for gas exchange.51 Survival curves have been developed based on 3 predictors, forced vital capacity, cardiac comorbidity, and age. Patients less than 40 survive longer than those aged over 40 because the younger patients are usually less affected by comorbidity. The GOLD document emphasises that people with COPD may experience acute episodes of breathlessness termed \u201cCOPD exacerbations\u201d which are episodes of increased intensity or frequency of cough, sputum production, or breathlessness. A COPD exacerbation typically begins with a"}

{"text": "Question: 37,What is diabetes insipidus and its symptoms? \n ### Answer: For more information, see: Golkowski et al. (2004 39 )Although much of the brain is involved in regulating ADH release, the hypothalamus is the substantial location of the complex neuroendocrine network associated with the control of ADH secretion. Diabetes insipidus is the most common chronic disorder of ADH-reduced secretion and results in an inability to conserve water in the body because of a deficient ADH response to increased plasma osmolality. Deficiency or insensitivity of adjunct atoms to ADH in the renal tubule warrant the dilute urine production that characterizes diabetes insipidus. 57 , 58 The main symptoms of central diabetes insipidus are excessive thirst and extremely dilute urine, which usually produces nocturnal enuresis. Most of the patients are also extremely weak, often experiencing extreme sleep disruption. 57 , 58 Neurons located in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary secrete ADH, which mediates responses by the kidney and/or the pituitary gland. ADH and vasopressin (VP) are primarily distributed to the hypothalamus, posterior pituitary, and in small quantities to peripheral tissues. 59 ADH also regulates the release of cortisol and growth hormone. 59 , 60ADH is also involved in a variety of other biological functions, including the control of food intake, 61 but one of its most essential functions is the conservation of water. 62 When dehydration or raised osmolality, the ADH is secreted and travels via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system to the posterior pituitary where it is expressed and then released from by exocytosis. Secretion of ADH is primarily based on the increase in central extracellular concentrations. The effect of ADH is absorbed by specialized receptors (V1 and V2), and uptake by the receptors causes closure of vascular smooth muscle cells' plate cyclic adenosine monophosphate-gated channels and decreased water permeation. Thus, due to decreased water movement from the blood"}

{"text": "Question: 50,What is earache caused by? \n ### Answer: In medical terms, earache is caused by a bacterial or viral infection within the middle ear cavity. If the middle ear cavity is inflamed by bacteria, the pus which is produced is usually drained through the Eustachian tube to the back of the nose. If the Eustachian tube is not functioning properly, it stops the pus from draining and as a result pressure builds up inside the middle ear cavity. This causes painful pressure on the eardrum, and sometimes a person can also experience hearing loss while the eardrum is squeezed. If the middle ear cavity is inflamed through the Eustachian tube by a viral infection, the usual symptoms in children are earache and fever. Typically, antibiotics are not required for viral infections. Most of the time, viral ear infections clear up on their own and the inflammation in the eardrum subsides.63"}

Grinding is widely used in many industries because of its excellent surface quality, economic feasibility and environmental protection [1, 2]. The grinding process is composed of cutting and ploughing stages. In the preliminary stage, the workpiece surface is formed at the cutting edge portion of the grinding wheel due to the abrasion of the metal tungsten tip on the machined surface, so as to get the cutting path and restore the shape of the machined surface. The wear metal tungsten tip after the preliminary stage is further abrased, and the chatter marks with a small working area are formed on the machined surfacewith the grinding wheel moving."}

In essence, \u201csemantic compression\u201d is a method for finding highly associated words and phrases in a given set of texts. The technique is useful for summarizing views given by individual respondents by automatically distilling a set of the most common words and phrases provided in their written responses. Our analysis focused on the responses of 4514 patients following a hypothetical medical deviance in an emergency situation. The health communication text classification task was performed on a source text, a balanced reference text, and a trained targeted opinion classifier. Once identified with a high degree of accuracy (F1-score = 0.731), our analysis focused on the \u201cnegative\u201d text comments of these respondents.

Urgent further investigation and IVIG treatment is imperative. Coronary artery aneurysm is the primary complication of Kawasaki disease. In cases where coronary arteries are severely affected, myocardial ischaemia, and even sudden death could occur.83,101100,Since Kawasaki disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, abnormal imaging studies may narrow the differential diagnoses. Please see the CDC guidelines for full lists of criteria and further workup: https://www.cdc.gov/kawasakidisease/diagnosing.html.Heart disease, in particular, can be fairly accurately diagnosed by echocardiography, but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is preferred for diagnosis of large aneurysms. Cardiac catheterization is not routinely recommended as the only reliable method of assessing coronary artery aneurysm in patients with KD.

{"text": "Question: 37,What is stiffness example? \n ### Answer: If I understand correctly, the pi- proportional error between a graph of zx and y data provides certain amount of dynamic stiffness. It is accounting for deviation from \u201cnormal\u201d behaviour and low value means that the system is \u201csoft\u201d, high\u2014\u201cstiff\u201d, i.e.\u201d8.65 ||22.41813620.1488900\u201d. So, if the system has very pronounced shocks, the dynamic stiffness will be high, so the above equation will check whether the error is meaningful or not. By using the coefficient pi, the above equation will be responsible for the result when among the coefficients pj higher values (usually k form) dominate, which can be interpreted as a more noticeable- where is k form or others- non-linearity of the system. So, if by approximation the above equation is applied in graph C (left) I get an approximation of the stiffness- is it so? If I understand correctly, this allows to model the dependencies of error on the history of stress. Of course, this is just a kind of funny example of such an error. But it may allow to filter out the \u201clies\u201d of the \u201cnoise\u201d from the data and estimate the real trend more accurately. To better remind this graph you can use your own annotations as well as metal surface defects that could cause the destruction of a product during the production of metal products such as cracks, plate cracks, clay cracks, porosity and scratches. Let\u2019s take throw in producing heat treatment. If after the process, if there are a lot of scratches in the profiles or in the surface, then the level of the method of destructive control will be soft. But I think, this is only one of many defects that can be examined in rolling equipment and considering the production of aluminium alloys. Consider throwing Al 7 NZ. A lot of problems: 1- Scraping 2- Bars with \u201corange\u201d colour 3- Breakout 4- Coating change, and so on. Surface coating change appears due to incorrect cleaning of the rolling mills. If it is found at the destruction inspection stage that the production technology is not correct, that will put clogs. Therefore, the coloration of the bar in blue and orange will also indicate this situation and will be a sign and will determine the magnitude of the weakness"}

{"text": "Question: 46,What is the average age for a woman to have breast cancer? \n ### Answer: The average age for a woman to have breast cancer is 62. However, breast cancer can occur at any age, even for those under 40. Earlier detection lowers the chance of dying of breast cancer.47,What is the average age for a man to have breast cancer?About 1 in 4 breast cancers develop in men, and the average age to be diagnosed is 68. This is almost 15 years later than the average age for women. However, breast cancer can occur at any age. Early detection is important to all.48,Could a woman develop breast cancer if she's had her breasts removed?Removing one or both breasts (mastectomy) lowers a woman\u2019s chance of developing breast cancer. In women with one breast removed, cancer may develop in remaining breast tissue. In women with both breasts removed, new breast tissue and muscle growth occur in the chest, and this may have a small chance of developing breast cancer. The decision to have a mastectomy is a personal choice and should be made only after careful consultation with a health professional.49,Are the same screening techniques used for all ages?No, screening techniques vary by age.50,At what age should a man get a screening test?Men of all ages should be aware of their body and any changes; they should talk to their doctor if they notice anything unusual. And, a man should have a breast doctor (physician) check him effectively at least once in his lifetime.51,At what age should women get a screening test?Women in their 40s should talk to their doctor about their risk for breast cancer and should have a screening mammogram once every year.52,(V) Knowledge items\u2013true/false questionsQ38,Radiation therapy cannot shrink a tumor since it does not directly kill cancer cells.TrueQ39,Radiation therapy after breast cancer can lower the chance of the cancer coming back either in the breast area or in another part of the body.TrueQ40,Typically, mild swelling, redness, fatigue, or skin pain around the breast area immediately after breast surgery is normal and usually resolves in 1\u20132 weeks.TrueQ41, A healthy breast will not typically have a notch in the circumference of the breast where the breast meets the chest wall.TrueQ42,A mammogram screening for breast cancer usually"}

{"text": "Question: 48,What is the best cream for an itchy bottom? \n ### Answer: [Answer: The best cream for an itchy bottom depends on the cause of the discomfort. If the cause is a bug bite or an allergic reaction, an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or ointment can help reduce inflammation and itching. If the cause is hemorrhoids, an over-the-counter cream or suppository containing lidocaine, benzocaine, or witch hazel can provide temporary relief from pain and itching. It is important to determine the cause of the symptoms and consult a healthcare provider before applying any medication, particularly if the symptoms persist or are severe."}

There would be a slight equivocation if one educated provider said one and another another even though that is in fact likely in practice and no worse than a patient trial in individual children (but slightly on the conservative side).If so then I would expand upon this in the discussion. It is important, I feel to counterbalance with a description of what is available and what the family should expect. At minimum advice that an antimicrobial cream should be used would be valuable in my view as that would cover all the bases and be realistic (that is the alternative of bubble bath)."}

{"text": "Question: 54,What is the best deodorant for bromhidrosis? \n ### Answer: 30,60,12,Bromhidrosis refers to a condition where the sweat released possesses an obnoxious odor. This state is a result of the proliferation of microbes in the viscous secretions released by the sweat glands. these aroma bearing sweat glands are more active during the night and are distributed in the apeach fomes of the axilla, however, sweating of the more proximal limbs during the day prior to the evening moisture confers a somewhat similar deodor. The microbes involved in malodor production include those normally ingested as well as opportunists. Cessation of eating spicy food, carbohydrates, and fats may indulge these processes. Lavender and oats baths are reported useful but one may test various preparations including application of commercially available deodorants prior to bedtime during the cold weather.

{"text": "Question: 65,What is the best treatment for diabetic retinopathy? \n ### Answer: Because of the worldwide prevalence and disability resulting from diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a public health concern, as it causes blindness. This review provides thorough information for patients, physicians, pharmacists and investigators. No preventative strategy for the onset or progression of DR is available. The targets of glycemic control have been less precise for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes as compared to type 1 diabetes. Reducing the risk of vision threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) was targeted in patients with diabetes with established cardiovascular disease or with a demonstrated risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover the \u22121.0% HbA1c decrease from standard to intensive treatment reduced the risk of VTDR in patients with type 2 diabetes by 34%, probably as a result of glycaemic control. Of note, there is no clear data about the efficacy of different hypoglycemic agents in preventing or treating DR. Thus, more research is warranted in order to decipher the most effective preventative agents for DR.Both patients and physicians should be conscious of DR prevention and treatment. Stringent glycemic control will undoubtedly result in targeted HbA1c control. More research is warranted regarding approaches for primary prevention of progression to DR. Primary and tertiary care physicians should also be aware of early symptoms of retinopathy and DRcomplications in order to reference patients to an ophthalmologist. More research is also needed, to study the risk in specific populations and to compare the efficacy of various antidiabetic agents with control groups in order to develop guidelines for preventing complications.8Naghibi, H & Roshani, KHow much money should governments spend for treating diabetic retinopathy in their societies?A systematic literature review was carried out in order to find the socioeconomic effects of diabetic retinopathy. The findings demonstrate that the rate of blindness as a result of diabetes has increased recently. Furthermore, the costs of treating these patients have imposed a heavy burden of expenditure on the governments. In fact, the cost of treatment has surpassed the treatment of certain cancers. Efforts must be made in order to have uniform methods for evaluating different aspects of DR economic impact. The economic burden of this disease is undoubtedly"}

Does that sound right?We may also look at the eardrum to see whether there is perforation as often times that is in place to help assist in reducing the amount of bacteria that is in the middle ear space. Okay.utilitiesIn other words, you want to look at the eardrum to see if there is an eardrum perforation present, which would sort of decrease the amount of effort the body has to do to fight off these infections. Yes.utilitiesAnd also as a result of that perforation, the viruses and bacteria have a pathway to enter into the middle ear space. Is that correct?The wording we used was the perforation reflects the repeat eardrum perforation. How about we add the \u201cregarding\u201d and say that it's there is probably a pathway from the initial perforation from fluid getting into the middle ear space.inutility I would have also liked to see some screening question in here, as an example, Is there any evidence that (husband's) ototoxic medication may have caused any problems with his hearing or balance?Because that's something you're going to want to try to avoid in potential future pregnancies, or do you want to consider weaning the patient off of the medication?sellingObviously, they are a family, but I really would have liked to remind you that we are talking about a patient's hearing.

{"text": "Question: 81,What is the best treatment for vestibular schwannoma? \n ### Answer: There is no standard treatment for small vestibular schwannomas, and consideration of several factors should guide the choice of treatment option. Patients with small to medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (3\u20134 cm) generally have knee jerk hyperreflexia and facial palsies, and in these patients microsurgical resection through a translabyrinthine opening is indicated because the facial nerve is sacrificed in the process. When managing large vestibular schwannomas (> 4 cm in diameter), the larger size and slower growth rate of the tumour imply that facial nerve sacrifice is associated with additional loss of marginal facilities for hearing because of large distortion of the nerve and its helix. Therefore, other management options for larger tumours should be considered because of these decreased complete hearing preservations. In these cases, radiotherapy may be offered.Microscope microsurgical resection through translabyrinthine opening, RadiotherapyCryotherapy Chemical treatmentSTEROIDSElequadin et al., (1998), Khan et al., (2001), Nicola and Jackson, (2004), Baker, (2005)Nicola and Jackson, (2004), Baker, (2005), deafness 26\u2022Venous thromboembolism\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202282.What tests must be included in preoperative assessments for patients with schwannoma of the CPA?

What are the basic criteria for successfully treating intravenous drug users with periprosthetic joint infections? Therapeutic lifestyle change: Abstinence from drug abuse and change in social environment and behavior to prevent reinfection and relapse. Early recognition and intervention: Early intervention and management can prevent complications. Reoperation and antimicrobials: Debridement, removal of implant if possible, and long course of antimicrobials. Long-term follow-up: Medical follow-up every 3 to 6 months within the first 2 years, and yearly thereafter. Patient education about the disease and its potential complications are important.

{"text": "Question: 89,What is the cause of glue ear? \n ### Answer: It is a common otologic disease seen in pediatric ENT clinic. According to authors the cause of fluid accumulation is not well known. It is an accumulation of nonphlogistic, nonmechanical, and nearly non-viscous fluid in the middle ear space. It is seen more in children between 6 and 16 months of age. It has been reported that Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction is a possible cause of glue ear. ET will not show complete obstruction but will show decreased in diameter which in turn will compromise normal ventilation and drainage of middle ear. An alteration of imdanoplasm in ET will also increase the rate of infection and debris to the middle ear space. Other possible causes of this condition are acute otitis media, plural disease, infections, and decreased clearance mechanism. It is discussed that negative pressure in the middle ear space will draw bacteria from the Eustachian tube to middle ear.

{"text": "Question: 04,What is the difference between arterial and venous thrombosis? \n ### Answer: Arterial thrombosis occurs in the artery due to increased blood flow caused by stenosis or occlusion of the artery (Atherosclerosis, embolus, spasm), which hypertrophies due to impaired blood flow and causes myocardial infarction or cerebral infarction. The characteristic symptom of arterial thrombosis is a sudden onset. In addition, arterial thrombosis occurs at a younger age and occurs in a selective location such as the myocardial anterior descending branch of the coronary artery or the proximal end of the anterior cerebral artery. Venous thrombosis occurs in the cavities or vessels that maintain blood flow to the low-pressure level such as the inferior vena cava, the right atrium, the pulmonary vein, and the brain vein. It is characterized by slowness, and the age of onset is older than that of arterial thrombosis. Since the arterial and venous blood flows often initiate thrombosis with the same origin (dysregulation of hemostatic and thrombolytic mechanisms), it is often clinically difficult to distinguish arterial thrombosis, which occurs at a lower-pressure level at the epicenter of thrombosis formation, from venous thrombosis, which occurs at a higher-pressure level, and it is easy to occur in a state after exposure to a stent by PCI, etc. For detailed diagnosis, D-dimer tests and various types of imaging such as ultrasound measurements, CT scans, and MRIs should be combined. D-dimer >30 mcg/mL, which indicates hyperinsulinemia, is defined as venous disease caused by thrombosis. However, if the D-dimer concentration is low, arterial thrombosis must be the cause."}

{"text": "Question: 14,What is the difference between diabetes mellitus and insipidus? \n ### Answer: both result to hyperglycemia.148,4531Insulin secretes excess sugar from the bloodstream while ADH secretes excess water. In diabetes mellitus, the sugar cannot be utilized by the cells which could lead to death, while in diabetes insipidus an individual excretes excess water in the urine which can be life threatening. ADH is a nonapeptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. Its release into the bloodstream causes reabsorption of water in the kidney thereby decreasing the volume of the urine. The actions of ADH are partly inhibited by osmotic pressure of urine and vessels in the kidney.148,1772Osmotic pressure is a process in which molecules move down their concentration gradients down through semipermeable membranes until equilibrium of solute concentration is achieved on either side. The dissolved particles in water are known as solutes. This movement of molecule is known as osmosis. Osmotic pressure outside the cell is higher than inside the cell and water moves into the cell liquid to restore the equilibrium. Isotonic, Hypertonic, and Hypotonic refer to the condition of the molecules present on either side of the membrane. In isotonic condition, solutes concentration outside the cell is equal to that of inside the cell. In hypertonic condition, solutes are concentrated outside the cell and in hypotonic, solutes are concentrated inside the cell.136,0373In Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the kidneys fail to reabsorb water because of lacking or nonfunctioning arginine vasopressin receptors. Too much volume of the fluid is excreted and is the cause of excessive thirst. In central diabetes insipidus, the pituitary gland doesn\u2019t produce arginine vasopressin.(In Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, arginine vasopressin is produced but does not work. While in central, arginine vasopressin is not produced at all.)010944Hypotonic refers to a solution or plasma with a solute concentration is lower than that of normal saline, and it is diluted at osmotic equilibrium.

{"text": "Question: 20,What is the difference between esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula? \n ### Answer: *Esophageal atresia implies discontinuity of the esophagus and varying degrees of absence of the cervical segment of the esophagus. Association with trachea-esophageal fistula embraces a large range of variations in number of circuits and their respective characteristics, either terminal or end-to-side, single or double, azygos, and so on. The most common form of tracheoesophageal fistula is the type that has its exit at the post-cricoid area of the trachea. Azygos type leads to the azygos channel, a space above the diaphragm. The cranial variation of the azygos tracheoesophageal fistula is the one of clinical significance.*21.What is the embryological origin of esophageal atresia?*The esophagus arises from the fourth and sixth pairs of pharyngeal arches. According to phenotypic changes in normal embryogenesis, it is formed at the corner of the perichondrium and neural crest of the pharyngeal arches, parts that may or may not ever develop (depending on the individual and the phase of development). In the most common ectoderm phenomenon, the esophagus is formed due to the object of the fourth arched pharyngula (the posterior stomach) and in the sixth, the mesoderm also arises, so the esophagus has its ventral muscularization and its dorsal muscular layer. After the closure of the median line of the esophagus, the mesoderm becomes another muscle layer. The injured process (esophageal atresia) is thought to originate from the intersection of eccentric lesions in the distal region of the esophagus due to the invasion into the mediastinal space of the fourth pharyngeal arch by tumor cells or the collapse of the artery. This injury is not realistic in the cephalon since there is already a previously developed S-shaped esophagus, but in this region, the normal fetus enforces the development of the esophagus up to its development. A cervical adenosacrum can bring the most frequent cervical manifestation of the phenomenon. The atresia may also occur due to"}

{"text": "Question: 53,What is the fastest way to reduce inflammation in the joints? \n ### Answer: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, can help to reduce inflammation and pain while slowing the progression of joint damage. Yes is the correct answer for this MCQ. An NSAID is the fastest way to reduce inflammation in the joints. NSAIDs are standard therapies to reduce inflammation due to the ability to inhibit inflammatory mediators that facilitate the pain, swelling, stiffness, and haemorrhage through their systemic action. They are supportive in emergencies to prevent bone and tissue destruction. As cox enzymes are vital in the regulation of prostaglandins and are easily suppressible with NSAIDs, therefore they can effectively reduce inflammation and pain. Nevertheless, corticosteroids are a controlled group of drugs for reducing pain and inflammation and NSAIDs may, however, be alternatives to them for some usages.

The patients and their diseases do not always followed the same life expectancy/predictions. That is why there are different survivors and non-survivors. in this discussion of Howe et al., the cohort of patients with PsA had different life expectancy, because of difference in severity, terminal condition, or having a good response from medications.The measure of central tendency that differs from average is median, where median is calculated by organizing all the data from low to high and finding the middle number.For example, there is a set of data: 2, 10, 20, 40, 48, 50, 55Average: 22Median: 20The calculation of average includes all data with some data sets being heavily weighted.

The prognosis of sporadic ataxia is poor. The Spinocerebellar atrophy (SCA) has been described as fatal genetically-induced neurodegenerative diseases. Due to underlying genetic heterogeneity, their clinical and longitudinal phenotypes vary tremendously. The prognosis is mainly dependent on disease subtype, age at onset, and severity of symptoms. The life expectancy of SCA patients varies from 6 to 20 years. The least severe subtypes (SCA7 and SCA13) have a life expectancy of more than 50 years, whereas subtypes 2, 3, 6, and 9 are usually lethal within 20 years of life, and the most severe subtypes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, and SCA7) can potentially lead to death within 10 years.

At present, hiccup patients were mostly treated with traditional medicine or rehabilitation training. This concept is primitive and has been constantly developing. Literature search: Celiac Disease May Be Another Cause of Intractable Hiccups, BMJ Case Reports, 2020, Vol. 12, P. e20210055..Not foundBlogs\uff1ahttps://cloud.huest.edu.cn/app/a/public/uploaded/hupo/34510ca401d4428fa45873f8a66672bd.pdfThe correlation between intractable hiccups and celiac disease is explored. This study analyzed literature on 651 patients with recurrent idiopathic hiccups, of which 70 were found to have met the diagnostic standard of celiac disease. Of these 70 patients, 46 reported relief of hiccup symptoms after diet. Central hiccup is rare but can cause severe complications, including death. The triggering mechanism is unclear, involving potentially medicated or psychological factors. The current treatments of idiopathic and symptomatic hiccups only provide short-term relief. In addition, treatment with Baclofen and Pentobarbital has been shown to be effective in some patients. In this paper, HUPOPOS is used to select candidate and active tradional Chinese medicine recipes for \u201cYing Ge Wan\u201d prescription of hiccups. It can be seen that understanding the causality of hiccups can effectively alleviate symptoms. The data also suggests that \"Ying Ge Wan\" in traditional Chinese medicine can alleviate the patient's physical severity and relieve tension."}

{"text": "Question: 38,What is the main cause of snoring? \n ### Answer: Snoring is normally caused by the way the tongue, soft palate, tonsils, and/or adenoids are situated inside the back of the throat. When the muscles supporting the tongue and throat are relaxed during sleep, the tongue and soft palate may slip to the back of the throat and obstruct the airway. This obstructed airway increases the pressure in the throat and results in the characteristic sounds of snoring. Other factors that can create a more narrow airway include a narrow nasal pass, enlarged adenoids and tonsils, deviated septum, misaligned jaw, and facial bone structure. Allergies, colds, and other illness may also cause snoring.

{"text": "Question: 44,What is the main cause of urticaria? \n ### Answer: Allergies are the most common cause of chronic urticaria\u2014a skin disease characterized by an allergic inflammation. Urticaria develops when the antigen-antibody complexes or other mediators that affect the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity induce degranulation of mastocytes, which leads to release of mediators\u2014histamine, serotonin and others which cause itchy blistering eruption. Besides allergy autoimmunologic and autoinflammation causes occur in some patients.In addition, chronic spontaneous urticaria not associated with allergy, infection, or another identifiable cause is defined as chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, more advanced diagnostics, including immunologic and genetic testing, have revealed the presence of weak-production IgE, viral, infectious-bacterial causes of chronic urticaria. Beside that is observed clinical and functional changes and coincidental disorders that may affect the pathogenesis and chronification of the process conducted to an increase in the number of inflammatory and immune-competent cells in the dermis and sometimes a little thickening perivascular fibre. Genetic testing revealed the occurrence of diseases associated with autoimmunity. A significant role in case of urticaria plays infections.12\u201314 Studies carried out on selected clinical groups of patients with renal disease, autoimmune disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, lupus erythematosus or osteoporosis showed that these patients also have urticaria.13 The mechanism in which most bacterial and viral antigens lead to the formation of IgE is not quite clear, it may be production of IgM for bacterial and viral antigens and production of IgE for specific allergens in the same antigen, and then sensitization of mast cells and skin basophils occurs, which leads to \u201cdirect\u201d activation of cells. Biopsy found that the skin\u2019s current infiltration of eosinophils is mediated by cysteinyl leukotrienes and physiological activity of eosinophilic granule proteins may stimulate mast cells to secret histamine.15 The cause of urticaria may be bacterial, viral, immunological,"}

Obesity refers to a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, which usually reflects an excess of about 10\u201315% of body weight. It can be treated through lifestyle changes, physical activity, behavioral changes, and nutritional therapy. If this is insufficient, drugs or devices such as gastric bands can be used [1, 2].Hyperprolinemia can be hepatic or metabolic. In hepatic hyperprolinemia, the liver is the culprit, whereas in metabolic hyperprolinemia, renal tubules are the cause. The mechanism for the development of hyperprolinemia is not clear. Risk factors for hyperprolinemia include liver or kidney diseases.32.Unsuccessful megakaryopoiesis?Yes or NoHyperprolinemia usually occurs due to decreased catabolism or increased production, and is very common and nonspecific. It is usually seen in patients with liver, heart, or lung disease, with no clear symptoms. The same variety of liver disease also can show the same hyperprolinemia level. On the other hand, decreased elimination or shortened half-life may be seen due to kidney excretion impairment. So, when we see a hyperprolinemia value in a small amount of blood test in the presence of liver function impairment, it means that we cannot trust that amount of blood and the hyperprolinemia value. In fact, the result may rise from a large proline pool.Hyperprolinemia can occur as a part of lysinuric-protein intolerance (LPI) syndrome or phenylketonuria due to hyperproline catabolism.Hyperprolinemia is useful to reflect liver diseases and hyperprolinemia in liver diseases is usually proportional to the severity of the disease. Thus, it is believed that hyperprolinemia can be used in the follow-up of liver diseases. This indicates that the patient"}

{"text": "Question: 72,What is the most common cause of dysphagia? \n ### Answer: Secondary to other diseasesDysphagia affects approximately 20% to 56% of the elderly . The prevalence of dysphagia in nursing homes is reported as 2 depending on country. Dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing. Dysphagia is a symptom with multifaceted causes and needs to be diagnosed by an otolaryngologist. From the etiologies, neurological disorders, trauma, head and neck tumors, and lacunar infarctions affecting the swallowing center are more common. With aging, the prevalence of primary esophageal diseases is also increasing; reflux disease, stricture, and esophageal tumors . The most common complication and sequela of dysphagia are aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition . In a 2020 review, Rajamanickam et Al. showed that the most common cause of dysphagia in geriatric individuals is age-related problems such as abolshy shoulder muscles, declining somatosensory abilities in the mouth, oxidative stress and immune status, disorders of the thyroid/ parathyroid gland, and impaired endocrine function, including insulin resistance .Adhering the answer to the questioned lesson, dysphagia usually refers to a decreased capacity in swallowing, which can affect the safety of swallowing assessments. Dysphagia is frequent not only among older people, but also in a variety of disorder-related conditions. Encephalopathy, neuromuscular disorders, cerebrovascular disorders, thymoma, and tumors of the head and neck, and much more can all trigger the emergence of dysphagia in people. On the other hand, muscular changes, including dysfunctions of the oropharynx and dysphagia to ineffective esophageal motility, can result from loss of muscle strength. The quality of life can considerably decline in individuals with dysphagia, and swallowing- and nutrition-related complications such as malnutrition. Pneumonia and chronic aspiration can also be responsible for death ."}

{"text": "Question: 82,What is the most common cause of septic shock? \n ### Answer: Gammon et al. (2017) evaluated .renal replacement therapy for critical care patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, or ARDS in conjunction with sepsis. The authors concluded that therapies such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and fluid treatment are ineffective and may worsen renal function. Chen et al. (2019) studied fluid resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock. The preliminary results indicate that fluid resuscitation might be harmful in these patients, particularly in septic shock. These two studies suggest that catecholamine is the first-line therapy before fluid resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock. As a result, patients\u2019 lactate levels can rise while renal blood flow and urine output can both remain normal. Therefore, the most common cause of septic shock is not necessarily renal insufficiency but rather the pathogenesis of septic shock is an acute rarefaction of the vasculature, especially in the microcirculation. Furthermore, a comparison of European and American culture regarding \u2018\u2019stiff upper lip\u2019\u2019 in the British population versus the declarative expressiveness in the American population might be helpful.

{"text": "Question: 22,What is the root cause of gender dysphoria? \n ### Answer: MD, J; 24; 98.2; 2 (2014) 45.Gender dysphoria (Box 7) refers to a condition in which people experience a marked incongruity between their innate biological sex and their experienced/expressed gender . Gender not aligning with assigned sex at birth in human beings falls along a wide spectrum. Most people experience the assigned sex at birth as congruent with their gender and thus, often do not experience themselves as particularly gendered. Other people experience disproportionate discomfort or distress as a result of the presumed mismatch between their experienced/expressed gender and their biological sex. People with gender dysphoria desire a body of one perceived/experienced gender while being assigned a perceived/experienced gender of a different sex at birth, the latter being the sex assigned at birth \u2013 the sex hormones, as well as the characteristics \u2013 such as continuous development \u2013 and surgical interventions that children of any given sex will go through from birth onwards. However, there is no consensus as to whether using the phrase \u2018gender dysphoria\u2019 will offend those who are not gender dysphoric. Certainly, there are no studies showing that resentment develops due to the issue of diagnosing gender dysphorics. Studies did show no emotion regulation skills of transgendered youth and as well as challenges in setting priorities for the therapeutic needs of such individuals make them susceptible to emotional instability, suicide attempts, and inconsistent decision-making. The gender needs happen to be varied and divisive. Since gender is a social construct construed by societal frameworks (that vary in time and place), \u201cgender\u201d cannot be reduced to a diagnosis. However, with the medicalization of gender, gender is identified with \u201ca personal identity or an individual quality of one\u2019s personality or physical features.\u201dOwning responsibility for one\u2019s identity or individual psychological insight ."}

{"text": "Question: 55,What is the treatment for an arterial thrombus? \n ### Answer: Treatment may vary according to the particular patient and lesion characteristics. Emergent procedural access should occur as soon as possible, but to prevent arterial rupture risk during any intervention, procedural access should be obtained under partner personnel and arterial flow must be maintained.Procedural access for the intervention can be initiated via either a transiliac or retrograde common femoral arterial approach with a sheath 7 French or larger. The intervention can be performed either by the original operator or under the supervision of an interventionalist with percutaneous expertise. Cannulation of this lesion submurally is extremely hazardous. The interventional strategy is typically to place the distal tip of a 9 French-90 cm men catheter at the level of the lesion. Multiple law-flow arteriograms should be done to most accurately define the lesion after endovascular access is achieved using strategies that best outline the lumen of the stenosis. The use of contrast-flooded arteriograms may be a safer method to decide on the strategy to follow for revascularization. A long catheter should reach the true lumen and clearly defines the intimal flap with opacification of the true and false lumen. In-short, the main principle is to reestablish a stable blood flow between true lumen and distal normal arteriesCross-linked and longitudinal section of a silicone stent ready to advance for elongation into a long stent before placement into the stenosis atheroscleroticFollowing the discussion on the cross-localization of carotid ultrasound, the interventional management of stenosis carotid relies predominantly on the choice between the use of two methods of treatment, the systematic placement of stent of the rupture of stentS and the surgical intervention. Another alternative is the embolization of ISR of recanalization of the stenosed artery. In the case of stenting therapies, the first case study report an endovascular treatment in a patient with restenosis carotid, which is preceded by a combination of catheter intima angioplasty and stent placement.

The purpose of this measurement is to determine the relative position of the head of the humerus with respect to the elbow joint in order to identify the nature of the symptoms and plan the appropriate treatment. 67,Describe the etiology of cubitus varus Bone.Cubitus varus can be congenital or acquired. Congenital cubitus varus is a developmental anomaly characterized by varus inclination of the distal humerus in relation to the ulna, resulting in cubitus valgus deformity at the elbow. Mode of inheritance is unknown. Acquired cubitus varus can be a result of traumatic dislocation of the elbow, chronic disuse, or destruction of the distal humeral coronoid process, resulting in uncoverting of the medial column of the distal humerus and varus instability. Patients with acquired cubitus varus present with limited or no restriction of movement in the elbow."}

Treatment is focused around reducing the swelling, preventing complications, and addressing any underlying causes.

{"text": "Question: 72,What is vitiligo caused by? \n ### Answer: Vitiligo is caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. It is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the pigment-producing cells in the skin.83,What is the treatment for vitiligo?There is no cure for vitiligo, but there are several treatment options available that can help manage the condition. These include topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, and depigmenting agents. In severe cases, systemic therapies such as oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and immunomodulatory agents may be used. It is important for individuals with vitiligo to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan.94,What is the prognosis of vitiligo?The prognosis of vitiligo depends on several factors, including the age of onset, the extent and location of the white patches, and the response to treatment. In general, vitiligo is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. The rate of repigmentation varies from person to person and can be unpredictable. Some people may experience spontaneous repigmentation without any treatment, while others may require long-term treatment to achieve repigmentation. In some cases, vitiligo may remain stable over time without any treatment. It is important for individuals with vitiligo to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan and to monitor the condition over time.105,What is the difference between vitiligo and albinism?Vitiligo and albinism are both conditions that can cause depigmentation of the skin, but they are different in several ways. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the pigment-producing cells in the skin, while albinism is a genetic condition that affects the production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Another difference is that vitiligo usually appears as well-defined patches of white skin in otherwise normally pigmented areas of the skin, while albinism affects the entire body and can cause the skin, hair, and eyes to have a pink or reddish hue. In addition, vitiligo can affect people of any race or ethnicity, while albinism is more common in certain racial and"}

{"text": "Question: 07,What motion sickness feels like? \n ### Answer: Some people report gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, stomach discomfort, and vomiting when they use various types of VR technology. You might have the ability to identify these symptoms.Therefore, others might end up having similar symptoms, but their sensations while using VR might vary.08,The surroundings are disorienting.People report similar responses when they are exposed to both real motion and simulated motion. Thus, some people report sensations such as stomach discomfort. It is, therefore, possible that some people\u2019s VR experiences might be difficult for them to fully understand and interpret.The existing display technology generates an image that appears to the viewer in the form of a two-dimensional picture, albeit with some mild depth perceptacles. As a result, in order to see a clear picture of what is going on in VR, their brain must analyze what they see and then create an image of the VR world.09,Risk factors.Studies indicate that there are some common risk factors associated with experiencing negative effects such as nausea and vomiting while using VR. These include a history of diseases, alcohol use, psychological stress, sex, anxiety, pregnancy and motion disorders.10,Dizziness.If you feel dizzy after using VR, you should stop using immediately and take a long rest. If these symptoms persist, we advise that you consult a health professional.During exposure to VR, transient decreases in heart rate and blood pressure are normal.

{"text": "Question: 08,What muscle gets injured in a hamstring strain? \n ### Answer: The hamstring is a group of muscles at the back of the thigh. The biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus make up two sections (or arms) of the hamstring: the long-head (BFLH) and short-head (ST). The hamstring muscles insert on the tendon of the gastrocnemius muscle (in-side) and the knee joint capsule . A hamstring injury, which accounts for about a quarter of all sports injuries, is regarded as one of the most prevalent muscle injuries in sport as well as the most common injury in soccer, tennis, table tennis and basketball. A hamstring strain occurs when muscle fibers tear, usually while the muscle is put to use in a contracted (shortened) position. While most hamstring injuries occur to the long head of the BFLH muscle, the short-upper arm and lower-semitendinosus muscles, as well as the lower-head biceps can also be injured. Hamstring injuries are caused by a variety of factors. Injuries to hamstring muscles are more common on the left leg than on the right (58% vs. 41%). The BFLH is damaged more frequently than the ST (84% compare to 16%) and more frequently in the muscle's middle than the proximal region (89% vs. 11%) . The hamstring injury also happens to the player while he is moving (sprinting or decelerating) throughout the match, rather than at the start or end of it. The most common form of injury to the hamstring is called a \u2018pull\u2019 or \u2018avulsion\u2019, in which individual muscle fibers or groups or muscle fibers stand to tear . These tears allow for the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression and development of fast muscle cells under stress to be explored. Primary features of the injury may include longitudinal rip involving some of muscle fiber or transversal/segmental abrasions . The debris from torn muscle fiber provides lymphocytes with a fine fragment that the cells investigate and engulf in an attempt to fix the problem . The determination of a strain of hamstring significance is critical. Classification of the injury is based on clinical characteristics, in almanac, anatomical location, and extent of damage . Grade 1 or a mild injury is marked by the pain of place origin, swelling"}

{"text": "Question: 13,What qualifies as anorexia nervosa? \n ### Answer: Why is the criteria important? Assessment in individuals with suspected AN can be challenging due to deteriorating physical health and often unreliable reporting by patients due to denial of the problem or Lack of recall, reporting bias etc. There is significant symptom overlap between AN and other EDs, and comorbidities are common. Also, one might argue that \u2018normal\u2019 constraints or bodily signals are temporarily disrupted in illness, so it is challenging to ascertain retrospectively a delineation between \u2018normal\u2019 and pathological eating and BMI ranges. One would expect that proposed instrument items would take this into account? and would encompass a working definition of AN within a lay (unlikely to be aware of DSM diagnosis) or clinical context? For example, when in stage of recovery or during inpatient weight gain/rehabilitation \u2018normal\u2019 aim is to gain weight of 500g/day, that will naturally be more than their normal intake and they will naturally be more concerned about changes in body shape and concerns over weight gain etc.In addition, I could not find \u2018assessment\u2019 in the study question anywhere?03103-Animuno-XI.pdf."}

{"text": "Question: 27,What social anxiety feels like? \n ### Answer: In order to make sure we are sharing similar ideas, anxiety could be described as a combination of physical (e.g. fast heartbeat, sweating) and psychological (e.g. worries, self-doubt) symptoms which are unreasonable in relation to the actual situation. Usually most of our anxieties are related to stress in our daily life or fears for possible future events (e.g. failure at test, neglecting to call back a friend). Anxiety differs from fear, the latter being more focused on upcoming physical challenges or situations appraised to pose significant harm, while anxiety can occur in anticipation of potentially risky social events, even among confident extroverts . Temporary anxiety is a reaction of our body\u2019s \u2018alarm system\u2019 (or sympathetic nervous system) to real or perceived threats as it puts us in a state of mobilization so that you may effectively protect yourself (e.g. your heart beating faster before a sporting event). Persistent, dysfunctional anxiety (e.g. about your physical appearance and not leaving your home) tends to cause more harm than good and negatively impacting performance . People who are socially anxious tend to exaggerate the threat of their social performance, since they are subjective of personal sensitivity (negative self-appraisals), usually interpret the situation more negatively than it really is (negative interpretation), and tend to react in a physical and psychological manner in an exaggerated way (negative behavioral reactions) .Our anxiety also involve several thoughts: (a) initial panic and feeling of humiliation, (b) wish to avoid a sensation as shameful as the one felt when the nerve attack occurs, (c) intense worry, with the fear of another attack while walking again, returning home however would be maybe the first objective of the walk, and finally (d) the shame"}

{"text": "Question: 45,What triggers compulsive behavior? \n ### Answer: Alarm-signaling theory behind behavioral addiction states that if behaviors are motivated by changing the external environment for personal gain, facing aversive stimuli can trigger the repetition of these behaviors. 96,106 Accordingly, reward-based and goal-oriented functions are overrepresented in GTON 11 to unconsciously alter the environment to avoid aversive or negative feelings associated with the recent behavioral omission. Besides the unconsciously affective or goal-oriented functions in GTON, we hypothetically highlight the effect of interactions with certain mental disorders associated with compulsive behavior on GTON. Existing canonical models of compulsive disorders suggest that the treatment effects reverse the impaired functions of the orbitofrontal cortex in the reward circuit and the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen in the goal-oriented circuit.118,119,120,121 As the most representative compulsive disorder, behavior due to OCD is under strong control by the goal-oriented circuit neural network, corresponding to strong GTON. Amey et al. illustrated that the increased functional connection between the orbitofrontal cortex and prefrontal, anterior cingulate, parietal, and temporal cortices during the symptom-free period and decreased connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and medial temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices at symptom relapse were mediated by the secondary avoidance process. In this case, we assume that the external environment is changed by the reward circuit to promote an inconsistent relationship between the surroundings as they manifest in feeling states and the person\u2019s purpose or goal. If changing the external environment does not alter the internal initiation consistently, then we have the following feedback from the environment: Homeostatic functions result in the consequences becoming the same, and thus, it fits expectation and maintains behavior in the compulsive-impulsive cycle. However, the above positive feedback also results in delayed changes in life behavior; the longer the delay, the more pronounced the automaticity of behavior."}

{"text": "Question: 47,What triggers herpes genital? \n ### Answer: How long does it last? Isn\u2019t herpes recursion very similar to B in HIV? If yes, how are they different?50Answer: Just like HIV, HPV has an acute stage. When the virus invades the host and enters the lymph nodes, it contains a large amount of viruses and has acute manifestations such as local malaise in the genital area, lymph node enlargement, fever, and itching. The acute stage usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks after infection, and the clinical symptoms gradually improve and disappear within a period of about 1 to 2 weeks. After infection, the infection has entered the latent stage, and HPV enters an inactive or low virulence state. When the patient\u2019s immune system control is weakened, it will resume multiplication. It may be possible to get recurrent infection. During the recurrence, the virus load is close to that of acquired hypersensitivity after the initial infection. It is suggested that HPV-related disease should be treated comprehensively, including changing high-risk behavior, strengthening immune function, improving local vaginal flora, and practicing antiviral therapy according to the medicines mentioned above.Question: Does the straightforward identification of the alternate medicine mentioned above affect the quality of the article, or is it permissible to mention other, more included medications in the discussion?"}

The signature lesions of hidradenitis suppurativa, called \u2044 or by the termed \u201ctunneling sinuses,\u201d are draining sinuses that extend within subcutaneous tissue, integrating the subcutis.

{"text": "Question: 49,What triggers hyperacusis? \n ### Answer: Several physical and psychosocial factors can cause hyperacusis,87 resulting in highly heterogeneous and personal pain thresholds.33 Auditory and vestibular dysfunction is more common in people with hyperacusis than in control groups. Hearing loss may be associated with hyperacusis or may predispose a person to hyperacusis by altering central auditory processing or causing distress due to the perceived distortion of sounds.57,75,87 However, the exact mechanism of hyperacusis remains uncertain.L57\u2013L62According to the \u201cthreshold theory,\u201d acoustic stimulation at levels above perceived tolerance levels (a professional in-clinic measurement denotes a loudness discomfort level [LDL]) will trigger pain or unpleasantness.L62\u2013L64An important reason for this uncertainty may be the lack of a clear definition of hyperacusis and the difference between the perception of loudness and the perception of pleasantness or unpleasantness. Hyperacusis and misophonia have different definitions, which complicates diagnoses and the development of treatment guidelines.

The normal tear film will disappear first, then the caseum will discharge a white, transparent secretion. If a yellowish white secretion or thin yellowish white film appears on the conjunctival sac on one side or both sides of the eyelids, two circles will form like glasses, the visual acuity will decrease, a very thin mucus membrane will peel off, and the eyeball may be seriously damaged. If the yellowish white secretion unites above the eyelid, it will form white dots and string-like secretions, with yellow bubbles occurring on the surface, which will further coagulate to form a film to cover the eye surface, eventually invading the eyeball and damaging it seriously.Paying more attention to the ongoing situation of the sufferer will reduce further harm.Teaching objectives: Understanding the onset of diseases and the purpose of consulting a doctor.Secondary outcomes: so that the students can understand eye diseases occurring in school-age children, the medical attention they need, and related medical preservation knowledge, so that they can help to take care of their health.Content: Understanding the causes of watery eyes and types of diseasesPrevention and first aid measuresCompile health education cards"}

(2015) state that the 2014 Ebola epidemic is one of the deadliest and widespread human outbreaks in West Africa, and that the first case was reported in December 2013. In February 2014, a patient died in a hospital in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou in southeastern Guinea. In April 2014, the patient was tested positive for the Ebola virus. 55 The causes of this outbreak are still unknown; it may have been caused by a wild animal, although there are some who think it is a biological weapon."}

Surgical therapy and myotomy result in symptom improvement in about 87 %, with median raw score decreasing from 33 to about 10 after surgery. Pharmacological therapy appears to be a reasonable initial approach or adjunct to surgical therapy for adult LESA, and unlikely to have adverse effects.

{"text": "Question: 66,Which type of liver disease is most common in alcoholics? \n ### Answer: Significant liver disease accompanies the chronic consumption of alcohol in 5\u201310% of Western world drinkers, but the condition is most common among Native Americans (Cowley et al., 1992). Alcohol-induced liver disease encompasses a full spectrum of liver disorders, including fatty liver, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and alcoholic hepatitis (Frank et al., 1990; Stockinger et al., 2003). For FLD, loss of liver weight is used to distinguish alcohol-induced fatty liver from NAFLD (Day et al., 2019). Arising quickly on chronically abused alcohol (~30 years) (Frank et al., 1990; Stockinger et al., 2003), alcoholic cirrhosis is characterized by parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis (Sun and Liberti, 1980; Stockinger et al., 2003). Risk and prognosis of FLD/steatohepatitis and cirrhosis may differ in patients with supernormal or non-supernormal drinking patterns (Miyaki et al., 1986; Rehm et al., 2009; Day et al., 2019). In alcohol-induced cirrhosis, the hard deposition of retained toxins, lipids, and iron within hepatocytes and the non-parenchymal tissue affects liver blood flow, whereas in NAFLD, adipose infiltration of hepatocytes is associated with decreased intracellular antioxidant protection, parenchymal edema, and the scaled loss of NAD and antioxidants such as glutathione (Figure 3)."}

{"text": "Question: 87,Why am I suddenly stumbling over my words? \n ### Answer: Why can\u2019t I think of the right one? What is going on? On top of the usual cognitive load and a strong feeling of stress as I try to give a good presentation, all these questions are going through my head.It would be very nice if you could filter out the noise of cognitive load and stress such that the neural oscillations of thinking would be better passed to another person (either another brain or simply an outside computer trying to read my brain waves). If this noise could be filtered out, a \u201ccleaner\u201d opportunity for communication between brains could be established, and it may be easier to understand another person.88 Finally, Cohen Edair has explored whether priming a mindset of interdependence between participants could increase the sensitivity of the participants to input from partners in a co-creative task . Here the goal was to see how the presence of a mindset of interdependence during the task would influence social relationship judgments, which could in turn influence the activat-ion of mirror neurons. In a preliminary finding, Cohen Edair found participants who expressed more independence mindsets also expressed less of a mindset of interdependence or dependence. This suggests that mindset manipulations were achieved. Further, cooperative behavior groups increased when participants were asked to focus on a mindset of interdependence before a co-creative task, but only when participants had not already expressed a mindset of interdependence prior to cooperation. This may suggest that mindset state influences behavior. Additionally, Cohen Edair found that the relative level of mindset of interdependence was positively relational to the level of similarity of relationships found between participants of a newly co-created game, such as if they thought their partner was more of a competitor or friend (note that this similarity variable was found to also be important in who is chosen to be a partner for the co-creative task). More research is necessary to derive causal relationships among mindsets and outcomes of behavior during cooperative tasks. Still, this work shows how mindsets do interact with one\u2019s beliefs and feelings and do influence actions like cooperation (refer to Fig. 1 for a visualization of main findings of mindset studies described in this section).Fig. 1The current state of mindset research across several artifacts, shown diagrammatically, along with key concrete findings in the different domains.

In such cases the best prevention is to have a very good liver because if your liver is not healthy you will have serious problems.

{"text": "Question: 14,Why do periods hurt so much on the first day? \n ### Answer: You need to explain why this is in terms of genital biology rather than \u2018vanilla\u2019 simulations. I believe that a basic explanation is that it takes some time for the cervix string (entrance to the uterus) to relax, allowing the uterine lining inside to slide out. Pain is experienced in the pelvis as the lining is pulled back, and it hurts because it\u2019s like you\u2019re tearing up a tissue inside with the tissue paper (sorry!). After the first initial slippage, it tends to not be as bad because more of the tissue just slides out. I develop this in further detail here. I believe this is where some game designers have got it wrong. Usually in puzzlers, you\u2019re time-limited from the time it begins to the time it ends (e.g., that time-limited ticking down until period cramps start). However, in this context, as I explain in thatuffs (Or Current Contents [CCj], paragraph 4), the period hurts more and more slowly before later speeding up."}

Response by author: The author apologises for not defining the term diabetes insipidus in the introductory section. He wishes to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The following sentence has been added to the introductory section on hypernatremia in order to define diabetes insipidus: Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder resulting from hypofunction of the neurohypophysis resulting in the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine (Lanini et al. 1999). The cause of hypofunction of the neurohypophysis could be either an inadequate production of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) as a result of a disease of the hypothalamus and pituitary, or could be excessive secretion of the ADH as a result of a non-secreting pituitary adenoma (Lanini et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2010)."}

It has been argued by a pilot study \u2013 in all participants who subsequently applied for a post in the military \u2013 that flat feet are over-represented in potential recruits. Diversity implies the inclusion of people of different backgrounds, and ethnicity is the most visible indicator of background differences .

{"text": "Question: 36,Why is my period late if I\\'m not pregnant? \n ### Answer: My friend told me that if your period has been longer than it usually is and you feel nauseated, you may be pregnant. Your period can be later than normal for many reasons. For instance, you might have a heavy flow, or you might have a lighter flow or spotting instead of a regular period. Or you might be stressed. A mindset of possibilities is important to avoid creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you are experiencing a long period, try these suggestions. If your period is heavier or lighter than usual, drink plenty of water. I know this can be hard if you have other symptoms like bloating, but water is a natural diuretic that can ease your body\u2019s burden and help move things forward. Get plenty of rest, both physical and mental. Talk to yourself about the fact that you are having a normal bodily function. Treat your period the way you would treat a friend who was concerned about her period being irregular. Be gentle with yourself Keep a record of when your period comes and why and for how long.

{"text": "Question: 41,Why is period pain so painful? \n ### Answer: It is not just that women have neuronal sensitisation producing hyperalgesia, but there are also non-neuronal mechanisms involved in the production of pain. Pain is not only triggered from endometrial tissue distortion produced by menstruation or ovulation, but incorporates visceral organ reflexes. These are derived predominantly from the pelvic viscera and are generalised to involve the peritoneum, pelvic muscles and/or pelvic floor muscles. These pain patterns are often superimposed on primary period pain and relate to over tension in such pelvic structures. It is worth considering the tension states of the pelvic floor muscles and visceral organs in women presenting with period pain. Tight pelvic floor muscles are also differentially related to headache, especially migraine [33\u2022]."}

The self-healing process can take between four weeks and six months , as spinal inflammation resulting from the protrusion will begin to subside. The pressure on desired nerve areas reduces as well as the pain sensation disappears. This self-healing process occurs in approximately 40% of cases .

{"text": "Question: 56,Will a toothache go away on its own? \n ### Answer: -Yes, some toothaches are caused by red or sore gums caused by plaque. If you improve your oral hygiene and it begins to heal we don't need to worry about it or consult a professional.Needs improvements-I don\u2019t think if it\u2019s due to red gums, as they are hard to resolve so the toothache is likely to last for a while. We really need to see a professional about that.82,Will decreasing food a lot help with toothache?-Hunger is bad for our teeth and it\u2019s better to have an occasional cane or something in between your meals than eating a lot at once and giving it time to recover.Needs improvements-We can\u2019t decrease all the food we eat and the toothache won\u2019t go away easily if we keep eating a lot at once so this statement is kind of contradictory.95,Could I get paid for regularly changing my toothbrush?-If you regularly change your toothbrush so that the bristles are clean and don\u2019t carry old food on them then you are preventing the accumulation of food debris and plaque on your teeth. Keeping your family and teeth clean without having to change your toothbrush every time you brush your teeth will save you a lot of money in the long run.Needs improvements-For real? I don\u2019t think this is really backed up by any research and the authors are here unrealistically encouraging people to continue using one toothbrush forever.43,Some parts of the article talk about problems of concentrations and using too much toothpaste and brushing too furiously which can cause acid erosion.

We focus all our research and translation efforts on developing treatments, therapies, and cures. Please review the answers to questions 2\u20134 regarding our specific strategies and projects to achieve this goal.71,Does CMT affect mental function?No, CMT does not appear to cause mental health issues. In fact, only a few percent of CMT patients exhibit mild depression, while others achieve the same goals, obtain the same career successes, and raise the same families as most people.71,Are there other types of CMT?Yes. CMT is classified as CMT1, CMT2, DM1, and DM2. These separate conditions are the result of differences in the genetic cause of the disease, but all cause similar muscle weakness and involvement of heart, lungs, and central nervous system.81,Will CMT cause death?Yes. CMT is considered a slowly progressive lethal disease. While survival is highly variable, it is generally in the range of 30 years for CMT1 and up to 75 years for some CMT2 cases. The severity of CMT in CMT2 is considered relatively consistent regardless of the CMT2-causing gene involved, whereas CMT1 is considered highly variable in severity even within families affected by the same CMT1-causing gene.91,What are the current therapeutic approaches to preventing CMT?We are developing several CMT drug treatments addressing molecularly distinct pathogenic mechanisms associated with this disease (Table 2). These drugs target CMT1 and CMT2 and can be used alone, in combination, or in conjunction with anti-sense oligonucleotides.1"}

Emerging evidence from studies in late 2020 show that coronavirus RNA persists in some lingering symptoms (e.g depression, fatigue) affecting the individuals for up to 12 weeks after symptoms onset. However, this RNA is rarely or not present in individuals who do not develop symptoms during the acute phase of illness. A study in healthy individuals by Xu et al . showed that no live virus (cell-cultured test) could be isolated from swab samples of seronegative healthy individuals. Although the RNA is still present, the infectiousness of the person carries over to the community.No \u2013 Self-explaining."}
{"text": "Question: Would viral last more than two weeks? \n ### Answer: Most people did not feel the need to slough skin much longer than two weeks after onset of susceptibility.

I realize this is speculative, but it is a possibility worth discussing and suggests that longer continuous existence of excreting virus in the skin should be a risk factor for infection transmission."}
{"text": "Question: Will the cyst do away or will it burst? \n ### Answer: This is the question raised in the treatment of ovarian cysts. In the USA, more than 250, 000 ovarian cystectomies are performed yearly that could be avoided by applying the medical treatment. The ideal therapy for a disturbing symptomatic ovarian cyst is rapid deflation of the cyst. However, before choosing the therapeutic plan, it is important and imperative to establish the ovarian cyst diagnosis with accurate imaging techniques. Currently, there is a consensus between specialists on using the imaging methods for diagnosis of WHO stage I as well as II cysts.

{"text": "Question: Is it possible to get antibiotics? \n ### Answer: Can the lack of oxygen or of nutrients be solved by the application of modern imaging? Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 demonstrate the hasty formation of larger necrotic regions, which impairs viability. Moreover, it generates an oxygen and glucose depleted environment, which permits bacterial proliferation. This yields surface formation, where the pathogens can, once more, adhere to the heart surface. Translating these three key events to three different areas, the tumor, the wound and hematogenous spread, cancer is once more comparable to the effect of sepsis. First, while a tumor grows in size, the solid tumor, as opposed to the liquid part of the human body, remains relatively hypoxic . The process of hypoxia, while very similar (loss of oxygen), is distinguished by different means to achieve it . Second, apart from the difference in inflicted infection site, a longer period of time is needed to trigger hypoxic effects ."}

{"text": "Question: What do you think is causing this allergic reaction? \n ### Answer: Most patients with allergic reactions associate food exposure with food allergy. Although past exposure to ingested wheat does not always provoke an IgE-mediated reaction, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) has been associated with exercise following exposure to wheat . FDEIA is a form of food-dependent anaphylaxis, which has been defined as an exercise-induced IgE-mediated reaction that occurs reproducibly after ingestion of a specific food . Studies have also reported that wheat also elicits atopic eczema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis . Wheat allergy may present in atopic patients with both gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement . Furthermore, occupationally provoked wheat allergy may resemble occupational asthma or chronic baker\u2019s lung . Clinicians should ask questions to identify patient\u2019s allergic triggers that include what they have ingested, what time of the day it occurred, and what was going on (e.g. exercise, occupational exposures, or medications). Some medications may increase wheat allergy or other food reactions, such as alpha-adrenergic blocking agents or antihistamines . Accordingly, this patient had wheat allergy associated with exercise (wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis; WD-EIA). Wheat-dependent, food-dependent atopic dermatitis, wheat-dependent, food-dependent urticaria, and wheat and/or aniseed sensitivity as manifestations of wheat allergy have also been described in the literature ."}

{"text": "Question: How long until the amox starts to reduce the infection/pain? \n ### Answer: Say, to one tenth of maximum. Or one third. Every third day, take amox for 3 weeks, and then stop. By the 6th day, the pain is gone. And amox kept doing its job after stopping. That might be a more normal way to think about this stuff. I think too often we get this one drug and we manage to make it the \u201cI rode in on White Knight to save the day\u201d drug. Even the one third, me too. Just re just taking the drug, it reduces the pain. Given that all this is well correlated, it might be good to get a working definition of a drug with an \u201canti-IQN\u201d to goal. With the goal, you need something that plots well. Perhaps normalizations would help.

{"text": "Question: Okay is irritation of the nerve treatable or permanent damage? \n ### Answer: If permanent, the patient should be aware of it, otherwise the speech stimuli would not be durable, which defeats the purpose. Or is this a \u201cnormal reaction\u201d then and can be overcome in time? Is it regional or does the irritation affect all channels or even more specifically regions? With this information you could adequately answer the question above. On the other hand, do these stimuli increase the irritation of the nerve? The electric stimulation should be conducted under certain symptoms, such as pain or changes of sensation spheres, but otherwise should by carefully monitored/guided. Since you describe a case of many changes to the nerve, such as stimulation changes (stimulation intent, pulse, pulse width, etc.) could have possibly led to permanent damage."}

The decision to prescribe antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis is not always straightforward.

(Int 6)Individuals may have suggested differing causes of specific whereas their HPs could link them to a common stressor. For example, low mood and fatigue are familiar symptoms to a person with MS, but their presentation may lead individuals to conclude their effects are exhaustion, loss of bone density or an upset stomach, which are only indirectly linked to MS in experiential terms (Table 4).The overarching theme is of a disparate and confusing repertoire of symptoms and problems described by individuals, attributing them to highly specific causes or varied more general issues, experimental evidence of a connection to MS and the experience of an HP to causal connections arising from a common source. There is a very mixed experience of how MS-related symptoms, problems and losses may be viewed, understood and communicated. Three main subthemes are described in relation to HPs' communication with individuals."}

Within steroid usage, dexamethasone is far more potent than MPS derivatives (methylprednisolone or prednisone), proven by Schmitt and colleagues; this means that other MPS derivatives (prednisone or meprednisolone) will also not have the same effect on the expression of IL-6/TNF\u03b1. The question of steroids in COVID-19, and especially in the early phase of viral replication and cytokine biosynthesis, has not been sufficiently investigated and requires further research, and thus, the question is still open."}

{"text": "Question: Can i replace Naproxen by paracetamol? \n ### Answer: Studies suggest that any significant antipyretic effect of paracetamol is lost by 4 hours after oral or rectal administration. As naproxen also requires 4\u20135 hours for peak effect, concurrent administration of paracetamol and naproxen will have additional benefit, but the answer is not this simple as there are significant pharmacological differences between paracetamol and naproxen in relation to their site of action, and thus their antipyretic effect. Paracetamol lowers pyrogenic cytokine production and acts as a centrally mediated antipyretic drug. Naproxen on the other hand, is a centrally acting antipyretic drug and a peripherally acting cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. The interactions between paracetamol and naproxen are poorly studied and there is only little information regarding this issue. The architecture of the molecules and resultant physical and pharmacological properties of these drugs imply that there may be an interaction, but that has not been proved scientifically. Until further research provides us with convincing results it is better to refrain from combining paracetamol with naproxen, simply because it is of no use."}

{"text": "Question: Does Effexor cause weight gain? \n ### Answer: (Response) I found some discrepancies between the response and information in the text cited as the source. It is unclear whether the weight gain cited by the authors (3.4 lbs) refers to weight gain in women or men or the entire population of patients in the study. Furthermore, if the patients were weighed in their clothes and the numbers reported represent weight in lbs, then one would expect an even greater weight gain among the patients in the study (For instance, a patient who reported 17.5 pounds weight gain, per the NDC census, would have an additional pound of weight gain if they had been weighed without their clothes.). Also, one has to wonder about the effectiveness of treatment in those patients that experienced no change in weight because their previous treatment strategy was reported as having failed. It seems reasonable that the treatment course would be more effective in those patients. In fact, there is another article (this one exploring antidepressant use and weight) and this paper and the text cited (a paragraph from a longer article) refer to a 9.8 lbs gain in a population of women and men experiencing antidepressant treatment in an uncontrolled situation. Although the answers to my questions are not directly addressed in the cited published article (a 2005 archival issue of the NEJM), the issues I have raised are important ones given the implications for the health of both male and female patients and should not be overlooked in any large data analyses. I also found it interesting that the authors reported the weight gain numbers for Roxy as a single finding but then reported the weight gain with Effexor as a combined number for the XR and IR formulations. Finally, the immediate weight gain and loss mentioned by the authors referred to the time after initiation of the course of treatment or shortly after the time the patient was started on the antidepressant. Does that capture only the short-term weight change or the long-term weight change? It seems to be the short-term but if one deciphers the references the references refer to longer-term use."}

{"text": "Question: Can I continue to take Sudafed with the antibiotics? \n ### Answer: This is an important question not only for the patient but also for the public health system.

Nevertheless, they continue treating themselves with Sudafed, not realizing the potentially deleterious consequences of noncompliance. In another case, the physician may want to ensure that antibiotic therapy is effective, and thereby specifically prescribes research of the safety of Sudafed usage together with the antibiotic."}

{"text": "Question: Do I need an antibiotic? \n ### Answer: Is this symptom of my asthma? The aetiology present in this study assured the presence of pathogenic agents unproductive to asthmatics. Any other aetiology that will infect patients with asthma will yield a different pattern and subsequently produce systemic complications, especially when this infection will not be taken care of promptly. The Alcian blue stain done is a clinical method done in diagnosing respiratory epithelial cells and mucin. From samples taken from patients with asthma, there is a decrease in the size and the number of goblet cells that are adequate in normal samples. This can significantly change the consistency of the airway mucous secretion . It may, therefore, give rise to dysfunctional mucous secretions, causing asthma and a preceding condition such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pneumoniae or inflammation of the intrinsic airways or disease of the pulmonary vasculature which may lead to ventilation and perfusion mismatching and end-organ dysfunction (pulmonary hypertension) thus causing asthma or the disease itself, managing asthma, as well as not treating this condition or creating an unabiding environment for other pathogens to colonise in . This inspection of goblet cells assessment may become more important as the basis for controlling asthma becomes addressed."}

There was no significant difference in the outcomes of treatment of antral and claiming scars. Evidence for the broad application of Aeolus PF is currently lacking. Despite this, an aqueous aluminum sulfate solution with 5% zinc oxide has been widely used to treat acne scars on the face. This study suggests that Aeolus PF is also effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stiff scars. High treatment rates show that the application of Aeolus PF can bring satisfactory as well as economic and practical benefits to patients with post-traumatic scars on the face, ears and scalp."}

My pancreas did not appear to be gall bladder related, I cannot even see my gall bladder. I did get a CT scan before my gallbladder was removed and found nothing, so maybe that is the cause.

I ask because usually the nausea can come from the benadryl and it could have been a side effect of taking both meds together. Otherwise, a benzo withdrawal symptom. 3) I totally can appreciate the placebo response. Some patients have a genetic variant that makes them more prone to this response. That being said, cannabis has strong psychophysiological effects (meaning mostly done through the brain and it\u2019s connections which isn\u2019t equivalent to a placebo effect) which while being more potent is also more likely to trigger a withdrawal response in this case.

{"text": "Question: What is the numbing gel? \n ### Answer: Numbing gel is usually used to relieve pain, sometimes in combination with a local anesthetic, used as an ointment or spray to relieve pain from hemorrhoids, anal fissures, minor burns, or other skin irritations, and also used to relieve pain during medical procedures.10 Lidocaine gel is one of the varieties of numbing gels, which is a local anesthetic. Lidocaine is an amide-derived local anesthetic that commonly acts via a voltage-gated sodium channel blockade, which prevents the generation and propagation of the neural action potential. It exhibits a duration of action significantly longer than that of cocaine17 Cocaine usually remains effective for 1to 30 minutes11,12 and its action starts after 10 to 15 minutes, it has the shortest local action time as compared to other types of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine and lidocaine. But orthodontic tooth movement starts weeks after force is applied, this obviously had the lower thermal pinpoint as the primary intraoral stimulus for pain sensation; on the other hand, Bitche warmed intraoral pinprick higher thermal threshold raises the primary stimulus for pain sensation.11,13 Regarding acute pain, the maximum score of pain intensity was initially observed 1 hour after activating forces and an increase in pain was persistent for 3 days, followed by a plateau phase up to 1 month. Therefore, the local anesthetic effect may be important only for the first 24 hours after force activation and beyond that, the analgesic effect of lidocaine masked by ongoing orthodontic tooth movement.13 Previous studies on painful effects of orthodontic tooth movement using force strawberry had shown that it was painful for the first 24 to 48 hours after applying the force but painDuration was adjusted in agreement with forces applied and the area of occlusion.14 Various studies had shown that acute pain during the initial and early phases of orthodontic tooth movement is common and the use of local anesthetics is confounded by analgesia, although the liquid in the end and holding resins used by many patients may help reduce pain.14 Although techniques such as oral sedation are suggested for neuropathic pain which is more"}

{"text": "Question: Can a sinus infection be caused by bad allergies? \n ### Answer: When an individual has allergies, it is common for them to also experience a stuffy or runny nose. The decongestants and antihistamines used to treat these symptoms can often contribute to a condition called rhinitis medicamentosa, meaning that the nasal passages are constantly swollen due to overuse of medications. Since the nasal passages are a part of the sinuses, chronic swelling and inflammation can interfere with proper drainage of the sinuses. This condition can cause some discomfort in the sinus area, often similar to sinus pressure in individuals with a respiratory infection. However, rhinitis medicamentosa is often misdiagnosed as sinusitis due to the chronic, uncomfortable nature of the condition . Additionally, seasonal allergies can often mimic an acute infection due to initial inflammation of the sinus passages. However, with seasonal allergies, that inflammation will often resolve as the allergies get better over time."}

This antiviral activity has been demonstrated in culture and in a few small case series . Cyclosporine, which is used to treat graft-versus-host diseases, was shown good activity against CMV  but no reports were found for DHAV-1 and FHAV-4 related infections. Another approach could be to block the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway given that it mediates the inflammatory response in DHAV-1 infection . Alternatively, a repurposed molecule available to the veterinary profession could be used; one logical example would be recombinant IFN-\u03b1."}

Anxiety and panic can be the cause of depressive symptoms, or depression can lead to anxiety and panic attacks, or both can occur simultaneously (8). True panic disorder is commonly associated with other anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) (9).

However, we found occasional cell death inherent in the sick cultures, which correlated well with the appearance of nuclear material in the media over the course of our experiments. This observation suggests that there may be other phenotypic characteristics for the sick cells or, perhaps alternatively, the NMDA receptor is needed for aspects of bacterial physiology other than metabolic activity. Further experiments will be required to characterize the relationship between NMDA receptor and benzonatate sensitivity, and to more thoroughly explore the mechanisms for the growth arrest/death phenotype and the specific role of NMDA receptor activity in these processes."}

The infiltrate, measured with a pleural effusion, was exceeding the infiltration level that could be explained with an unilateral pneumonic infiltration. A fibrebronchoscopy with a broncho-alveolar lavage could have been a relay on the right lane and would have been a special option, also a search for intra pleural specimen could have been valuable, but this procedure is not part of our therapeutical standards. The setting up from this maneuver was possible, however due to patient's problems and expected uncomfortable procedure the likelihood to set up this routinely was low.

Many attempts have been made to identify the cause of acute pink eye, but few have succeeded.1,3 Some eye drops labeled as ocular or ophthalmic antipruritic may be used during an outbreak to help alleviate symptoms and reduce virus transmission, such as artificial or sterile tears with or without antihistamine, or eye drops for dry eye or allergies.

{"text": "Question: something to relieve the pain? \n ### Answer: \u2019 Once individuals state that they have a pain at a certain anatomical site, they usually request medication (remedy) for the pain or a diagnostic procedure to remove it (e.g., \u2018A pain killer or cortisone\u2019; p. 20). If, however, individuals do not have the opportunity to receive a treatment, they will report less radiating, higher intensity, and higher prevalence of pain in the affected body part (Bilgin-Ozkan et al., 2010). This \u2018treatment-no-treatment\u2019 impact on pain experience has been labelled nocebo effect and is defined according to Mazur et al. (2004) as pain in the absence of noxious stimulation, that is brought on byColors have different cultural meanings. Pain is frequently correlated with negative colours, such as dark red, burgundy, or black. The difference in selection of certain colours between cultures suggests that people also associate different phenomena with certain colours. Depending on what languages people speak, the concept of corporal suffering seems to be related to colors of different quality. (p. 76).four colours: blue, red, yellow, and brown (Mazur et al., 2004).Nevertheless, pain reporting might not only be an effect of culture-specific expectations or beliefs; the linguistic encoding of pain, or the concepts which languages offer for the description of sensations might also impact the pain experience (S\u00e1nchez-Ardila and Segovia-Mullor, 2010). People\u2019s concepts of feelings and sensations are constructed and communicated with the aid of a symbolic system, the language. Moreover, people use language both to explore and to experience their feelings. The same idea can be expressed in different linguistic forms; but the choice of a given linguistic form may change the nature of the experience. In other words, language use is actively shaping lived experiences and feelings, instead of merely reporting them (Bruner, 1990, p. 67). In this context, the linguistic encoding of pain is crucial because it shapes and modifies the pain experience. Pain, in the sense of acute suffering, is experienced as an acute exacerbation of a chronic disease, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, while in other cases, chronic pain develops after a primary"}

{"text": "Question: So should I take ibuprofen when I start feeling the headache coming on? \n ### Answer: Is that over the counter medication (OT)? If you answer affirmatively, I would ask \u201cWhat is the brand name of the medication you usually take?\u201d and \u201cHow many did your doctor prescribe to you?\u201d If the response is that the medication is not usually taken over the counter, I would ask \u201cTaking into account that a PEx/AE could start differently, what would you do if you\u2019re away from your home?\u201d Maybe you could then think about asking why/what the choice of the brand is in relation to cost. For the dose, it is well known that dose variation is wildly known for pain medication especially acetaminophen (eg, 500\u2013650\u20131000 mg vs 650 mg\u20131000 mg). If the patient is not used to taking otcs for pain, I would ask \u201cHave you taken an otc medication for your head or migraine before\u201d. Then if \u201cyes\u201d, ask what \u201chave you taken before?\u201d.

{"text": "Question: Is there anything with lidocaine that would be appropriate? \n ### Answer: Is this likely to cause a QTc? There very well may be some effect [as it blocks all cardiac sodium channels], but it may not be a real big concern. You know, it depends on the time of administration. If you\u2019re talking about around the time of a CMR scan, I\u2019m less sure that this is going to be that concerning from the standpoint of potentially exacerbating a long QT. I do think lidocaine would be OK for fascial block and other extra cardiac blocks. However, you\u2019re going to see multiple different practitioners in [the] MRI environment and you may not have that choice of injection site. That would be my first concern, blocked cardiac sodium channels are probably not the best choice.[13-24 h post-scan]I guess if they\u2019re going to do [the block at the] scanner room, and it has to be in that timeframe, then I wouldn\u2019t put lidocaine up there. Maybe bupivacaine\u2026 then probably go with an agent that has a shorter half-life if they\u2019re going to stay there beyond the half-life of the agent.[Post-scan]Lesperguer: What I've also found helpful is to use ultrasound to see where the injection needle is located [in relation to] the fascial plane. So, I\u2019ll give you an example: down towards the distal portions [of back], especially to the obturator nerve. It is lateral towards the nerve. Put the needle towards the lateral side\u2026 you\u2019ll feel a pop and then when you refloat the needle you\u2019ll hear the flow and then you can inject. Than afterwards you can use your ultrasound again to verify that you\u2019re in the interfascial plane. You\u2019ll still have a pop and then you can verify that you injected laterally to the fascial plane. That\u2019s something I learned to do afterwards [in order] to block the intercostal nerves. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time since without ultrasound guidance, but ultrasound guidance helps as a check, so I guess I adopted that practice. The main thing is not to inject deep into the muscle because if the muscle twitches it\u2019s much more uncomfortable for the patient.Prep: Traditionally echo guidance is preferred if available [over palpation], but pal"}

{"text": "Question: I've never had a yeast infection before and then have two in consecutive months - should I be worried? \n ### Answer: This is a very good question, and we're glad you asked. While yeast infections are a common cause of vaginal symptoms, two in a row could be a sign of something more serious. There could be an underlying condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes or pregnancy, that is contributing to the development of yeast infections. Additionally, multiple yeast infections within a short period of time could be a sign of antibiotic resistance, which is becoming a increasing public health concern. If you have been prescribed antibiotics recently and are experiencing recurrent infections, it's important to talk to your doctor or a healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may be able to recommend alternative treatment options or adjust your current medication. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult a healthcare provider for guidance on your specific situation. They can help you manage your symptoms and prevent future infections."}

It follows that substituting the placebo by a TumsR antacid (Cal citrate-O-Calcium carbonate-Magnesium hydroxide) will result in the same thing. Thus, the result would be the same whether or not the patient were on Pepto-B. Yet, we expected changes in reported symptoms with treatment with our bio-feedback device compared to before treatment.

AIT is a treatment that consists of the administration of gradually increasing doses of the allergen to which the patient is allergic. This treatment is based on the concept of immunologic tolerance, which is the inability of the immune system to respond to a specific antigen.

{"text": "Question: what other stds would cause this if not gonorrhea or chlamydia? \n ### Answer: Its syphilis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis are other STDs associated with cervicitis. The risk of trichomoniasis is higher among women than men. Cervicitis is the female gynecological disease that is most often related to sexually transmitted infections. Still, several other pathological factors, such as vaginal douching, sperm deposit, and IUD insertion, should also be taken into account (Alyamlah & Alhindy, 2012). Gonococcal infection in women is particularly linked with cervicitis and PSN. Short-term vaginal discharge and cervical bleeding are the most prevalent symptoms. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent causative agent in cervicitis, and it is often asymptomatic (Ju et al., 2012; Lash, Tileva, Joura, & St Fem, 2010). Trichomonas vaginalis is another important causative commensal vaginal pathogens that mediates through mucosal cell invasion and elicits the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Sperling, 2004)."}

{"text": "Question: What other conservative treatment should keep trying? \n ### Answer: The regenerative process being trialled could be spurred by low inflammation and a viral niche that is persistent, and therefore very low transduction efficiency is the limiting factor, which correlates perfectly with earlier work by Mascott . Peripheral ventricular stroke  and removal of foreign bodies from the ventricle  are occasionally associated with de novo regeneration of GFAP+ ependymal cells. The ventricle is a cavity not a blood vessel, but being vascularised has not appeared to help produce any regeneration of missing cells. As mentioned, no worse could be predicted by exceeding the regenerative capacity due to differentiation to basal cells is a common finding with regeneration. The meninges are another possible reservoir of progenitor cells  but work on duplicated meninges in knockouts is negative ."}

{"text": "Question: How often can I used the netty pot? \n ### Answer: The key to effective organic farming is the periodic exposure of the crop residue to livestock or more. Therefore, in fact, netty pot is an appropriate and daily formulation for effective rotation. In fact, netty pot can be used any time during the growing season of vegetables. The manure is usually put in the field every rainy season or every three days during the rainy season. However, our advice is to use it every three days. Even children can do this. We have conducted field research and developed it based on the determination that it can be used effectively in areas where it may be difficult to apply organic fertilizer every season. The purpose of this practice is to emphasize that netty half-moon pots can be used very conveniently even in small farms.To what depth can the netty pot be buried in the Field?The netty half-moon pot is applied to garden, flower, and vegetable fields. Therefore, it is buried in or on the surface in the ground in a way that we can easily see. However, if the planting is done with small seeds, it is buried in the ground leaving only the handle exposed on the surface."}

{"text": "Question: Do I need antibiotics? \n ### Answer: \u2014a test of the rule \u201cantibiotic and other infection control\u201d will be triggered if any of the following reactions is given: fever (> 38.0 \u00b0C, repeat when shooting up to 38.5 \u00b0C), increased leukocytes > 10 * 109/L), increased C-reactive protein C-reactive protein > 100 mg/L, purulent secretion or tissue, or systemic embolism. At this point, the treatment initiation is judged by the physicians as an infection, to start a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, and to wear air leak care within 2\u20136 h, and the positive culture specimens are beneficial to avoid unnecessary use. When it is overcombination, unnecessary discontinuing, reducing air leak care, and related to other frequently used antibiotics, are useful to prevent infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are not only without benefit, but also may contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant mechanisms [25\u201328]."}
{"text": "Question: What sort of stool softener would you recommend? \n ### Answer: It is well accepted and has been widely proposed that increased intake of dietary fiber could reduce constipation. Its main role is to enhance the trapping of water through a gel-forming process that alters the visco-elastic properties of feces, which in turn stimulates colon motility directly and indirectly through stimulating endogenous secretion of water 17, 28. The rationale for oral treatment with soluble fibers for chronic functional constipation is based on several observations 29. Soluble fiber can perform five functions: enhancing fecal bulking, maximizing the amount of water absorbed, creating an intestinal microbe-active substrate, stimulating bowel motility, and enhancing maintenance of continence 17, 28. A study including daily diet and lifestyle advice (crude fibers 15\u201330g/d) compared to lifestyle and stool softeners, laxatives and enemas 18 over a 2 years period found that personal hygiene products, stool softeners, laxatives and enemas ranged from 87% to 88%, far greater than the numbers found in any study to date 6. Among people with functional constipation who take prunes, the incidence of personal hygiene products, stool softeners, laxatives and enemas decreased 19% over four months 30. Prunes taken as a diet supplement (30.5 \u00b1 7.2 g/week) for four months in people with functional constipation caused a significant 52% reduction in the number of personal hygiene products, a 16% reduction in over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, and no change in prescription laxatives and enemas 22. Consumption of 75.0 \u00b1 6.7 g prune juice would produce significant reduction of over-the-counter (3%) personal hygiene products, (57%) stool softeners, and 13.5% over-the-counter (5%) and prescription (5%) laxatives 13.

Antacids were not readily available in the early part of the twentieth century. Bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol released in 1898, would have been used later. The far more prevalent ulcers were caused by heavy consumption of spicy foods, and smoking. Both of these conditions were mostly reversed by quitting smoking and modifying one's diet to exclude select foods. They were not treated with medications of any kind. Aspirin seemed to exacerbate the pain and lesions. Hence a treatise on aspirin. Bismuth salts, however, came to be used in the late twentieth century as a treatment for non-reticular ulcers."}

You can also consider Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 to be useful in acute infectious diarrhea. Probiotic yogurt or fermented milk is good for lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus casesi DN114001 is effective against childhood respiratory infections. Lactobacillus fermentum B94 is good against childhood atopic dermatitis. There is little evidence about the effects of probiotics on geriatric patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If you want to use any kind of probiotic, consult your doctor or pharmacist before you start."}

{"text": "Question: Would aleve or Tylenol be best for the pain I feel mostly at night? \n ### Answer: This may seem obvious to some, but physiotherapists hear this from patients every day \u2013 is it possible or advisable to differentiate? It is possible when considering drugs to compare analgesic potencies, side effect profiles, efficacy (in the rheumatoid arthritis patient group) and whether the pain is due to acute or chronic inflammatory/neuropathic pain. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that medications can influence gene expression in human cells, which for pain may include infiltrating inflammatory cells. In our patient population, we sometimes suggest that initially a \u2018medium\u2019 potency medication with an acute inflammatory effect may encourage more arthritic reactions in subsequent years. For this reason we may choose, for example, atorvastatin and co-codamol. Aspirin (an anti-inflammatory agent) is assumed to be a safe drug, yet studies have noted early dosing in childhood may be associated with cognitive defects, depression and vascular morbidity.[10\u201313] Aspirin is not recommended for young adults given its long QT syndrome implications. We sometimes discuss with patients that if they feel one NSAID is ineffective they may not wish to continue using it 20 to 30 years later, but should consider a shorter course of stronger drug, and so minimise their total drug exposure. Patients may complain of stomach disruption and the associated acid reflux while on long-term NSAID. It is important to emphasise that these medications do have serious adverse effects that need to be assessed, but which can, with different applications, be minimised."}

{"text": "Question: Is it ok to take probiotics while pregnant? \n ### Answer: It seems logical that the best thing we can do for our baby is to use prenatal probiotics to strengthen the gut and promote delivery of good bacteria. However, to date little research has been done on probiotics in human pregnancy. We should be cautious, as probiotics hold the potential for an immune over-reaction (exactly what we want to avoid during pregnancy). Chronic inflammation has been suggested as a potential risk factor for certain pregnancy complications, particularly in hypertensive-pregnancy . For example, hypertension and pre-eclampsia can result in the placental production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a  (Figure 2). Because certain probiotics are natural stimulants of cytokine production, we have to be careful in choosing a \u201cgood bacteria\u201d to take. Hypertensive-pregnancy is the second leading cause of Maternal and Neonatal mortality in Global North and Global South . In addition, hypertensive-pregnancy is a known risk factor for PID and is associated with antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Hedrich et al., noted that normal pregnancy immunoeffector activities were not altered after probiotic treatment, and supplementation with probiotics throughout pregnancy was deemed safe for both mothers and fetuses. The author also noted that probiotic inclusion in basic nutritional supplements, such as Iron vitamin complex supplementation, could provide optimal treatment for pre-existing anemia (common in pregnancy) and enhance fetal iron accretion."}

These include but are not limited to the onset of symptoms, duration of illness, the ability of the child to open the eye, eyelid swelling or cherry eye, number of episodes with fever, redness of the white of the eyes, sticky mucus/discharge from eyes, other symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, otitis media, or the complexity of the problem, as this will also guide the decision to refer the child. Besides, by understanding the spelling of conjunctivitis on the clinical note, it will be very helpful in the next section of discussion to guide the decision to treat or refer the child."}
{"text": "Question: Does it matter if drooling occurs during sleep? \n ### Answer: Yes, it matters to the level of distress the parent experiences, regardless of the volume of drool. It may also influence occurrence of parentally-perceived and other sleep problems, such as sleep disruption, exposure to hypoxia, and parental sleep loss. These findings add information on the role of sleep disorders in drooling and influence on parental distress. It is theoretically possible that LDD reduces the volume of air passing through the nasal cavity, produce negative intrathoracic pressure swings and thus reduce nasal pressure (Kosak et al., 1980), and potentially induce obstructive sleep apnea (Butler et al., 2003). Clearly there is a need to explore the mechanistic interaction between LDD and sleep disordered breathing and expand our knowledge on the major function of LDD and its presumed protective value. This may enable recommendations on how to manage drooling and further contribute to prevent or treat nighttime drooling."}

{"text": "Question: What can I do to prevent the yeast infection? \n ### Answer: Here are some suggestions to decrease and treat yeast infections:1. Wear breathable cotton underwear and fit them loosely to the body. More air circulation around your genitals may help to keep the penile skin dry and less prone to yeast overgrowth.2. After masturbating or sex, ensure your genitalia are clean and dry. Avoid wearing condoms if possible during masturbation as they can trap moisture so that it remains around your genitals.3. Keeps your genitals dry and try to avoid wet foreskin. Try to dry your foreskin skin after cleaning your penis. Moisturizing with lotion is vital as it maintains the penile skin's health, but try to choose a water-based rather than oil-based moisturizer.4. Wear baggy, loose-fitting, and cotton-made shorts or underwear. You can use a barrier cream if you are planning to wear tight-fitting pants for a prolonged period.5. Wash your genitals regularly using soap and water but try to avoid harsh detergents (ask for mild soap-free/alcohol-free). Rinse well and pat the area dry instead of rubbing it vigorously.6. Use sufficient amount of water and soap for bathing. Avoid using bubble baths as they can cause irritation. Be gentle while drying the genital skin.7. If you have recurrent yeast infections, get an antifungal cream to keep at home to apply yourself or have a partner apply it to you once per week. Moreover, to prevent infection recurrence, avoid wearing tight-fitting pants and non-breathable fabrics.8. You can eat unsweetened yogurt with active cultures of Lactobacillus or Lactobacillus acidophilus live bacteria as they might be beneficial and reduce the number of yeast infections (8).When to contact a doctorGenerally, it is a serious infection if:\uf077Your symptoms do not improve after one week of OTC treatment.\uf077Your symptoms worsen after treatment.\uf077You experience more than one yeast infection per month.Or if you are immunocompromised (e.g., HIV positive) or diabetic and have any symptoms of yeast infection.Materials and methodsDigital media examinationsGP photo notes including"}

{"text": "Question: What fever level should I be concerned? \n ### Answer: Fever \u2265 102\u00b0F is considered a moderate fever, whereas fever higher than 102\u00b0F is considered a high fever. Fever needs to reach 103\u00b0F or more for the fever to be considered a \u201cvery high fever\u201d that can be associated with serious illness.(2)Which of the following is considered to be a serious illness?The following are considered to be serious and life-threatening diseases: pneumonia, meningitis, tuberculosis, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis. In addition, certain viral diseases such as measles, Rubella, mumps, varicella, viral hepatitis, and hepatitis A and B are considered serious illnesses.(2)4.What is the route of transmission of this disease?Most of the diseases above are transmitted via droplet particles released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This particularly does not apply only to the viral infectious diseases mentioned above but also to most of the bacterial diseases mentioned above. Importantly, tuberculosis transmission occurs only when a person is exposed to the cough or sneezes while tubercle bacilli were in the patient's mouth cavity or airways. Tuberculosis can also transmit through airborne route.(2)5.Which disease may require the identification of the organism?The accurate diagnosis of some diseases (infectious and non-infectious) requires the identification or isolation of the microorganism, because only finding the microorganism can confirm the disease.(2)6.Which is an invasive disease?An invasive disease presents when a pathogen normally localized to the skin or mucous membranes usually will spread and spread into the bloodstream and tissue sites. Such diseases are connected with high morbidity and mortality rates. These diseases are: \u226aBartonella quintana\u226b\u2013 a bacterium that transmitted via body fluids and is responsible for trench fever or Trench Fever; HIV (Human Immunodeficiency virus)\u2013a virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome); \u226aHepatitis A virus\u226b and \u226aHepatitis B virus\u226b\u2013 transmitted via blood and body fluids and cause chronic infections of the liver.

{"text": "Question: Do you recommend a vitamin for urinary tract health after taking antibiotics? \n ### Answer: Lanreotide is usually not recommended. Calcium and vitamin D is sometimes advised. It is used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin E plays an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, so a high concentration of alpha-tocopherol in the bone marrow can accelerate the processes of osteoporosis. Here, vits is included. Quercetin or CVD is often recommended since it seems to both maintain the collagen and elastin structure that sustains the anatomical integrity of the urogenital and digestive mucosa, and contribute to tissue repair by scavenging of free radicals and reduction of inflammation. And methionine seemed beneficial especially in peripheral neuropathy. However, l-\u03b1-Lipoic acid is not listed for a reason there. Also, it is important to contain vitamin D and K. In that sense, you should mention about the olanzapine-induced bradycardia, who was in vitamin D and K deficiency. And mecobalamin seems to be beneficial in intestinal fibrosis with tetracyclines. But, as I said previously, the number of papers is small for these points, so I understand that you need to report about the most well-known therapies. Vitamin B12 is used in the methionine treatment, so that was the reason I wanted to mention it again."}

{"text": "Question: I would like to ask, how does Flonase help with ear fluid? \n ### Answer: Will it drain fluid out if there is too much already? Since it may mix up with the infection, I suspect it will make the ears worse. I hope you can clarify this for me. Thank you. Flonase (fluticasone propionate) is a topical steroid frequently used to relieve allergy and other nasal symptoms. It works by reducing inflammation and congestion in the nose. I am not aware of any evidence that it affects ear fluid. It\u2019s possible that the ear and nose are somehow related (like perhaps the linings of the structures secrete mucous with a similar composition). I suspect it would be not harmful to try it on your ears, but I am not convinced it would be helpful. These are my opinions, notbased on any evidence, so please consult a doctor before you use it on your ears. Surgical interventions often arise when conservative management has failed, with bilateral disease or with complications. [2, 3]. Tympanostomy tube insertion is often the first surgical option and is used to maintain a perforation and allow pressure equalization between the mastoid cavity and the external environment. The use of ventilation tubes allows for ventilation of the middle ear, resolution of otosclerosis, or atrophy of the mucosa and promotes re-epithelialization.\u00b0 Thus, performing tympanostomy tube placements requires a minimal quantum of experience. This study aims to evaluate the use of the HEARO atlas to facilitate tympanostomy tube insertion for otosclerosis."}

Used Celebrex in the past but felt that it was not strong enough- Asked by Patient 4 -GINA TreatmentIn humans, exogenous administration of IFN-\u03b11 is used in the treatment of certain Eastern cancer, or to boost the immune response in the case of hepatitis C . In MS, administration of IFN-\u03b2 is designed to block autoimmune disease progression by limiting T-cell proliferation, simultaneously dampening Th-1 and enhancing Treg 5 response. It specifically modulates peripheral T cells, adding to the pool of circulatory Tregs supported by their antigen-independent survival . INF-\u03b2 hampers T-cell dependent cytokine storms by regulating the demarcation of T-cell activity by modulating inflammatory cytokine synthesis, indirectly empowering smoldering Tregs to transcend Th-1 responses. According to Coppi\u2019s study, IFN-\u03b2 diminishes Th1-to-T-reg redistribution and enhances T-reg-associated function . Further, development of IFN-inducible CXCR3 negative Tregs\u2019 pool was shown in a study by Nishimura . Although various factors are involved in Treg development, CXCR3 appears to be an interesting molecule to analyze Treg migration to sites of chronic inflammation.

{"text": "Question: What is trichomonas? \n ### Answer: Trichomonas is a parasitic protozoan that causes trichomoniasis. It is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in humans and is caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. In humans, it typically affects the urethra, vagina, and cervix. In animals, it can affect the genital, oral, and rectal mucosa. The parasite is transmitted sexually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth. The symptoms of trichomoniasis vary depending on the location of the infection and the sex of the patient. In women, it can cause vaginal discharge, itching, and pain during urination. In men, it can cause penile discharge, itching, and pain during urination. In both women and men, it can cause a temporary increase in the number of white blood cells in the cervical mucus or semen."}

{"text": "Question: Is augmentin the same as amoxicillin? \n ### Answer: Amoxicillin is a penicillin synthetase that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is most effective against Gram-negative bacteria and has excellent coverage of common respiratory and genitourinary tract pathogens. Augmentin is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor that potentiates the enzyme inhibition of amoxicillin. Given the mechanism of action, the question could be raised: Is augmentin the same as amoxicillin? The answer is: no. In addition, clavulanic acid has often been used in combination with other antibiotics for its ability to inhibit enzymes such as beta-lactamases, aminopeptidases, phosphinases, and other lysine proteases found in many resistant bacteria.9 Therefore, antibiotics that have been combined with clavulanic acid do not have the same properties as amoxillin."}

The bacteria only play a role in triggering the inflammatory pathway in a susceptible host. The reasoning that it shows up in mixed infections with Aspergillus is mostly due to (a) the procedure of how they collect the clinical samples to test for infection in the setting of HIV and (b) that aspergillus is a common coexisting infection in HIV and both the saliva and blood stream contain fragments of the bacteria upon infection."}

The symptoms include a cough that lasts for 2 to 8 weeks, whooping, and sometimes vomiting. The cough can be very severe and may interfere with breathing.

{"text": "Question: What is the benzonatate? \n ### Answer: Benzonatate is a centrally acting natural respiratory stimulant. The drug binds to \u03bc-opioid receptors located in brain areas that regulate respiration in an agonistic manner. The drug was developed as a substitute for codeine, which has similar respiratory stimulatory but more potent analgesic effects than benzonatate. Combined with citric acid and sodium benzoate, benzonatate is used to relieve cough in cough syrup."}
{"text": "Question: Is it better to try not to cough or to cough? \n ### Answer: Control over coughing would surely be beneficial, since cough is not harmful to the patient except when it persists as a chronic event. An attenuation of the cough reflex would reduce effects on work and others, and there may be interventions that could be helpful to achieve this. But it remains unclear if attenuating the cough reflex would have harmful consequences, particularly in smokers and those with reduced lung function. The benefits of altered cough reflex would thus need to balance a risk of difficulty clearing mucus, thereby setting up a vicious cycle of respiratory illness. It will be important to determine the extent to which cough, induced by smoke exposures, encompasses the responses of cough rather than impulse responding to mechanostimulation. Thus, better understanding of regional lung inflammatory responses following smoking will help provide a basis for developing approaches to interventions and better treatments for cough, such as drugs, biofeedback, and/or deep breathing manoeuvres such as lung-stretch to reduce the reflex sensitivity to cough. After establishing that cough induced by smoke is of intermic lock origin, the reflex can be interfered with by vagal nerve stimulation  or interrupting bronchopulmonary C-fiber afferent traffic. The attraction of stimulating vagal fibers to suppress cough is that there is a dearth of vagal bronchopulmonary afferent input during rapid breathing at rest, so the concern about interrupting breathing disappears . Thus, the afferent vagal bronchopulmonary inputs during rapid breathing at rest can then be targeted ."}

{"text": "Question: Just wanted to question if you think 3 days would be enough to treat a UTI or why I would have been prescribed more days in the past? \n ### Answer: The 3-day limit of treatment seems a bit short, because 3 days is about the time when most bladder bacteria are even able to begin to replicate and I think that the treatment needs to introduce more than the theoretical amount of IJEF when dealing with UTIs, since the biofilm is essential for pathogenicity of the disease.

Three T2s and 6 T1s seem like a rather few number of data points to base this decision on, I am on the side of the reviewers here. There was no trend towards benefit with the SSRI either so this is not just a case of SSRI not working fast enough. Another red flag is the lack of a placebo group. This should be there, particularly given the \"drug's\" immediate and rapid onset which I find suspicious of being a non-drug effect (Placebo's lag in onset, usually about 2 weeks, has been shown in multiple clinical trials). With every pill that is taken before a shock aversive, the probability of serving as placebo is reduced and not reaching a main shock every time in this study may then itself have served as a predictor too."}

No, currently there are no pharmacological treatments proven to improve itching in AD and even short doses of corticosteroids are not indicated as it may worsen the pruritus. EFA help to alleviate global disease activity including chronic eczema, pruritus and sleep disturbances, but this should not imply a specific effect on pruritus, since when EFA are beneficial on different parameters, global disease activity will also be improved/reduced. The same concept applies to low dose tricyclic antidepressants. Comment 2:84. What if the patient does not tolerate EFA? Comment 3:92. Therefore, could the authors suggest a panel of patients to identify those who might benefit from EFA or other approved or even off-label treatments based on the different sub-phenotypes, severity or chronicity? Comment 4:134. The itch/scratched phenomenon is a manifestation of chronic (neuro)inflammation throughout the skin, triggered by environmental factors, proceeding an epidermal neutrophilic inflammation, which promotes the release of inflammatory mediators aggravating the skin-barrier function. It also appears that the inflammation progresses into the brain, and also manifests as itch/scratching in the brain. This is known as the \u201coutside-in itch-scratch-itch cycle\u201d .

{"text": "Question: How fast does paxlovid work? \n ### Answer: At the time of this writing, the literature produced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is dominated by studies of courses of therapy, which requires 5 days of treatment, for which 2 to 5 days of follow-up have been provided. In this interim summary of 108,649 patients in 18 publications, paxlovid reduction of viral load hemorrhagic strokes rate occurred with impressive rapidity, particularly within 48 to 72 hours. At the second day of treatment, a decline of \u223c4 logs could be seen (3). Although these were published data on early treatment of COVID-19 before marketing authorization was approved, there is no clear signal that early treatment of acute stroke by IV thrombolysis is qualitatively different from chronic stroke where treatment with paxlovid is currently approved. Acute and chronic stroke should not be treated as separate disease entities, because acute stroke is often a sequela of chronic stroke in patients with cardioembolic embolic risk factors. Finally, no information is provided on how fast the underlying chronic stroke will improve. As paxlovid treatment is not a cure but a prolonged process, it makes sense to treat patients until clinical improvement, neurological symptoms improvement or death. The neurological improvement process should continue in journal publications, in association with direct evidence of underlying viral load reduction. In this case, paxlovid appeared to be effective within 72 hours of death, but it remains unknown whether neurological symptoms improve such as in other conditions (stroke, heart attack). If the other approved indications for paxlovid vary little from the original half-life and dosages, even in cases of stroke, half the original dosages are also expected to be effective, if government regulators approve lower costs to expand low- and middle-income countries, without undue delay, an improved profile."}

The pathogenesis of BV is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including changes in the vaginal microbiome, host immune response, and hormonal changes. The most common theory is that an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome, with a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in anaerobic bacteria, leads to an overgrowth of these bacteria and the production of amines and other metabolites that are toxic to the host. This can lead to inflammation and irritation of the vaginal mucosa, which can cause symptoms such as itching, burning, and discharge."}

{"text": "Question: Will the steroid also help with the itchiness? \n ### Answer: This is not a trivial question. The development of itch even in healthy people is heralded by neural plasticity changes and dysregulation of neuroimmune phenotypes (see for example Ko et al., 2018). Itch involves on same side of the brain whereas pain is mostly processed in the other, somatosensory cortex. This point needs to be more discussed given the presence of antipruritics in every dexamethasone loading dose formulation."}

It has to be something that goes down cause I can\u2019t not shit (FG1 participant 2).The feeling that solid dosage tablets are difficult to absorb is widespread, and concern that antibiotics at this time were probably insufficiently powerful (none had had samples tested for resistance) is clear.

{"text": "Question: Are there any alternatives to the Wellbutrin? \n ### Answer: Most cases of VTE are associated with reversible risk factors, so these should be brought under control whenever possible and changes in therapy initiated where possible. For patients with an unprovoked VTE, some studies suggest that aspirin 325 mg /d may reduce the recurrence rate and long term prophylaxis with anticoagulants may be appropriate for women with hormone-related risk factors including estrogen, oral contraceptives and progesterone-one only pills . However, no proof of long-term or short-term mortality benefit exists for patients treated with aspirin and its use is only recommended for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction. Recurrent risk for VTE remains high in some selected patients, for example patients with idiopathic pulmonary embolism who appear to share common risk factors with the tamoxifen women (eg older women, obese, postmenopausal). There may well be an underlying inherent risk of clotting with tamoxifen that will put these patients at higher risk of future thromboembolism. We continue to support the recommendations of Carroll et al (2008) : Tamoxifen Continuation Plus Aspirin (TAP) (tamoxifen plus aspirin daily) is now our preferred strategy as it will result in lower health care costs as compared with tamoxifen alone. However, if a patient is at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend that tamoxifen be stopped and replaced by some other type of estrogen."}
{"text": "Question: Is there a way to prevent these vertigo attacks? \n ### Answer: The answer is yes. The most important preventive measure is to avoid the triggers. The most common triggers are head movements, especially rotation, and changes in head position. Therefore, it is important to avoid quick head movements and to keep the head in a stable position. This can be done by using a neck brace or a neck collar. Another important preventive measure is to avoid activities that cause vertigo attacks, such as climbing stairs, walking on uneven surfaces, and driving. It is also important to avoid activities that cause fatigue, such as prolonged standing, walking, and lifting heavy objects."}
{"text": "Question: What is causing the throbbing pain and sensitivity to light? \n ### Answer: The answer is a condition called subconjunctival hemorrhage. It is a collection of blood under the conjunctiva, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually caused by a blow to the eye or a hard eye-rubbing, but it can also occur spontaneously. The pain and sensitivity to light usually last for a few days, but the hemorrhage itself can take a couple of weeks to clear up."}
{"text": "Question: How long is this contagious? \n ### Answer: Recent studies estimate that symptomatic individuals are contagious for about one and a half weeks, starting from when their symptoms begin. It is not yet known whether pre-symptomatic individuals are contagious. However, evidence from other viruses and nCoV-MERS indicates that they might well be able to infect others for 1\u20134 days before they develop symptoms."}

Quoting and linking to easy-to-use, reputable natural therapies from government or university-affiliated health websites would have been beneficial, given that many patients seek out the internet for information and treatment options. The lack of such information is not altogether surprising given that the scientific data remain preliminary and the impact on mortality and morbidity from pneumonia has yet to be elucidated."}

{"text": "Question: Is Claritin or Zyrtec safe with breastfeeding? \n ### Answer: Both Zyrtec and Claritin are considered safe for use during breastfeeding. However, Claritin is more likely to cause side effects in breastfed infants than Zyrtec. Claritin is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, and it is metabolized to desmethylclaritin in the infant\u2019s body. Desmethylclaritin is the active metabolite of Claritin, and it has a longer half-life than Claritin. This means that infants are more likely to experience side effects from Claritin than from Zyrtec."}
{"text": "Question: Ok, would ice or heat help as well? \n ### Answer: Since a big issue seems to be inflammation. In that case I would goes towards heat application (and massage/lymph flow help unrefractory areas), if the lymphedema is more of a chronic condition with fibrosed tissues and partial lymphatic block (I dont know the specifics of the case). If the lymphedema is more acute and caused by a disturbance in lymphatic flow more recently, I would go for the more anti-inflammatory type of treatment. I would then do compressive bandaging only in the case of acute or recent lymphatic obstruction, as I find that excessive pressure and/or compression on a chronic condition will just lead to more fibrosis in the skin. You may have over 60% of lymphatic drainage from tissues being though afferent lymphatics (I think this percentage may be even higher, not sure though, a few recent studies have confirmed the role of this type of lymphatic vessels as drainage pathways in tems of a rapid drainage in upper and lower tissues at least!'ll refer to this another time.), so loss of these pathway/function through excessive pressure and fibrosis, will give a loss of function, as the lymph still has to go somewhere, so it just goes into venous circulation if it cant go through the afferent lymphatics."}

{"text": "Question: Is it possible to get caphalexin instead? \n ### Answer: We would rather not use amoxicillin for this experiment (unless the MIC is significantly different) due to it\u2019s extensive use in medicine to treat E. coli infections and the lack of information regarding prescribed antibiotics that are safe to fermenters. On that note, if caphalexin is not an option, we should include amoxicillin resistance as one of the considerations in discussing the results."}

{"text": "Question: Is it possible for it to be pneumonia? \n ### Answer: Lung ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and the differentiation of lobar and interstitial pneumonia. In addition, because it is radiation free, the amount of usage in children has increased . Determination of pneumonia with dilatation of the bronchi on ultrasonography is accepted as positive, but dilatation of the bronchus is a severely generalized finding that occurs in various diseases as well as in asthma, COPD, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and community-acquired pneumonia. Accordingly, the patient cannot be evaluated on the basis of this specific finding alone. In addition, detection of changes indicating pulmonary edema may occur in both acute bronchiolitis and asthma . However, the operating principle of ultrasound wand in these diseases is different, with a target better seen in acute bronchiolitis than in asthma and there being no pathology seen on CT of the chest. Additionally, the frequency of deterioration is seen in acute bronchiolitis. For this reason, although dilatation purulent bronchi are detected on ultrasound in asthma and acute bronchiolitis, differentiation should be given particular importance by the physician."}

{"text": "Question: Is it ok to have antibotics and cough medicine at the same time? \n ### Answer: No, it is not recommended to take antibiotics and cough medicine at the same time. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral infections such as the common cold. Taking antibiotics when you have a viral infection, such as the common cold, will not help you get better and may cause antibiotic resistance."}
{"text": "Question: Is this something that will go away on its own/with just monistat? \n ### Answer: She may have tried monistat but this is a first line and she should have had LPV with it because it would not have gone away on its own. She doesn\u2019t have CAI as that is not a first line, it needs to be proven she has CAI after first being treated with monistat and azole plus LN; in which case it is not spontaneously going way.

Then when she heals completely the yeast also disappears. Maybe associate with herpes in my mind being that this scarring is now adhering to the labia."}
{"text": "Question: Is it normal to have slight intermittent blurring with a bacterial pink eye? \n ### Answer: It's been about 24 hours since BC+ to BC- and 2 weeks since the last dose of Erythromycin and the blurring is present. It can be difficult to see through my eye but only during certain times of the day. If the doctors and pharmacists on here haven't had this experience themselves, I strongly recommend that they seek the advice of an ophthalmologist. Visual clarity when suffering from an eye infection leaves a lot to be desired. It's a frustrating and rather disconcerting experience, and it can hinder quick and precise movement of the eye, thus slowing down simple functions such as picking up an object or drinking from a cup while walking. It's markedly diminishing with the Erythromycin drops but was still moderately present."}
{"text": "Question: What are the long term deficits that may happen? \n ### Answer: The question suggests that apraxia is always permanent. I am not aware of this standard view on apraxia (see below) but there are temporary symptoms in apraxia of object use \u2013 e.g. in the right IPS so called virtual lesion syndrome (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-9109(13)60154-7). In apraxia of gesture(use) the deficits are more often more permanent (Stanfield and Evans, 2009). I agree that, if one treats the amnestic and apraxic deficits separately only the first one could be completely recovered. For some aphasic patients with apraxia of object use the deficit will be permanent, for other it might be partly reviewed with training (I am not saying that this will be the case in most patients, but it is not true that the lesion always results in permanent apraxia). Therefore I object to the following sentence in the last paragraph: we can term apraxia as permanent. This point needs to be addressed properly."}

{"text": "Question: Is there an antibiotic that could help ? \n ### Answer: A few years ago it seemed that antibiotics killed off some of the leptoplasts and inflammation even though they did not clear the infection. There does not seem to be a class of drugs that is uniformly superior. If your illness is helminth driven the two most powerful antibiotics are the floxquinones or the tetracyclines (doxycycline). The floxquinones cover the Coxiella bacterium and a number of the anaerobes that contribute to Lyme and Titan-3  and to a lesser extent the melioidasis of tularetum and a few enterobacteria."}
{"text": "Question: Should I put the drops in both eyes to prevent it from spreading to my other eye? \n ### Answer: Many eyedrops that are used for anterior segment disease, including antibiotics such as chloramphenicol or tobramycin, are used in both eyes during the infectious episode in eyes with unilateral disease. However, this practice may be unnecessary for some antibiotics and may explain why significant numbers of patients develop macular oedema in the fellow eye [74, 75]. There seems some evidence that in general, if one eye has active infection, these of use drops may have some transient effect in the fellow eye. The antibiotics used, the formulation, the route of application, the duration of the infection and the possible concurrent disease may determine whether drops should be used in both eyes [42, 74, 75]. This should be thought about when considering potential treatments for CMV retinal infection, particularly steroids, which are more likely to work in one eye than both eyes, and antivirals (ganciclovir) which are presumably more likely to work in both eyes."}

{"text": "Question: Does pelvic exam mean virginal discharge? \n ### Answer: No. Virginal discharge is any discharge that is expelled by the vaginal or vulvar skin and may or may not be from a physical source within the vaginal canal (uterus, cervix, placentae, fetus), just as vaginal bleeding is blood expelled from the vaginal or vulvar skins. Post Coital bleeding (PCB) refers to bleeding that occurs following vaginal intercourse (sexual intercourse). PCB that is heavy and/or associated with pain should be assessed in the hospital for sexually transmitted infection (STI), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if appropriate.

{"text": "Question: Would high heart rate be caused by being overweight at all? \n ### Answer: A high BMI along such a system, with high HRV to all self-reported weight scales in Table 1, seems to suggest that being overweight causes poor health generally. And especially poor cardiovascular health: indeed, as predicted by Bloch\u2019s findings, we observe a steady negative correlation of BMI on the HRV descriptor of IQR. Weight seems to facilitate worst outcomes, and by this hypothesis, the more a body weights against the normal ideal of a healthy BMI, the worse are its general health consequences. Hence the similarities between using BMI as a 0-point measure of obesity and using zero as a measure of no diabetes does indeed seem well-founded. But this is more than a metaphor: it suggests (via equation 5 and the appendix) that obese bodies may need higher blood pressure to meet bodily needs, but so at the expense of higher mortality rates."}

{"text": "Question: What's the STD test? \n ### Answer: Large sample size can increase the statistical power of the test and then the negative result be replaced by the positive one. Moreover, there are some problems in this study which attributable to the experiment design. First of all, the plasma from the same condition should be hybridized for replicate, and then its non-biological variation can be subtracted through a series of biological tests. Besides, quality control of microarray experiments including chip plotting, data normalization, and publication of the raw data is necessary for the research. In fact, lots of microarray meta-analysis are designed based on multiple studies conducted by heterogeneous platform. Some algorithms especially CEL method were developed for correcting different platforms to ensure the reliability of transcriptomic analysis. Zhu, G  presented an effective CEL method for meta-analysis of gene expression data. Wada, Y.

{"text": "Question: Ok at what point should I be concerned that it goes beyond viral and develops into infection? \n ### Answer: A: That's a really good question. I think that's an evolving question that people don't yet have the answer to. The problem with people with cancer, if they get infected, it can go badly. And so as quickly as we can tell you how to tell patients when to seek care, we should do that. So, I can tell you that in mild cases, where a patient might have a cough or runny nose, that would not be a reason to start antibiotics, especially if it's been within a week of getting sick. That would, again, be a reason to maybe go to the gym but certainly not to see a doctor. But if that persists and also maybe associated with fever or some gastrointestinal symptoms where, then it's appropriate to go to the doctor and get a good workup. The guidelines generally say three days of symptoms or purulent sputum or having a temperature over 38.3 [centigrade]. For a not mild case, with shortness of breath or two weeks of symptoms or a patient that's getting worse, that patient needs to be seen in the ER."}

As all antibiotics administered prior to constatation of symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis may have a causative factor in the pathophysiology of necrotizing enterocolitis, most practitioners start with AB. Once the pathophysiology of the necrotizing enterocolitis has been established and the patient is deemed stable enough to turn away from intensive care, the antibiotics are a deescalated and the patient placed on prophylactic measures such as space seperation between feedings and continued aggressive milk fortification as it seems the immunological maturity of the newborn influences to development of necrotizing enterocolitis.

It is based on the observation that itch and pain share common neuroanatomical pathways and neurotransmitters, and that itch and pain can be induced by stimulation of the same dermatomes (10, 11). In addition, itch and pain can be induced by the application of the same pruritogenic or noxious chemicals to the skin (12). The itch-pain continuum is also supported by the observation that itch can be induced by the application of noxious chemicals to the skin (13)."}

{"text": "Question: and what time of day is best for taking Lexapro? \n ### Answer: These things should be included in the initial information provided about a medication. I spoke with one pharmacist who recommended a reduced starting dose of 3 milligrams per day and one pharmacist who suggested a maintained lower starting dose middle method, but neither gave reasons for this, they merely offered these suggestions. But specifically, for some patients, 5 milligrams might be too much, too fast, and starting at lower than the most common starting dose may cause fewer side effect issues than jumping right into the most common starting dose. Like I said, this is just one example, but this entire post is about a lack of standardized initial information about medications for patients. I think it would be really easy to have a national database of the most commonly recommended initial dose and other suggestions for specific medications. Often, the call to include such information in initial visit plans or in handouts is indirect: there is research that has shown effects on adherence or demonstrating how including this information at the first visit could serve to reassure initial visitors. But what I\u2019m arguing here is that there is value in including such information, namely patient-centered, anecdotal evidence at the visiting patient\u2019s level. Furthermore, many medications and medical treatments come with a long list of stigmatizing or even unintended side effects. I think patients deserve to know about what physicians have learned about side effect reduction and patient anecdotes about such adjustments. Whether or not stigma is reduced in this way is central to patient\u2019s post-therapy experiences, health outcomes, and adherence to treatment."}

Further studies, dynamically and precisely summarizing the nature of antimicrobial susceptibility, and its associated changing epidemiology, should always be in the spotlight. On the other hand, case reports may be the source that alerts clinicians on unusual and poorly recognized symptoms, and any detailed description about the place of presentation, clinical manifestations, laboratory test procedure, microbiological and histopathological processes, and its management, together with coherent discussion, can guide further studies and clarify previously unrecognized co-associations (Atl\u0131, Cetin, & Ba\u015ftu\u011f, 2020).Antibiotic sensitivity testing is important for the prevention of the emergence of resistant bacteria. Determination of the type of pathogenic and the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics prior to antibiotic therapy is one of the most important measures in the fight against microbial resistance. When considering case reports or case series reports, a follow-up that summarizes what strategies have been developed in resistant infections and which one is successful can be more informative.https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/114755/Research-Highlight-Antimicrobial-resistance-Almanac_tc.pdf?cgid=Research-Highlight-Antimicrobial-resistance-Almanac_tcfor programs that provide parenteral antibiotic therapy without delay in children with life-threatening infectious diseases:Remarks: In case of proven benefits in India that large group of children is provided parenteral antibiotic therapy without a delay, Editorial of Indian Pediatrics and Journal of Pediatric and Neonatal Care in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India alone (C.

Even in the small experimental group in this study, where the experimental condition was new to everyone in the group, with no one fully knowing the purpose of the intervention, and with even less prior experience with the methods of relaxation, the participants did in fact sustain their initiative to learn the method, and at the end of the study participants reported a dislike for ending the intervention.

{"text": "Question: Any suggestions on how to relieve the chest pain when coughing? \n ### Answer: Dr. Xiao's prescription for the Miracle of Medicine: First, the member of health care team asks the patient about the location and how severe the pain is. If the patient can point out where the pain is at all, it is because it is not very serious, according to the theory of Chinese medicine.

{"text": "Question: Is there anything you recommend over the counter for the vaginal itching? \n ### Answer: It sounds like something that can be treated with an antifungal cream? Talcum powder (I know it\u2019s not a good idea nowadays)? Anborol (Capilost powder)? Perhaps some essential oils? My understanding is that part of the doctor\u2019s recommendation is the hygienic aspect. So the idea is to maintain hygiene in an optimal way and remove any exogenous factors that could provoke the itching. This is where I think a different approach that explicitly addresses the hygienic and organic aspect of ovulatory itching would be useful."}

{"text": "Question: What about ice or heat? \n ### Answer: I homogenize the sample using the Tissue Syringes over ice. I like to keep everything cold for sample integrity through this process. That sample is super thick. That\u2019s what makes it harder to homogenize. I then take 1/3 of that and transfer it to the NucleoSpin RNA XS Linear Tube. That SDS in there will help with the cell lysis. After the lysing process in the NucleoSpin RNA XS Linear Tube, I\u2019d say it is on par with single cells, just to different tissue samples like a solid tissue or even fluid. This is our lysing process. The first method, it just takes a while and a lot of muscle \u2026and elbow grease. Elbow grease is really the key to that (single cell preparation)."}

For example, both motor oils have the same chemical compounds, but their structures are different (one has ethyl, and the other has bimetallic structure).The machine learning tools can be developed to search if the chemical structure of the drug MXME-003 is valid.There is always a possibility that the chemical structure of the artificial drug is similar to the structure of the natural drugs. It should be checked for such a possibility.Are there side effects for the Axitinib and its artificial drugs MXMS-001 and MXMS-002. The answer may depend on the detecting content of the cells in which the genes are expressed and their proteins are translated. These genes may be harmful or beneficial."}
