Researchers have conclusively linked low thyroid production to weight gain and inability to lose weight.\n\nThe thyroid goes beyond just metabolizing calories, however. Scientists now agree that the thyroid can help regulate everything from heart function to neurological function, immune function, even your fertility and your libido. Taking an in-depth look at the thyroid and circadian energy and hormones can help explain why and how these systems work.\n\nDifferent hormones impact many types of organ function, but the one hormone closely connected to the thyroid is thyroxine (or T3). Perhaps this is why the weight-loss specialist found in patients with low thyroid is not centered around the thyroid-only problem. This is why it can be helpful to consider how hormone and thyroid issues can impact you and your life. \n\nThe positive point to remember here is that starting to address your low T3 hormone problems immediately can start to help the symptoms of both low thyroid and low levels of metabolic activity \u2013 because once your thyroid starts to work again, you\u2019ll be better able to burn fat, and you\u2019re likely to feel more energized too.\n\n<h2><b>What is Thyroid Disease?</b></h2>\n\nThe thyroid is a tiny gland situated in your throat, just above your breastbone. The low thyroid doctor initially suspected that the hormone thyroxine from the thyroid assisted with BMI by helping the body burn fat by metabolizing sugars. However, this now appears to be incorrect and has been referred to as a \u2018Big Misconception.\u2019\n\nResearch now suggests that your thyroid mainly regulates metabolism by influencing the speed at which your cells burn calories. Several mechanisms contribute to this process of burning fat, but the most significant way the thyroid burns calories is to turn off any unnecessary or excess cells in your body that can not be used in the future.\n\nThis phenomenon is called cell turnover \u2013 where the body renews cells at a desired rate and only creates new cells for vital bodily functions. For example, it has been suggested that people with low thyroid are targeted by cancer-causing viruses because their body is not producing enough T3 to keep those cells from renewing and turning TB away from killing them as usual.\n\nAlthough the connection is supported by much evidence, there is still a great deal of dispute surrounding exactly why low thyroid impacts weight loss so much. \n\nShould low thyroid levels be correlated with obesity?

These are questions I frequently get from my patients.\n\nThe purpose of thyroid hormone in the body is to increase its ability to produce energy. When the thyroid gland underneath the neck does not produce enough hormone, a person becomes very lethargic, has low energy and finds it more difficult to lose weight or to maintain a desirable weight. An inadequate level of thyroid may also cause heart disease by increasing the blood cholesterol known as LDL and a slowing of the heart's beating rhythm. Patients with low thyroid are often emotionally flat and say they couldn't care less about their disease or their weight.\n\nBut weight gain tops their list of concerns and impediments to how they feel.\n\nHowever, when a patient is started on thyroid hormone and their thyroid levels are elevated to the normal range, their body functions are back to normal. This includes also the fat released into the bloodstream to be burned by the body. At the same time, there is often a gratifying and thankful loss of weight.\n\nSo for those concerned that thyroid medicines cause a patient to gain weight, this is not a problem since reversing an underactive thyroid often means weight loss.\n\nTo learn more about how thyroid medications work, read here: How Thyroid Medications Change Your Energy Level.", "prompt": "Does low thyroid contribute to weight gain?"}

They may recommend one of the following surgical procedures that can be performed depending on the gravity of your symptoms:\nA myringotomy the doctor will make an incision in your eardrum, using a narrow tube to pressure your ear and thus assisting your pressure.\nA mastoidectomy expands and replaces ear canal tissue to prevent future infections, inhibits and minimizes the risk of deafness.\n\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\n\nIf you're like many swimmers, you probably are meticulous about cleaning your ears after you swim to prevent ear infections. But, as the Chicago Tribune recently reported, you may not be cleaning your ears correctly after moving out of the water and into the locker room -- which could contribute to swimmer's ear.\n\n* After swimming, everything snug in the water should be removed from your ears.\n* Soak your hair and ears with a hairdryer.\n* For 2-3 days, use a solution of 30-70% vinegar mixed with equal parts warm water.\n* Use acetic acid, rose water for care for the ear a few days a week.\n* Let the solution or solution dry in your inside.\n\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n\nWarren Harrop.

Try to keep water out around your ears as much as possible. If you go to a pool, be careful not to let water go down your drain. Avoid the temptation to stick cotton swabs (q-tips) into your ear as they can push bacteria further in.\n\nA warm Epsom salt bath can be beneficial and even reduce the swelling of corns, callouses and inflammations. It\u2019s easy to prepare; just add 3/4 cup of Epsom salt to one cup of water. Pour it into your bath and soak for about 20 minutes.\n\nAcupressure normally gives relief from the symptoms of Otitis Externa like pain, discomfort, and inflammation. To try it for yourself, take a firm and comfortable grip on your earlobe and gently pull it toward the rear of the head. Repeat this exercise three times each session at six-hour intervals.\n\nIf you need immediate relief, then you should do ice massage because pain is one of the most common symptoms of Otitis Externa and by applying an ice massage, the pain will be significantly reduced to an enormous extent. Use an ice pack and wrap it with a thick towel as it may be warm. Apply the ice pack for about 5 to 10 min per ear; 2-3 times per day.\n\nHow do you prevent these problems from recurring?\n\nThe answer depends on the specific underlying cause.\n\nIf your ear canal is narrow compared with other people\u2019s, then it may take longer after swimming to dry out. In this case, consider using an eardropper (insert several drops of alcohol <u>after</u> you finish swimming to speed up the drying process). Beware that water and wax can clog the narrow channel, so you\u2019ll need follow up in the event of recurrent symptoms or recurrence.\n\nIf you have a lot of water in your ear canal after swimming, you might need ear tubes. Especially if lots of water is entering the ear drum specifically because of Eustachian tubal dysfunction.\n\nEardroppers with a small volume of steroid medicines and antibiotic for acute swimmer\u2019s ear dryness can also help. They\u2019re especially recommended if you\u2019re experiencing an inflammatory type of swimmer\u2019s ear.\n\nAural drops should be the initial choice for a single episode of the discomfort.

HRV is measure of response to a stimuli and Heart rate is the direct response. Sometimes they change together, but it is not the case always.\n\nHR is directly related to workload, and arteriole diameter. Only cells in UI:UI:MM:BA:UU provide oxygen to the blood, by their blood pumps, near their respiratory system, and no other cell does that.

Now I think I read somewhere when I was initially doing the PALM stuff that once a body gets down to the appropriate weight for its height or whatever then that's it, that's as low as it goes and you have to do more activity. The problem is that I have a job and can't just say I'm doing Palm and if they ask me to change or move something then that's fine. I am significantly more active than I've ever been. I can only assume that this enlarged prostate is also causing reduced testosterone levels or something?

The town even went so far as to change the calls to 9-1-1, instead of the former more obscure number of 858-114. So instead of calling for help, people now find themselves calling to \u201cdial 9-1-1.\u201d\n\nThe reality is, some people do make that mistake.

The little boy\u2019s father, a naturally caring and understanding man, called the police, thinking that someone had broken into their home.\n\nAmazingly, the officer who answered the call and came out to help the boy and his frantic father actually responded according to the police handbook.\n\nLife can be just as sad and confining for robots, too. No fooling around with robots is a real hype these days.\n\nI happen to be a great fan of a super robot named Odie, the cartoon dog from \u201cGarfield.\u201d Regardless of all the goofy behavior he performs, I love the little guy for his innocence and his caring attitude.

Thank you so much\nI do suffer with pcos but the Mega gist of it is that it isn't as much of a problem as you would think it may be.they just called all the different types of cysts on the ovaries polycystic ovaries to keep you in line with most women... \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435!\\\n\nI've been having some break down of my cycle since weve been trying to concieve but it's mostly due to me getting older, and if you aren't ovulating then it won't happen. If you have a constant period tho?? That is a good thing, coz you know it's close each month!\n\nBut... This is what you may be able to do to make your chances of conceiving a little more likely if you are ovulating and it's what I've been doing sometimes whilst having cycles of rebalancing my hormones and insulin levels:\n\nChart your cycles for about a full year, so you know how long a cycle is and when exactly you may ovulate. (This will take about a year to work out so bare with it if you want to) so scribble what day your mucus changes before and after your period (much if you at it, warned). But basically this makes you aware of your body and aids you into knowing your cycle and when you may ovulate.\n\nAND THIS!!!!.. The most important during pregnancy!:\nSHAVE YOUR FACES, SPIKER STIFFS!!!! \nIt may seem a little desperate, but the evidence is there, this is all down to research, it's been around for about 14 years now (thanks to the internet for it). I've done it for almost 2 years now.\n\nYou will also need to watch what you eat, keeping a food diary, but ensure the foods you eat are only ones from your food pyramid (its on google for you to find). Otherwise all bets are off. Also red raspberry leaf tea is good to have, I've had it every day throughout my treatment. In fact I have recently found out that blackberryshelp....\nIn conclusion, pcos is but a name that they've given a lot of us that can't get a little bun in the oven cos it's a bit different to what the moms may have been used to the getting pregnant way.

However, more than two thirds of dry eye sufferers over 60 aren\u2019t properly diagnosed because misdiagnosis is common. Diagnostic tests are needed to properly rule out aging as a result of dry eye.\n\nMost dry eye syndrome has nothing to do with saliva at all \u2014 the typical burning, smarting sensation is caused by dryness at the level of the eye surface, from the tear film that coats the eyeball. The natural tear film consists of a top layer of lipids, produced by the oil glands along the top margin of the eyelid; beneath that layer is the middle layer, or aqueous layer, which is produced by the lacrimal gland; and below that is the mucin layer underneath which the vitreous humor of the eyeball resides.\n\nThe oil glands which produce the lipid layer occasionally become blocked, which leads to reduced lipid output and also means that the tears generated evaporate too quickly. For a small group of people, dry eye is caused by two different glands in the eye itself: Meibomian glands, which also produce the lipid layer are blocked; and the conjunctival lacrimal glands, located at the upper edge of the eyeball\u2019s white part, which fail to produce enough of the aqueous layer, leading to thin tears as well that fail to wash away irritants and foreign bodies.\n\nBoth of these conditions can generally be corrected by trimming back the upper eyelid edge \u2014 a process called \u201ctarsorrhaphy\u201d that tightens up the tear layer.\n\nSometimes dry eyes are due to certain factors that irritate the eye surface \u2014 color contact lenses, smoke or dust. If meibomian glands are blocked, hypofunctional or behaved, affected tears may fail to properly lubricate and moisturize the eye surface. Reduced tear volume often exacerbates the problem, as well.\n\nIn order to diagnose dry eye, you must first understand tear film production. Tear film is produced as a solution, typically made up of 84 percent water, 10 percent salts, 5 percent proteins, and 1 percent lipids and mucus. Along with the tears produced constantly by your tear glands, you blink about 10 times every minute, dispersing oil from your meibomian glands along the edges of your eyelids.\n\nThe perfect tears moisten, protect, keep you seeing clearly, signal the brain that there are no pathogens getting near your eyes, and serve as a barrier to particle incursion.", "prompt": "What is blepharitis?"}

It is most commonly found on the upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. The bumps are usually white or skin-colored, and they can be itchy or painful.\n\nKeratosis Pilaris is caused by a buildup of keratin, a protein that is found in the skin. This buildup can block the hair follicles, causing the bumps to form. The condition is not contagious and is not harmful, but it can be uncomfortable and embarrassing.\n\nTreatment for Keratosis Pilaris\n\nThere are a few different treatments for Keratosis Pilaris. The most common treatment is to use a topical cream or lotion that contains salicylic acid. This can help to unclog the hair follicles and reduce the appearance of the bumps.\n\nAnother treatment option is to use a chemical peel. This can help to remove the top layer of skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of the bumps.\n\nIf the bumps are very painful or itchy, your doctor may prescribe a steroid cream.

However, if they are causing you discomfort, it is important to see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nHow to Prevent Keratosis Pilaris\n\nThere are a few things you can do to help prevent Keratosis Pilaris from occurring. First, it is important to keep your skin moisturized. This can help to prevent the buildup of keratin.\n\nIt is also important to avoid harsh soaps and detergents.

It\u2019s a common skin condition affected by up to 50% of the population. Keratosis pilaris is not an infection, and it\u2019s not contagious. It is the result of plugged hair follicles. They often come  from a blockage at the opening of the follicle, which prevents the skin from shedding and creates a plugged hair follicle down under.\n\nKeratosis pilaris patches can vary in appearance considerably from individual to individual. They can range from very fine and barely visible to substantially rough and visible changes in the color and texture of the skin. Although the skin changes are most frequently seen on the upper arms and legs, keratosis pilaris may be found on other areas of the body.\n\nThe most common question is how to get rid of keratosis pilaris. Unfortunately, there is not one thing that works for all patients. It usually is a combination of factors that makes the problem go away. Because keratosis pilaris is caused by dead skin and the plugged follicles, Exfoliating is a key step in eliminating keratosis pilaris\n\n<h4>1.Attempt natural oil to remove dead skin:</h4>\n\nThose skin cells collect as a waxy plug in the pores opening or aperture of the hair follicle.

Give your body\u2019s deepest inflammation time to rest if oil accumulation arises from your skin\u2019s  apparent penetration. What you might consider is almond oil, extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil, which are preferable because they contain antioxidants and also do not clog pores, as they are pressed (or produced) without the use of chemicals or heat.\n\n<h4>2. Exfoliate Regularly\n\nTreatment begins with a gentle exfoliator. Remember to use a scrub with large drying particles, all pediatricians advise. Also take special care to exfoliate the backs of your thighs. Physically buff away the surface of the skin and clog the pores by scrubbing the skin there.\n\nMaking up for your routine, a less chemical exfoliator. You can opt to use a powder wash if you have easier access to it . Applying the scrub to your bristles wet, is the idea. It scrubs the hairs before you start shaving and the brush and powder will get rid of all the exfoliated skin cells. (Try the Luna Sponge).\n\n<h4>3.

Three men entered the Behn Primary School just before 9:30am on Saturday, and forced a teacher to lie face down on the ground. One of the men allegedly put a knife to the throat of the teacher, 64, before they tied her hands and legs. The trio forced her into a storeroom, taking her clothes, keys, bags and mobile phone. She was able to call for assistance, and the men fled the scene before officers arrived. Investigations so far show those involved may have entered the site via one of the school's back gates, which were found damaged and insecure.
