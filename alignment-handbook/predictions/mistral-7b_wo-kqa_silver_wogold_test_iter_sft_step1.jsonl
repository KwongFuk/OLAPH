{"text": "Question: I take zyrtec for my allergies will hydroxyzine be ok to take with it? \n ### Answer: Can Zyrtec (cetirizine) be combined with hydroxyzine? Absolutely! In general, cetirizine for the histamine issues and hydroxyzine you like probably for the itching component.\n\nCan I mix Benedryl and hydroxyzine?\n\nMayo Clinic, however, warns that mixing diphenhydramine \u2014 the active ingredient in Benadryl \u2014 with hydroxyzine can cause unexpected and harmful side effects that are even more sedating. Some OTC sleep medications and cold medicines also contain multiple antihistamines, so be sure to check the label before use.\n\n### Why hydroxyzine hydrochloride 50mg vs hydroxyzine 10mg?\n\nIt\u2019s also available in both its brand-name forms of Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride Pamoate/Chlorate 50mg and Vistaril 10mg. They both work in the same way but differ in exactly what\u2019s in the preparation and the ultimately the way in which the body absorbs the medication.\n\nDoes hydroxyzine cause drowsiness?\n\nHydroxyzine is used to relieve itching or anxiety. Hydroxyzine works by blocking the effects of a certain chemical in the body (histamine).

{"text": "Question: Is that white spot not some kind of infection? \n ### Answer: What\u2019s causing this and what do I do about it?\n\nOver the counter (OTC) fluoride varnish, proper brushing and flossing, and routine professional cleanings provided by a pediatric dental specialist can greatly reduce the risk of white spots.\n\nDoes the child have white spots or chalky white patches on any of his or her teeth?\n\nIf so, they could be an indication of a previous infection. The two conditions that can cause white spots are fluorosis (excess fluoride consumption) and dental fluorosis (the result of enamel hypoplasia). White spot lesions can also result from the plaque on our teeth during decay. Eroding enamel roughly one third of the surface shows a darker shade allowing it to protect itself in hope to evolve itself into a mineralized defense; leading to a considerable erosion. This can happen on the inside, along the gum line on the upper area of the tooth. This can cause cavities and may worsen as long as the plaque remains without further treatment. Fluorosis is the reminence of fluoride consumption at higher quantities and crystallization during the forming and developing phases of teeth. Fluorosis can result in dental fluorosis. If the white spots and/or patches were caused by a tooth infection or fluorosis, they may clear up, or they may stay.\n\nWhat can you do to minimize white stains on kids teeth?\n\nYou must first practice preventive care at an early age to straighten your child\u2019s teeth and to eradicate their white spots in the Invisalign via Golden Brooke. To get started on that regimen schedule an appointment with KidsSmiles. They have a mildly invasive yet effective treatment for white stains on kids teeth. They will fit your child with a sticky gel that will infiltrate the white spot on the tooth by powdering up the white stains on kids teeth and make them less detectable and help them cover their teeth in time. Kid\u2019s Smiles may also apply laser angstrom or a laser which in essence produces a beam of bright light to painlessly remove and destroy decayed teeth and can help to fuse back the looking of your kid\u2019s teeth.\n\nHow do I know if my kid\u2019s teeth\u2019s white spots are from fluorosis?"}

This same thing happened to me over seven years ago during this time of year \u2013 except I didn\u2019t have a doubt in the world as to what it was.

{"text": "Question: Is there anything else I could take for the sinus pain? \n ### Answer: - Nigel\n\nNigel \u2026 first of all as a general point, it is much better to have no pain than to take another pain killer. Often, our drugs are fine in certain circumstances, but taken too frequently or used excessively, they can cause harm. Personally, I try to reduce and even eliminate pain dangerous drugs altogether. It is true that the passage of time can see this effect changed and this is why we use \u2018repetition rules\u2019, in an attempt to reduce antibiotic resistance. When it comes to pain, in my opinion, there can be significant benefits to reducing synthetic pain killers because the natural mechanisms of control of pain that the body has are very impressive. For example, there is a lovely cocktail of chemicals released at the time of massage and in the presence of anti-inflammatory diets or exercises such as yoga \u2013 these chemicals control pain and are safe. The last two sessions I have had at a spa have been absolutely wonderful \u2013 I would even go so far as to say, that it was a very nice and relaxing experience. I have wiped out the pain, and for me the spa treatments are so much better than just any patched up pain relief. I am certainly going to do that, and the best thing is that it is free for me too.\n\nTherefore, my answer to your question is quite short. Do not take any medicines, as I am always reluctant to let people take pain killers unless they genuinely need them. I did find one thing that is worth trying. It is called Acidophilus or Lactofil. These are not really natural relaxation therapies but they are certainly effective for sinus pain and they work faster and more reliably than nearly all other known techniques. Try these, as well as your relaxation treatments and breathe some fresh air through an air humidifier. If you are feeling a bit like your losing it, then try carrot juice instead as a drink. Do not take medicines that are for pain relief, as it is not even clear that these are beneficial for sinus pains \u2013 which are not really related to nerves anyway.\n\nBest wishes \u2026\n\nGeoff Wilkinson"}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything over the counter I could use to ease the burning sensation? \n ### Answer: Kakshi\n\nWhile burning is often reported as the most common symptom associated with psoriasis during natural sun light exposure, it is also, however, quite common for patients to say the painful sensation makes sunshine a more enticing prospect!\n\nWhat causes the burn?\n\nThe outer layer of the skin is made up of dead cells. If you have psoriasis, these cells multiply too quickly, blocking the skin pores. Rather than shedding from the skin like healthy skin cells, they form a silver or white scale to limit sunlight reaching the nerves beneath the skin. It is in the area below the scale, which gets inflamed, that causes the terrible pain.\n\nWhat makes the burn worse?\n\nThe assumption is that the burn is caused by burning skin cells leaving the nerve ending more vulnerable to the sun\u2019s damage. However, medical experts now say it is likely that the burning is caused by nerve endings in the underlying skin rather than affected skin cells. As skin is a poor conductor of heat it takes longer after leaving the sunshine to cool that the nerve endings deep below the affected skin.\n\nHow can we deal with the burn?\n\nProlonged, repeated exposure is usually the cause of the burning sensation, even when using very low doses of light therapy. It is also understood that if you are in the initial phases of psoriasis, this makes the pain worse. You can deal with the burning in a number of ways, from applying an aloe vera gel to ease the pain or creating a layer of petroleum jelly before exposure to help soothe and protect. It is also important to note that you should only continue exposure to the sun until the first signs of psoriasis become visible. The longer you stay in the sun, the more likely your psoriasis will erupt. The burn is also dependent on initial skin sensitivity, when you first start to treat psoriasis.\n\nSunlight is a natural healer and when used sensibly, can help you get back into life. Always PLEASE remember to stay safe in the sun\u2026!\n\nIf in doubt, speak to our Expert Advisory Team for more advice."}

Eye drops are the proper term to use for all kinds of drop product. Calling eye drops, \u201ctears\u201d or \u201cnatural tears\u201d is incorrect. If product is prescribed, it usually is because the eye is infected and the active ingredient works to kill the infection. Some effective eye drops are peppergrain/castor oil, lamaize, lynotic/hylagolan plus, Amoticin and gentamycin. Proparakaine (Novacaine) is also an effective anti-inflammatory eye drop.\n\nWhat symptoms should I look out for during any episode of pain?\n\nGrey-white or yellow-white mucus discharge should be reported as needing attention also. The amount should be such that you can\u2019t see through the eye, and excessive blinking, squinting or sneezing is noted. Unfortunately, people often self diagnose and help themselves with controversial products. Tearing and crusting of the eyelashes is often seen in this condition.\n\nWhen visiting my eye doctor, what important information or documentation should I bring with me?\n\nIt is very helpful knowing a history of symptoms. These can usually be remembered by an elder. Be sure to note if you are on other medications. It is surprising how many are taken independently, without any warnings on the effects. For instance, Lunesta is known to require cornea dilating drops to be able to see correctly and safely after taking the medication. Other medications can increase eye pressure and cause vision difficulty, blurred vision or sensitivity to light.\n\nWhat other medical conditions or views should I inform my eye doctor about?\n\nPeople with high blood pressure could have less blood flow to the eye and therefore be more prone to eye disease if medications aren\u2019t managed effectively. In order to see well, blood pressure medication should be taken otherwise it can affect refraction. A long-term vision chart history is important\nto follow for a comparison record. I later discovered an interesting place to be able to get vision charts from charge-free for my elderly clients, thanks to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Thinking about and exploring how the foods you are eating affect your digestive system is helpful and can go a long way into alleviating a lot of this stuff, or for more serious issues, you can find a gastroenterologist to help.\n\nIn terms of what to try on your own though - and again, these things can be incredibly insightful - eliminating certain foods can be super helpful, even as temporary approach. Since it is a digestive issue, I would lean towards vegetables - these can be easy to digest and harder for your body to actually breakdown. Nevertheless, some veggies like asparagus, broccoli, and the like (cruciferous vegetables) are harder to digest, and boiling them can make them easier to digest. There are also some common foods that tend to exacerbate irritable bowel syndrome symptoms (which can contribute to stomach pain etc): lactose, coffee/caffeine, fibre etc. It's pretty common and bizarre, but I know people who can eat a ton of vegetables all day and feel perfectly fine, while their little sister has IBS, so loses the veggies - it's not unheard of, and the fact that we're individuals and have different responses is a good thing when you really look at it.\n\nomepping heartburn menthly\n\nSaltine cracker\n\nBut even if you like fruits/veggies, there can be too much fiber (sometimes.

{"text": "Question: Is the acetaminophen supposed to help with the achiness? \n ### Answer: How about the propranolol?\n\nNew patients to our Philadelphia dermatology practice frequently inquire about itchy scalp. Itchiness occurs due to a number of common conditions, including dermatitis, psoriasis, lice, scabies, pityriasis capitis (commonly referred to as dandruff) and even sensitive skin. In this post, we will discuss the last category of itchiness: sensitive skin.\n\nThere are many possible reasons that lead to an itchy or flaky scalp that does not occur from a specific disease state or condition. An insidious dandruff or some left over residue from a hair product is the cause in some cases, however some of the most common causes are heat from the hair dryer or hair straightener. Additionally, pollution, harsh chemicals, chronic sweating, and sometimes even the shampoo or wash detergents themselves may also be the cause of sensitive scalp.\n\nIf you are currently suffering from sensitive or itchy skin that is not from a condition or disease state, it is recommended that you attempt to alleviate the symptom by altering a previous few daily habits. Following are a few suggestions that may help you keep your itch under control:\n\n-  rising the hair dryer temperature below maximum or turning it off once a drying extensions is obtained\n\n-  implements a similar transition with the hair straightener\n\n-  try to use natural, organic or eco-friendly products with all natural ingredients rather than over the counter brands. These are generally free of excess perfumes that can lead to irritation\n\n-  shampoo or wash regularly. The more frequently the conditioner, shampoo, or conditioner is used the more likely the scalp is to become irritated\n\n-   when applying hair products to wet hair, avoid at all costs spraying eye shelves or ears.\n\nIf you have tried these common home remedies and are still suffering from a stubborn and sensitive skin problem, consider scheduling a consultation. A board\u2013certified dermatologist can determine the cause and offer a personalized treatment plan that works for you."}

Instead, take lots of fluids. Ensure that the stools are easy in passage and not hard.\n\nAt the same time, avoid junk or canned/bottled foods. Do not take anything that worsens the symptoms. Consume fruits like avocado instead.\n\nA high fiber diet is not recommended for people with diverticular disease.

{"text": "Question: Okay is irritation of the nerve treatable or permanent damage? \n ### Answer: Have you been irritated by your nerves recently? Some people have problems with their nerves over a long period of time. Eventually, it becomes a lot worse and gets to the point where it\u2019s really disturbing. They can start to complain of pain. If the nerves are bothering you, it requires a lot of medical help, and only your doctor knows how to get you better. Let us take a look at how to handle your nerve irritation, and how this relates to your toes.\n\nYour Body\n\nNerve Irritation: Your entire body will react to your nerves if they are working right, but only one part will be problematic when they\u2019re not. Your toes are a very common example of this. A nerve in your leg is the culprit in this case. It affects your toes because it easily gets to them by following the nerves down to the bottom of your legs. You can find yourself with constant pain in your toes or have foot drop which affects the way you walk. If pain persists it could eventually spread to other areas of your body, but you should notice something unusual immediately.\n\nYour Toes: Or foot drop obviously have other symptoms besides pain. If you suffer from the foot drop, you may have trouble walking on any surface. This is another common problem tied to irritated nerves. This just means they don\u2019t work the way anyone wants them to in these cases. So if you, for example, have foot drop-it will turn out that you most likely suffer from irritated nerves at least in one of your legs. You want to be cautious, though, because the nerve damage can get worse.\n\nWhat Else Happens: When your nerves are damaged, you probably won\u2019t experience just one problem, in most cases there are actually more than one. Unfortunately, this may affect nerves in other areas of your body or, in fact, elsewhere in the same leg. You could, in fact, suffer permanent damage that stops your nerves from working. It\u2019s going to be challenging to deal with nerve irritation, but you want to try and do some good research to ensure you know how best to handle your condition. You want to talk to experts like your doctor.\n\nYour Treatment: There are a good number of medications that can help you deal with nerve irritation. Your toes or your feet may be one area affected, but it could be worse and you may be feeling it all over your body. There"}

{"text": "Question: what about antibiotics? \n ### Answer: So now that you are unconvinced that asthma inhalers are simply metered-dose inhalants, it is time to dispense with the belief that asthma inhalers are safe or effective. Asthma inhaler safety and effectiveness are two separate questions, but they are related in that the safest and most effective asthma inhaler is often the one that is the safest and most effective. There are many benefits to using medical asthma inhalers, and they are not just for those who have asthma. Disadvantages to Using Medical Asthma Inhalers With asthma inhalers, you do not have to worry about the side effects that you would face if you used inhalers for other conditions, such as sinus and cold symptoms. The medical inhalers contain the same albuterol medication that is in your nasal spray, but is better absorbed into your system and has a faster onset of action. Cost is the other major consideration with asthma inhalers. The cost of medical inhalers may be higher than the cost of generic or other inhalers, because the generic inhalers tend to be cheaper than the brand name asthma inhalers. The main reason for that is simply because asthma inhalers are harder to make. The cost of the inhaler itself is really not a great consideration when it comes to whether you will use an inhaler or not. You would be surprised how many people think they must get the most expensive inhaler out there just because they want to feel like they are doing something good. This is true, though, because the inhaler that you buy will have a better chance of being the one that works for you. Making the Plans for Asthma Inhalers In the switch purdue pharmacy from over-the-counter asthma inhalers to an all natural form of medication, you will need to make some changes. First, get rid of your old asthma inhalers, and purchase a prescription-strength inhaler.\n\nYou need to be careful with what you mix and match, and how you mix and match, in order to make sure that you will not injure yourself or make your asthma symptoms worse. The other asthma inhalers available today at your local pharmacy and on the Internet can be mixed up with the"}

{"text": "Question: do you think d-mannose is a good way to try and fight the infection? \n ### Answer: Named_Pyromancer wrote:\nKolash wrote:\ndo you think d-mannose is a good way to try and fight the infection?\n\nI don't really have any data or experience to support this, but the mechanism d-mannose works on reminds me of the mechanism penicillin works on. D-mannose sticks to E. coli in a way it sticks to host cells, so it causes E. coli to self-destruct through a process called autolysis (see this video for more - it starts to get interesting around 12:01). Penicillin, on the other hand, works by preventing the E. coli from being able to build the cell wall that keeps it together - once the cell wall is gone, E. coli also self-destructs through autolysis.\n\nI'm no expert in microbiology, so please don't treat my explanations above as gospel. I think d-mannose is also antibacterial, and there are some studies that suggest d-mannose could discourage E. coli from developing antibiotic resistance during treatment..\n\nHere is a recent study on the topic.\n\nHere is another.\n\nThey seem to be a little mixed, in one example, d-Mannose helped eradicate it (around 25% of the time for one more severe case), but in the other it didn't seem to be helpful."}

{"text": "Question: Cyclobenzaprine? \n ### Answer: What\u2019s that?\n\nWelcome to the JBY Blog, where we\u2019re happy to answer any questions you may have about pain, fitness, recovery, and physical therapy. Cyclobenzaprine really isn\u2019t all that obscure; the drug, Flexeril belongs to the piperidine family of muscle relaxers that act on muscles to produce overall body-wide relaxation.\n\nWhy do we believe in using anti-inflammatory medication? Because there is a lot of data that shows that decreasing inflammation leads to less pain. This is why when you apply heat for injury, for example, often the pain will begin to diminish, because the pain itself is linked to inflammation.\n\nIn addition to its efficacy as a muscle relaxant, there\u2019s really not a lot else about cyclobenzaprine that you will love. The drug is a tricyclic antidepressant, which carries with it a good number of potential side effects. Now, it is important to point out that adverse side effects were found in preliminary trials occurring only in the elderly population. This is due to the decrease in brain chemistry that occurs with aging and means that the side effects are more common with the use of this drug in the elderly population. Some, but not all, reported side effects included:\n\n- Dryness of the mouth\n- Constipation\n- Dizziness\n- Drowsiness\n- Drowsiness, excessive so as to impact one\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery\n- Increased blood pressure or a slight increase\n- Blurry vision\n- Heart palpitations\n- Confusion\n\nAdditionally, the overdose of cyclobenzaprine can cause serotonin syndrome and high body temperature which can be fatal. If you have bladder problems, increased blood pressure, heart issues, or any allergies, you should speak with your doctor before taking Flexeril or another cyclobenzaprine.\n\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush, though; the biggest risk with Flexeril is its addictive qualities. Flexeril belongs to the same chemical family as phencyclidine, or PCP, a drug that has hallucinatory qualities. Because of this, Flexeril has the potential to be abused and can be addictive. Misuse can result in seizures and"}

{"text": "Question: Is it contagious? \n ### Answer: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an inherited illness that causes episodes of inflammation in the body. It is most often seen in people of Middle Eastern or Asian descent, but people of any ethnic origin can be affected. Altogether, FMF is thought to have a prevalence of about one in 1000 people.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of FH?\n\nNo one with FMF is identical. One person may only have difficulty hearing due to the illness while another person may have fainting episodes or stomach (abdominal) pain, or spells of high temperature (fever) and rapid heart rate.  Usually, there are periods of good health and periods of symptoms. Some people have only mild symptoms and others have severe attacks regularly. Attacks usually last a few hours or days and some people can be attacked numerous times in a week while others attack only once or twice per year.\n\nHow is FH inherited?\n\nFMF is unusual in that almost everyone who is affected has a family member also affected. The gene for FMF was first identified in 1997 and research continues in this area. The gene responsible for FMF makes a protein called pyrin. Defects in this gene allow protein produced by the gene to be produced abnormally which changes the way the body\u2019s cells react to signals from the nervous system. This over-reaction leads to the symptoms of FMF.\n\nThe severity of FMF tends to vary between families and between different members of one family. For this reason, it is thought that the illness needs two defective copies of the gene to be severe. Most attacks of FMF occur when there are two defective copies of the gene (homozygous affecteds). Even when there is only one defective copy of the gene (heterozygous affecteds), symptoms can still cause trouble, but they are usually less serious. As most individuals with FMF have 1 or 2 changes in the gene, there is a 1 in 4 chance that a child of an affected parent will get FMF.\n\nWhat is the diagnosis?\n\nThe diagnosis rests on the medical history, examination and repeated inflamed periods strongly suggestive of FMF. Diagnosis is complicated if the person is taking anti-inflammatory drugs for another cause \u2014 especially if the patient has had all their symptoms since the"}

{"text": "Question: Is there a medication (eye drop) over the counter that you recommend to alleviate the pressure and redness while it heals? \n ### Answer: It is okay to use some lubricating drops, such as Refresh, Tears Naturale or Systane, if your eyes are feeling dry and irritated. Because these products only lubricate and do not address the inflammation (redness/irritation), they may not be enough when used alone; however, they can provide some comfort during the healing phase. You should also restart your lifecore shearwind. I suggest using this in conjunction with artificial tears to help reduce both discomfort and inflammation."}

{"text": "Question: If its an allergy, will it go away on its own? \n ### Answer: A true allergy is not likely to go away, but it is possible.   True allergies are your body\u2019s reaction to something it believes to be harmful or dangerous, so the best thing to do would be to avoid that substance as much as possible. Being able to pinpoint what foods your dog is all allergic too can sometimes be challenging.  If you want to pinpoint the root cause of the allergic reaction then it would be best to take your dog into Dr.Express and perform blood tests which will normally cost you between $100 - $200.  An allergy test takes six to eight weeks to get those results because the body takes time to frame an antibody response.  Your dog doesn\u2019t have to have direct skin contact with the allergen, they can breathe it in, and inhale the allergens too.  This is why the allergies are so difficult to determine.\n\nHow can I communicate with my dog that someone is allergic to him\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand how the allergy symptoms manifest themselves.  Symptoms may include a runny nose, itchy skin, rash, chronic sinusitis, chest pain, or asthmatic breathing. While these symptoms may seem like the health is in jeopardy they aren\u2019t, and if someone is placed on watch to ensure early intervention if symptoms worsen then the symptoms can be reasonably catered to.  How to do this is beyond the scope of this article but most parents understand that beyond not allowing your pet near others that they know are allergic they should take additional precaution by not letting them sleep in the same room.  It is not the only way, but the most common things are to recognize what symptoms present and therefore to remedy them ensuing a visit to a doctor as needed.  Traditional methods of pets getting sick by being warm enough to sleep with their pet, or by laying on top of when the natural body heat is generated.  There are some instant remedies for the symptoms if they can be remedied.  Not all situations require a visit to the doctor and if this is the case please ask a local vet for advice itself on any non-critical emergency."}

{"text": "Question: Can i replace Naproxen by paracetamol? \n ### Answer: Naproxen slows chemical signals in the body, which would normally tell nerve cells to send pain messages to the brain. Naproxen can only replace paracetamol, as this drug alone will not produce anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nIs Naproxen same as Tylenol? Naproxen (the active ingredient in Aleve) is a prescription-strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory that also reduces fever and pain. Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, is anti-inflammatory pain and fever reducer.\n\nHow do you flush out Naproxen? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you can help flush these chemicals out of your system by going for 72 hours without eating, drinking, or breastfeeding. Or at least, as long as is possible for you. Decreasing food, drink, and ice consumption will help your blood dilute and flush out the chemicals.\n\nDoes advil make you gain weight? Naproxen won\u2019t cause you to gain weight, but it can cause you to retain water, so you will look heavy. Gastritis is caused as a result of over the counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen. You can have a flare up of gastritis (stomach ulcers) any time you take these drugs."}

{"text": "Question: That all makes sense, is it normal for viral pink eye to have gooey exudate and yellow crust around the eyes? \n ### Answer: Massachusetts Methamphetamine Initiative\n\n***The following comments are not official AAP recommendations and should not be construed as such.***\n\nViral pink eye, once thought to be caused by an airborne virus, is in fact catarrhal conjunctivitis due to a specific virus, Herpes simplex virus. Although the true incidence of this infection in children is unknown, the vast majority of cases are self-limited 1-2 week processes (Ghostine & Berg, 1993). For those cases not meeting this timeline, consultation with the infectious disease physician may be appropriate. Some studies suggest that the use of topical fluconazole is helpful for these more severe Herpes simplex cases, but definitive, controlled studies are lacking (Szollosi, 1995). Although topical antibiotics do not have a role in the initial infection, they are often helpful with some of the complications of virus infection, such as conjunctivitis or corneal ulcer."}

I take rexulti which is an antipshencotic psychiatristck drug...i am on 48mg of rexulti...24 mg twice a day. And i take 1mg of klonopin. So I was prescribed this on ond from my dr who works at a neuropsychology department who's my doctor. The approximate dose for a high functioning adult is between 20-60 mg daily...which I know is quite a bit. I might stick with 60 mg...like i said, i'm just trying to avoid any side effects. The side effects are causing my anxiety to go through the roof. I'm not paranoid though, i know to a degree how the buprocione works..they work on certain receptors in the brain. I was suggested this case it can relax me...ive tried sooooo many other drugs. 7 years after ive been experimenting with medication...whatever works im ready to take it. It's also possible that I probably needed a higher dose to to function normally...I dont know. I assume i dont have many side effect options left in my life that cant come with trying to be mentally healthy. So, wish me luck if anyone approaches this issue in any way! \ufffd\nThanks for reading..."}
{"text": "Question: Is there a type of brace or splint that would help it rest at night? \n ### Answer: In brief, what you are causing when you injure the rotator cuff. A combination of medical and non-invasive treatment options is available, such as corticosteroid and ice packs.\n\nBut, in the 90s, there were more options available for rotator cuff injuries. The protocols for repairing a torn or deficient rotator cuff also gave the patient an option for arthroscopic surgery and tenodesis.\n\nA comprehensive and thorough health care plan is required if you have been diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury, no matter how severe. Included in this plan are X-rays, evaluations, non-invasive plans, physical therapy, and surgical possibilities.\n\nKeywords: rotator cuff injury, rotator cuff surgery, surgery for rotator cuff tear.\n\n## What Is Rotator Cuff Injury?\n\nMore than one person can move around because of the muscles in the rotator cuff. If the rotator cuff is present, foremost, a person can bring their hands in and behind the head. Like hockey players who throw pucks, the rotator cuff also impacts the overhand throwing mechanisms. It\u2019s also a common source of both of shoulder pain and recurrent injuries.\n\nThe rotator cuff treatments of the distal border of the shoulder blade attach to the top of the curl. Broads\u2019 muscles also comprise four distinct muscles, divided into different tendons.\n\nTo fully repair the rotator cuff\u2019s covering requires all four parts to be reconnected.\n\nThe tendons then connect to swiftly respond and perform the deformity\u2019s quickest improvement.

Probably probiotics can work in many ways.\n\nIs kombucha a probiotic?\n\nScientists are just beginning to understand the effect of probiotics in kombucha, but you can expect that there is at least some helpful bacteria in your drink.

Your tube and feces are saturated with yeast which is the home of candida albicans. Candida is harmless when there are other strong bacteria.\n\nProbiotics can sometimes help people with conditions that cause an imbalance of bacteria, including bacterial vaginosis. Studies suggest that some B vitamins (specifically Lactobellosis) may also help prevent or accelerate a yeast infection.\n\n## Can probiotics be harmful?\n\nPeople commuting should stop: If you have an immune disorder and have serious illnesses, should not use probiotics. Also, people taking probiotics can have gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and may have more gas and bloating in the abdominal area.\n\nSpecific probiotics in some people also make the digestive system worse. Because of serious side effects, probiotics can disagree. Probiotics added with antibiotics were not well liked by people. As always, talk to your health care provider before you start any new dietary supplement or supplement."}

{"text": "Question: Are there any topical scar treatments available? \n ### Answer: Although the scar is a remnant of a formerly traumatic wound, it must be kept in mind, that the formation of a scar is a natural process, partly unavoidable and limited constructive positive impact, which can improve the appearance of the scar. The different factors for the development and colour of a scar are inter alia:\n\nthe size of the original lesion, the depth of the original wound, the immediate and correct treatment of the wound, the material used to heal the wound (eg., stitching or cutting), the availability of blood supply in the wound area and, last but not least, genetic predisposition.\n\nStill, wound cares with silicone sheeting and other adhesive mediums can improve scar appearance. Silicone sheeting therapy is available for skin care, surface application treatment, and at night time (rely on its own adhesion). They have to be applied directly after the sterilisation of the skin. Those must also be continuously replaced by sterile ones, at the frequency indicated by the physiotherapist.\n\nSilicone preparations are also have heart valves or implantable devices been injectable substances for that can be used with a causal treatment.\n\nIt is important, however, that depending on the skin type and the symptoms they are applied.\n\nIf your scar is older than 1 year, it might have more fibre-like consistency than a wound with narrower and more ribbon-like appearance. Scars can be elongated, wide, in the form of the segment can be blobky. It is not recommended that you should cooperate preserving scars in a different phase of formation and ageing by use of scissors. Allow that this patient can only be of cosmetic use fully meaningful later on.\n\nYou can use scar treatment which is internationally recognised for aesthetic surgery. Although it has only cosmetic effect on existing scars, but can complement any treatment above (silicone creams) especially in preparation for surgery. Thus medical drug store scar therapy products in a single category can be for both prevention and treatment of scars.\n\nThe surgical procedure using laser technology, fillers, fat transplantation (to compensate the major manufacturing perfectly) or other options may also be used."}
{"text": "Question: Is it contagious? \n ### Answer: No, it is not contagious.\n\nIs it genetic?\n\nIt is caused by a hereditary abnormality of one, or more, genes, and every person with haemophilia is born with it. It can occur in any male of any ethnicity, but is more frequently seen in Caucasian males than in other ethnic groups.\n\nIt is now known that the vast majority of haemophilia A cases are caused by a mutation in a single gene called F8. The F8 gene is situated on the X chromosome of all men. The abnormality in the gene prevents the platelet proteins in the blood from being manufacture correctly. The result is a lack of functional coagulation factor in the blood stream.\n\nRare cases of genetic variation (polymorphisms) in the F8 gene, which do not interrupt DNA production, have been reported, these are called \u2018\u00ed+\u2019 mutations and do not result in haemophilia[1].\n\nIn 2007, the US based National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) published a paper summarising findings from haemophilia research around the world: \"Nearly two-thirds of the known mutations of F8 and approximately 80 % of the recorded cases of haemophilia A could be explained by variation at less than 10 hotspots within the gene\". \"Nine variants account for 53% of severe haemophilia, 88% of moderate haemophilia, and 86% of mild haemophilia.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that these common variants present in patients with all grades of haemophilia may provide useful biomarkers for severity of disease, response to therapy and inhibitor development. They are also excellent targets for therapy as most would not tolerate the consequences of a random mutation in the F8 gene.\n\nAs new alleles/mutations are identified often, especially in patients, it is essential to keep up-to-date information on the subject collected in a centralized database. The World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH), in collaboration with healthcare professionals and industry, has established the Haemophilia High Throughput Sequencing Collaborative (HHTSC) database; a collaboration of researchers to share information from all patients."}

{"text": "Question: I had my gallbladder removed in 2015, so that rules out gallstones, right? \n ### Answer: Wrong. Chinese Medicine tells a different story: any stone in the digestive tract is clearly related to something that is currently or formerly stuck.\n\nLiving with an irritated gallbladder, especially after surgery (which does not heal it, it has only had the stone removed), means each meal you eat is a hit or miss. Further, adding to the complication is that many of today\u2019s meals are eating out, at the mercy of whatever the restaurants cook. In some cases, it is making a case that the meals are not \u201cheart friendly,\u201d as they can lead to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nEvery time I take off, I analyze my options first. It is not that I am anti-eating out and hate to cook, which would comprise two of my three pleasures. But in reality, there are a number of people who depend on me and I am answerable to several.\n\nMy pleasures in life are:\n\n- Cooking\n- Baking\n- Writing\n\nCooking and eating in moderation keeps me sane. But whether I use a heating bag or a hot heating pad when I sit, it doesn\u2019t stop the disruption at the end of my gallbladder ducts, where gallstones are not unheard of, since it was removed. It took going to a Chinese Medicine doctor to know the store of my problems.\n\nUnnoticed gallstones are considered normal; only when they are in an area that they disrupt the general forward flow of the ducts, does it become a problem. And that is located either where the gallbladder meets the common bile duct, or where the common bile duct meets the pancreatic duct. That\u2019s the point, where the gallbladder stones, when there are any present, can cause the entire duct system to be inflamed. Treatment for inflamed ducts? Eat foods that are sweet, whether they are protein or carbohydrates.\n\nWhat kind of fruits are those?\n\n1. Bananas\n2. Persimmons\n3. Zucchinis* (both the big and the little ones)\n4. Dates\n5.

Is it better to have a isolated, strictly prescribed first round of antibiotics over? Longer, with multiple drs and people giving you random pill to get rid of cdx.\n\nObviously, it is more difficult to take multiple classes of antibiotics since it is much harder for the body to go through a deeper infection with multiple lesions, and through multiple organs.

{"text": "Question: My ears crackle constantly when I swallow is that due to the congestion? \n ### Answer: I have a cold and my ears crackle constantly when I swallow. Is that due to the congestion?\n\n## Answer\n\nThe crackling sound you hear when you swallow is called crepitus. It is caused by the movement of air through the Eustachian tube. The Eustachian tube is a small tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat. It helps to equalize the pressure in the middle ear.\n\nWhen you have a cold, the Eustachian tube can become blocked by mucus. This can cause the pressure in the middle ear to build up. When you swallow, the pressure in the middle ear is released and the air moves through the Eustachian tube. This causes the crackling sound.\n\nThe crackling sound is usually not a cause for concern. It will usually go away on its own as the cold improves. If the crackling sound is accompanied by other symptoms, such as ear pain or hearing loss, you should see a doctor."}

{"text": "Question: H pylori could also be a culprit? \n ### Answer: Used for mending hearts, liver, digestive and respiratory system diseases, licorice root is one of the most effective herbs to cure peptic ulcers. Ancient Greeks and Egyptians used it as an antibacterial and anti-parasitic remedy. It has been included in Chinese traditional medicine formulas for many centuries. Pharmaceutical preparations of licorice root are available commercially and are used as over the counter medicine.\n\nToday, licorice root is known to be a remedy for poor adrenal function and is often needed in cortisol and other steroid creams to make it effective. It also contains glycyrrhizic acid helps heal stomach and intestinal lesions. Modern research has discovered the active phytochemicals in licorice can help brain cell regrowth and prevent dementia. Can it also help protect the heart? Researchers infected rat\u2019s liver cells with Hepatitis-C virus in test tubes. They determined that several metabolites in licorice root extract reduced viral replication, inhibiting viral reproduction. Other phytochemicals in licorice root extract prevented the virus from entering the host cell. The phytochemicals which had antiviral effects are luobuphenol A, lupeol and alpha-amyrin.\n\nThere has been research suggesting that licorice tea can help inhibit the growth of hepatitis B and C. There is encouraging news that traditional licorice root has had some germ busting activity that could help treat peptic ulcers and stomach ulcer. H Pylori, is a bacterium related to stomach ulcers. Research indicates 90% of peptic ulcers have a bacterium present. On the other hand, most people with the H. pylori bacteria do not develop ulcers. The role of H Pylori in the development of peptic ulcers has been the topic of much research. Some research suggests that Pylori helps prevent ulcers in those at high risk. However, sometimes it does increase stomach mucosal permeability making it more likely for other pathogens, such as helminthes, to invade the tissue. Although it is a common component of some sandwiches, herbal teas, candies, and other foods, it has potential toxic effects."}

{"text": "Question: Whats a muscle relaxer? \n ### Answer: Skeletal muscle is not a simple motion that is triggered by the central might by our mind. For example, when you are hitting a ball then your elbow muscles need muscular tension in order to get control with the ball.\n\nThere are a variety of muscles in between bones, tendons ligaments along with connective flesh that permit the body to move. Your muscles are composed of specialized cells that attach muscles to bones and move together. Exactly how the brain sends out messages to the muscles in the form of neurotransmitters depends on the particular muscles.\n\nNerve Endings\n\nA muscle can\u2019t relocate without having it is nerve endings. Without nerve endings that send out emotionally activated signals to the brain, you can\u2019t walk, kiss, type or do it at any kind of points. The nerves in your muscles will certainly communicate muscle tension to a level as little as one-one hundredth of a millimeter across, which will certainly help to offer the body easy movements.\n\nMotor nerves get in touch with the brain via your very first motor neuron, which attaches to the alpha motor nerve that gets in touch with and also stimulates the muscle. Alpha motor nerve cells or nerve cell and muscle cell that generates and also speeds electro-chemical nerve signals depending on neurotransmitters to change into muscle mass electro-chemical energy.\n\nBasically, neurotransmitters attach nerve cells as well as the specific muscle cells that go on to be transform electro-chemically and muscular tissue impulses, to contract muscles for desired body movements. So neurotransmitters and chemicals are what inserts nerve signals to the specific muscle tissues in order for the body to move.\n\nExactly how it Works and Why it\u2019s Complicated\n\nYou might have read this as well as asked the question, \u2018how does it work?\u2019 Neurotransmitters get in contact with a doubtful brain locus coeruleus as well as transmit signals to various locations of muscle cells creating electrical energy discharges throughout numerous places of the whole body: hip versus leg against your back etc.\n\nThe location of the body impacts exactly how those chemical signals get in touch with muscle mass and also you need hormones, dopamine, adrenal and transmission to exist in specific neuronal guidelines, in order to make a signal, for an activity to occur.

{"text": "Question: Is there a muscle relaxer I can take to at least alleviate the pain? \n ### Answer: [Carthage, Mo.]\n\nAnswer: Muscle relaxers can be divided into skeletal and smooth muscle relaxants. Each type of muscle relaxer works differently. Skeletal muscle relaxers work by acting directly in the nerve pathways, although your doctor may never tell you this. Early skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g., orphenadrine, carisoprodol) were non-selective, acting on other parts of your body as well. Skeletal muscle relaxers work by decreasing the amount of nerve impulses sent from your brain to your muscles.\n\nSmooth muscle relaxers are a different group of drugs and are not intended to ease skeletal muscle pain or strain. They act primarily on smooth muscle in the stomach and the intestine and are called anticholinergics. However, they also can relax the muscles of the bladder, bronchi, and uterus.\n\nSince pain is considered a secondary problem caused by muscle spasm, physicians often prescribe these drugs hoping that they will ease muscle spasms. The typical dosage of skeletal muscle relaxers is three divided doses; however, this varies and your doctor should tell you the dosage and administration schedule that is best for you. Side effects can be variable for all these drugs, particularly if you're on more than one. The most common problems are drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea and problems with vision and hearing. Older adults are usually much more sensitive to these drugs and side effects are more likely to occur in that particular group. These effects are more pronounced with alcohol and can lead to injury.\n\nOne drawback to all the prescription skeletal muscle relaxers (except carisoprodol) is a propensity toward causing habituation or psychological and physical dependence. Other side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, restlessness, insomnia, impairment, and intensification of both daytime and nighttime drowsiness. Better choices for back problems would be aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen (inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme). Effects on fibrous tissue are minimal with NSAIDs (although not zero), and they do have an effect on inflammation.\n\nUpdated August 10, 2011"}

Yet, the snots that are expelled from your nose can sometimes be paired with odors that are sometimes foul-smelling. This is because the mucus is supposed to smell even at the beginning. If the smell of the mucus changes, then it signals an abnormality somewhere in the nasal passage.\n\nMost people are complaining about white blood cells, and these white blood cells are capable of fighting infections.\n\nThese white blood cells in the mucus or areas where white blood cells should be in your nose will expel the scents that are actively fighting the bacteria that are making their way up.\n\nNasal passage/ nasal cavity might have some health concerns that can be referred to the eyes as well.

Attached to the image is the answer!\n\nWhat can cause an ovary to bleed for no reason? It can cause the ovarian cysts to increase in size and become more painful. However, if the cyst is filled with pus, your ovaries can seem somewhat normal until it starts to rupture. Then, the ovaries may develop an enlarged, painful cyst or cystic mass called an ovarian follicle.\nIt can also cause ovarian cysts and cysts that form on the skin of the abdomen and other parts of the body.

However, this time can be many months or even years before symptoms appear depending on the color of your skin.  Therefore, those from tropical areas are at the highest risk.\n\nCould someone have Lyme disease and still test negatively for Lyme?

I believe that approximately 20 \u2013 25 percent of all people suffering from fibromyalgia have Lyme.\n\nThe screening test for Lyme disease must be backed by another test that complements it.  One test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \u2013 ELISA.  This is a 90 \u2013 95 percent sensitive but not any specific test for Lyme disease.  If someone tests negative on the ELISA test, then the Weil-Felix delayed reaction test has a grain less, 80 \u2013 90 percent antigen-antibody detection.  The second test is the test of choice.  Both of these tests are subject to whether the Lyme bacteria is any longer present in the patient\u2019s body.\n\nT them are classified as a detection test, not a screening test, since detection requires the predisplacement of the pathogen as with Lyme.\n\nIf someone has been diagnosed with Lyme and treated with an antibiotic, have shown adequate serums, and developed too severe side effects for continued treatment do you suggest Intermittent"}

{"text": "Question: So an antibiotic would not help? \n ### Answer: Even if I took it too close to the vaccine?\n\nby Jeremy G\n\nAntibiotics are a treatment for BOTH bacterial and viral infections. It is not limited to simply bacterial. Some of the ways they can address a viral infection is either fighting the infection itself, fighting the inflammation the infection causes, or by helping the body in its overall attempt to heal itself.\n\nI think you are dealing with a lot of information and you might be missing some important points. For example, there are a lot of BORRELIOUS infections (tick infections) that can\u2019t be detected clinically. You are probably looking at something more like Borreliosis (Lyme or co-infection) as opposed to something like Lyme. Also, vaccines do not prevent infection \u2013 they prevent illness. That is important to understand. Furthermore, antibiotics do not prevent infection, they do not cause illness in the long run and are not associated with the development of autoimmune disease in humans.\n\nAn antibiotic targeted for borrelial infection can even help against co-infections like babesia and ehrlicha, especially the multi systemic infections like morgellons \u2013 most doctors are not seeing this because they do not yet know how to do it. They\u2019re simply not well informed.\n\nThe most common antibiotics that most doctors use to treat borrelial infection are Cefuroxime, Doxycycline, Amoxicillin, and Ceftriaxone. None of these are broad spectrum, which means they do not work on every potential deficiency \u2013 Aminoglycosides is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is not approved for human use. The reason for this that there are so many other more powerful antibiotics and the aminoglycosides are limited because too many have died because they killed the good bacteria too, allowing opportunistic organisms to take hold in areas below the bladder.\n\nFor a multi systemic Morgelons infection, the algorithm will be:\n\n- Oral antibiotics, locally\n- iv / iv component\n- intradermal component\n- oral component\n- keeping inflammation low (minimize risk of cytokine storms)\n- reduce free radicals\n- appropriate metal detoxification\n\nAnother thing to note is that some of"}

I can tell you how I interpreted your question, and if I understand it correctly you are trying to figure out if taking Bactrim will prevent you from becoming pregnant sometime in the future. Bactrim is an antibiotic that is sometimes used to treat sexually transmitted diseases (STD\u2019s) and urinary tract infections (UTI\u2019s). It has not been noted that it can cause interruption of the menstrual cycle, changes in menstrual bleeding pattern or delay in ovulation. STD\u2019s and UTI\u2019s can cause endometriosis, but after you take Bactrim it should not cause you to have any problems becoming pregnant in the future because it does not contain the kind of hormones that prevent ovulation like birth control pills do.\n\nYou may still need to think very carefully about this before starting any antibiotics you do have questions about. In the future if you have questions about any medications that you are to take you should discuss this with your doctor. If he agrees, he will take your past history and make the best choice for you.\n\nHave a nice day.\nBest wishes. :0)\n\nLibrarian\n\nThis answer is:"}

Because of what drugs there are out there that could possibly help you with these symptoms, I wonder what it\nwas that your friend/so was taking? You could possible see whether it was a medicine, an allergy drug, etc. that could cause that sort of\nreaction? If you can figure that part out, then you can possibly figure out a safe course of action to take when she is with you. As Alg asked,\nwe obviously can't ask her right now, but there is clearly a rational reason for why she may be doing this (if it's significant and not just one\ntime, may I suggest trying to get through to her if you can). I could only hope that nobody would deliberately make themselves or someone\nelse sick because the act itself seems unspeakably cruel. Keep in mind however, that due to seizures/being bed-ridden/etc. because of\ninability to handle stress/too much external sensual input, etc. a lot of people get \"post-traumatic stress\" or other such disorders that can\naffect mind/body chemical balances.

{"text": "Question: Like how much swelling is too much swelling? \n ### Answer: Does your ankle look like it just gained a pound or three? If so, there are a few cues to look out for that let you know it\u2019s time to see a doctor.\n\nIf you experience an instance of sudden swelling, be it an injury or from having a blood clot, these top signs will tell you if it is time to pay a visit to your local urgent care center or in the emergency room.\n\n## What You Need to Look For\n\nHere are a few things to keep an eye out for that let you know your swelling is out of the ordinary and need immediate care:\n\n### 1. Fever\n\nIf you have a fever along with the swelling, that could signal you may have an infection. The presence of a fever can indicate serious issues such as cellulitis, which is a skin infection, or a clot in your leg or arm, called DVTs. A fever that accompanies the swelling might not be present until a few days later. So, if you\u2019re feeling achy or are running a fever you should check with your closest urgent care doctor.\n\n### 2. Swelling Getting Worse By The Day\n\nShould you be at home and you\u2019re noticing that the swelling is progressively getting worse every day, it might be time to get it checked out. If your leg is unsightly and painful three days in a row, you should either seek urgent care or, if it is getting worse, go to the hospital. If you have an infectious disease such as cellulitis, don\u2019t wait, go right in, before the infection gets too bad.\n\n### 3. No Significant Injury To the Leg\n\nIt is rare to find trauma such as a tear in a calf muscle and severe swelling all at the same time. On the other hand, if you develop pain and swelling in your ankle or any other joint with no obvious injury, then you should be seeing a doctor right away. This can be a side effect of illnesses such as arthritis.\n\n### 4. Surrounding Pain and Bluish Skin\n\nTake note of any discoloration to the skin or any soft tissue that looks bruised. This could potentially be a DVT, that can spread through the body, and it could become life-threatening. Reduced blood flow can also"}
{"text": "Question: Sore throat can cause of pinkeye? \n ### Answer: If you experience the symptoms of pinkeye and a sore throat, you may come up with an idea that the condition is related to pinkeye. That\u2019s somewhat logical though. But what exactly evidence do we have about pinkeye that the bacteria or the virus when occurring together can immediately make an eyelid affected with pinkeye?\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s no clear evidence that can show that links of bacteria or virus causing your sore throat are actually responsible for the cause of the inflammation that occurs in your eye. If this inflammation happens in the inner membrane of your eyelid (that makes it painful and red), the right medical term for it is \u2018pinkeye\u2019!\n\nSore throat may happen for a variety of factors, and here are some of them:\n\n1. > The symptoms of pinkeye and sore throat are often worst between 12a.m-2p.m every day. They can make it difficult for swallow. Often, infected people may hoarseness or notice bad breath.\n2. > Having viral infection or common cold, fever, or the symptoms of an allergy (such as itching).\n3. > Having sore throat that relieved after taking antibiotics from doctor.\n4. > Swelling, either the tongue or lip and some other parts of your torso such as ears, chin, neck, tongue, cheek, and some else.\n5. > Having an infection from virus (viral infection that cause your sore throat.

{"text": "Question: What about antivirals? \n ### Answer: Antiviral medications are used to deactivate the HIV virus, making it inactive. Drug therapies cannot permanently get rid of the virus, but by using antivirals, patients will be healthy enough to live without worrying about serious consequences.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. This kind of therapy has significant negative side effects. They are known as \u201clife savers,\u201d but does the potential end justify the means? And who will cover the cost of these drugs? The cost of Synaprex can be a bit expensive for some people who are dependent on their expenses.\n\nDrug therapies may not be for everyone. They put so much stress on the body. Why not look into the more non-aggressive natural cure? Nutraceutical supplements are one natural alternative to drug therapies. Below is an explanation of how the various supplements combat HIV.\n\nRetrovir (AZT) medicines, for example, may prevent HIV cells from entering a healthy cell, or they may reign in viral production for a limited period of time. Research has shown specific nutrients can aid in the prevention of colds and other illnesses from developing full-blown virulent infection.\n\nProtease inhibitors are a good way to maintain the high levels of HIV that could otherwise destabilize your immune system\n\nThe immune system consists of dozens of individual cells and molecules that work together for the purpose of providing the body with protection against viruses, bacteria, and environmental and toxic substances.\n\nThe immune system must be engaged to stop the progression of the HIV virus invasion. The coronavirus kills all the blood cells that are found in your body. This condition does not have any treatment method that can be used to cure it. Hence no treatment can be used on it. Therefore, some drugs are also provided so that some pain is relieved to that patient. The virus is able to develop into the diagnostic detection of the HIV-infected person only when one cell from a different category of immune system cells are identified with that virus in metabolism.\n\nIt is rather difficult to identify the candidate as HIV-infected because a few dedicated immune systems in the body could not have been tagged with the HIV virus and the infection could be detected only after several years of exposure and unawareness of the disease.\n\nThe virus could not totally eliminate the human immune system to a human entirely, the reason is that there is a reserv"}

{"text": "Question: Should I titrate off of Effexor? \n ### Answer: What are some tips on tapering off medication?\n\n\u2014 Ellen\n\nEllen,\nEffexor, or venlafaxine, may be marketed by different generic names but it is in a class of medications used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and depression. Some people don\u2019t prefer to take medications and some people are fearful that when they try to decrease their dose there will be awful side effects. You asked if you should taper Effexor as well as some helpful tips for doing so. The answer to this question is different for everyone and an excellent idea is to always speak with your doctor about how to slowly decrease your dose unless you have recently been diagnosed with this particular situation. Many people will discuss how their medications have helped them or echo the pain and discomfort they experienced while trying to decrease their dose.\n\nEffexor will most likely cause withdrawal when you try to find the lowest dose you can take or when you try to discontinue the medication altogether. The withdrawal side effects are generally worse when you do the rapid dose decrease because when your body is suddenly deprived of a medication it has been accustomed to for period of time that your body can react. If you have been on a low dose, if withdrawal does occur from the rapid dose decrease it will more than likely be mild than if you had been on a higher dose beforehand. The half-life of the medication is generally three to five hours but this can be as long as 20 hours for someone who has taken the medication for four weeks or more.\n\nIt is very important for you to stay in constant communication with your physician about your withdrawal symptoms. It is very probable that if you discuss your options before you decide to try to decrease the dose of your medication or discontinue it altogether that you may find there is a good treatment plan for tapering off that is similar to the following scenario.

{"text": "Question: Is there anything I could take for the phlegm? \n ### Answer: Absolutely, please call to order and we may recommend several options for both nasal and chest phlegm.\n\nCan I just go in and get patches?\n\nNo, nicotine patches available over the counter do not contain any additives designed to assist in quitting or decreasing dependency. Therefore, they mostly don\u2019t work. If you request patches, we will do pre and post-screening assessments to determine which ones of these non prescriptive pharmaceuticals will be most successful at your level of dependence. Other pharmacy meds also require medical approval before dispensing. These include Champix and Zyban.\n\nDo you dispense prescription nicotine?\n\nYes, however there has been legislation limiting nicotine derived from tobacco to 2mg. We are hoping that this legislation will be abolished. That said for those with a high nicotine dependence and wanting to switch to vaping, we can supply nicotine containing salts up to 50mg. This is more useful than economics would suggest and the real reason that vaping is so much more effective than pharmaceutical therapies.\n\nFor referring customers, we provide a takes you through clear steps to assist in the process of education and understanding of the effects of nicotine mints and gums and their limitations.\n\nCan you fix my broken vape?\n\nWe offer comprehensive repairs at competitive prices.\n\nWhy do pharmaceutical nicotine replacement therapies make me gain weight?\n\nSmoking is a stress related activity, and with the boost of biochemical metabolites from nicotine there\u2019s a thinning of the veneer of appetite. The problem with nicotine mints and gums is that they increase \u201cstress\u201d but do not deliver nicotine, concentrating more on alleviating the oral nicotine activity. So a person that chews both nicotine replacements and good old sugar, may actually increase craving to relieve stress and increases intake pre or post meals.\n\nIs refrigeration necessary?\n\nNo, unless you wish to delay the use of your product \u2013 in which case an argument can be made that if you want to quit earlier refrigeration is going to help.\n\nStill not covered in \u2018Frequently Asked Questions\u2019 ?\n\nPlease contact us and we will sort it out for you."}
{"text": "Question: What about the increase in severity of cough and mucus production could that be bacterial needing antibiotic? \n ### Answer: There are many reasons for the escalation of cough and mucus production.\n\nConstantly running your nose and all its accompanying symptoms can lead to a relentless chain of sinus problems including the smell and taste of the food you eat as well as those congested feelings preventing a restful sleep. It is incredibly important to know the difference between infected sinuses and those that don\u2019t merit aggressive treatment such as that which an antibiotic would provide.\n\nThis is why it is important to know more about common sinus infections if you have them frequently.\n\nSinus Congestion\n\nIt is easy to remember 1: Choose naming the problem affected by the sinus by the impacted cavity in which the sinus infection is located. Using some treatment method to prevent the infection from happening or lowering the number of recurrent sinus infections you have is the best course for some. Knowing when to seek out medical diagnosis and treatment for your condition becomes very important to ease the discomfort and suffering too.\n\nSuccessfully treating sinuses requires the determining your particular problem accurately. However, this may be more difficult to accomplish as there are times when the same symptoms with different etiologies happen. For instance, when a feverish cold sets in, you might of course automatically think you have an infection. But in actuality, bacteria might not be the culprit because you tend to run a low-grade fever when you have a cold, one that hovers around 99 degrees Fahrenheit or a little higher, making it difficult to tell if the fever is cold related or an infection."}

{"text": "Question: Would antibiotics help? \n ### Answer: A patient with a surgical cut in the perineal region and sepsis is given ampicillin for 48 hours and then surround cephalosporin with only temporary improvement of the lesion. The pain continues and the place itself appears tragically, with a loss of appetite and a fall in the temperature. By clinical and endoscopic inspection of the urinary bladder, cystitis is diagnosed and the patient is treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for about a week.\n\nDespite treatment, the patient still has pain, loss of appetite and is not gaining weight, then through blood tests of impaired liver function, the doctor switches to cephalosporin in combination with \u03b2-lactamase (Dalvigra\u00ae) in an attempt to overcome antibiotic resistance.\n\nWhat is the cause of the redness and fatigue?\n\nThe patient has cirrhosis of the liver and poor blood flow, causing an overall immune deficiency.\n\nHow can it be clearly diagnosed?\n\nCirrhosis is often an asymptomatic disease in its earliest stages, which remains undetected. With the help of imaging examinations, no signs of impaired blood flow appear, as does no elevation in blood tests that indicate liver disorder. It is the diagnostics that is the most difficult in this case.\n\nThe symptoms described above could be signs of many things. Often, these are inflammatory processes that are treatable with antibiotics. However, proper diagnostics is much more than a series of symptomatic medications for an illness that may not exist, or may be caused by a weakening of the immune system. Symptoms can also indicate cirrhosis, liver and kidney, pancreas and biliary tract diseases, and many others diagnostics.\n\nIs herbal perhaps a way to health?\n\nOne of the safest alternatives in diagnostics can be found in mammalian medicinal plants, whose composition is reconstructed to restore the disrupted metabolic processes.\n\nTwo organisms are most affected by liver disease: adult dogs and cats with liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and young kittens or puppies where the pathological changes occur as a result of septic infection of a membranous intestinal inflam"}

{"text": "Question: what about chest congestion? \n ### Answer: Chest congestion occurs when phlegm builds up in your lungs, most commonly due to a cold, the flu or other upper respiratory infections. A cough is a natural response to chest congestion. The mucus may be yellow or yellow-green, and you may have a fever.\n\nThere are several ways to ease chest congestion and coughs. Drinking lots of fluid is the number one method. Rest is the most important part of recovery for any illness. Steam or hot showers may help as a treatment for congestion because the steam gets into the sinuses and acts as a decongestant. Honey has recently been shown to help ease coughs, so hot tea with honey has been suggested, though it is difficult to know how much you would drink to get the effective dose. Also, some research has shown that a night of sleep can help relieve various symptoms such as a cough, so catching some sleep with a nasal decongestant, or vapor rub on your chest or with a vaporizer can also be a help. Many medications may be tried too, and some contain natural ingredients or medicines."}

The important part here is that both eyes get drops at least when you do your drops use your right eye and the left one may or may not get as much if the right one was blocked it may get even more.

{"text": "Question: Is there any severe symptoms I should be on the lookout for if I do decide to wait? \n ### Answer: Generally PCOS is caused by higher than normal levels of male hormones. However some PCOS doesn\u2019t present with male hormones and so it should be tested for, since these do increase the risk of ovarian cancer, and other dangers. For many women who have PCOS, there is no severe symptoms caused by the excess male hormones {Androgen}\n\nPCOS is usually judged by: the absence of periods, the presence of cysts on the ovaries, skin type of hirsutism, etc As for more severe symptoms in waiting, let me explain a little PCOS for you and your doctor to better understand. In PCOS, women suffer too much androgen, which is a male hormone, meaning women who have too much of it end up with physical similarities to men! But on a lighter note, it\u2019s not that severe.\n\nHere are the First Steps to take if you think you have PCOS.\n\n1. Go to your doctor and have him tell you if you have PCOS and how bad it is (Or if you don\u2019t have it). Make sure you see your doctor or go to the regular gyno. Trust me, I had PCOS for years before I saw an endo and he said that he didn\u2019t even want to test me anymore because it was gotten too severe people don\u2019t catch it that early. PS because any obgyn should and can test for it even if they don\u2019t do this on a regular basis, I recommended asking for a test for this that is normally done in various tests instead of a regular hysteroscopic sonogram. Should make the results feel speedier.\n2. Test your symptoms, even the embarrassing ones like hirsutism; as they may be one of the many strange things that can turn your period away or help you out in treatment.\n3. If the symptoms make you want to let them be instead of treating them, let them be. From my own experience, I\u2019ve learned that the best way to treat PCOS is always held back by something. Especially if you\u2019re trying to lose weight for this; The endo who couldn\u2019t get me to do anything made me feel really bad so that\u2019s why I have a allergic reaction to the newest part II of Letting PCOS Be and one most women go see is a"}

{"text": "Question: Can I get something to treat the yeast infection too? \n ### Answer: Well, all depends on the severity of your system and on the degree of the yeast infection.

Another disadvantage here is that white vinegar burns even for the normal person as it\u2019s a powerful acid. As to boric acid only heat treatment rises the potability of this product to another level.

Well, same as already described, a cotton swab will be perfectly enough to tell the what type of infectious agent is thriving your system. This test is specially important along with the brownish discharge as it could indicate a wider range of infecting agent which includes fungal ones.

True 100s usually appear as solitary, painless, isolated nodules in the sinuses and are not related to an allergy (they\u2019re usually caused by Cryotherapy). The similar-looking fibroma would also be painless, but rather than in the sinuses, this type of 100 grows in the check tissue and the upper neck. An allergic reaction might also account for multiple 100s growing in the head and neck area. The inflammation they provoke (sometimes from simply getting sun exposure) might eventually shrink them back over time. The same can be said for the autoimmune process that provokes bird net lymphoma. Unless it\u2019s Certain 100s, the sooner it gets treated, the better.\n\nNina"}

{"text": "Question: The last question is can I continue with the Mucinex DM I have been taking once I begin the cough medication prescribed? \n ### Answer: If you need to take more than 112 mg of guaifenesin, a second dose can be taken 4-6 hours after the first dose. Other common brand names such as Mucinex and Robitussin DM usually come in packages labeled 300 mg, but most of them contain around four times as much guaifenesin as they do codeine, so you\u2019ll need to read the label carefully as to what is in each pill. The answer to this is that the usual recommended dose of guaifenesin in a cough product (the active ingredient found in Mucinex and Robitussin) should not interfere with their effectiveness. The combination works well and is entirely effective for treating cough.\nThus, before you can answer the question \u201ccan guaifenesin be taken with codeine?\u201d, you need to know the answer to the question \u201chow much guaifenesin should I take?\u201d. However, in the case of Robitussin AC, you should be sure to tell your doctor if you plan on taking a diabetic medication. Robitussin AC causes you to lose water ( dehydration). Many foods and medicines can interact with Codeine and Mucinex DM. If you get pregnant while taking this medicine, call your doctor or your pregnancy caregiver right away.\nIf you realize that the cough is associated with a cold, flu or the like, stop using Mucinex. If your cough is bothersome or doesn\u2019t go away, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine. For most people, taking only Mucinex DM won\u2019t decrease lung function. Teens: Your response to codeine may be different. If you\u2019re to prescribe codeine as a cough medicine, be sure to consider these factors, especially if the patient is aged 65 or older.\nIf you have a chronic cough and were told to stop taking any alreptra mucinex codeine medicine, there are other medicines that will work.

{"text": "Question: Is there anything I can take for the muscle aches ? \n ### Answer: Written by Anne Marie Flint\n\nIt is normal to experience some muscle aches and difficulty getting around during the first few weeks after your knee replacement surgery. This is because the muscles around a knee joint support the knee which is a load-bearing joint. During knee replacement surgery, these muscles and muscles of the back, abdomen and trunk are often disturbed and sometimes cut into to allow space to switch a new artificial knee joint/prosthesis into place. As a result of disturbing these muscles changes in sensation, nerve injury and trauma sometimes occur.\n\n## What can I do about the pain?\n\nEven people who have never experienced muscle aches before may be surprised and worried when their physiotherapist suggests exercises to strengthen their back and abdomen or trunk. It takes a great deal of effort and a lot of extra energy to change and shape big muscle groups. During the first 6 weeks after your knee replacement there are additional strains placed on your muscles- trying to get up and down from chairs, getting up from a bed, moving from one chair to another, walking to a shower, reaching and grasping.\n\nWhile exercising these trunk muscles can help reduce pain, often it can make it worse until the injury and trauma are healed. This means it is important to progress slowly with exercises and activity and to reduce levels of activity to avoid causing more muscle issues.\n\n## Additional conditions that can cause pain and discomfort:\n\n- Tight replacement components\n- Internal bleeding\n- Early hypermobility of knee components\n- Damage to lining of a joint\n- Direct injury to a knee including nerves\n- Surgical scarring\n\n## Some points to help you cope with these pains:\n\n- Have a stock of simple painkillers like paracetamol on hand\n- Make sure you follow the prescribed exercise programme carefully\n- Gradually involve the physiotherapist in helping you\nto reverse restrictions in the movement of your operated knee\n- We don't like admitting it, but sometimes very often people are limited by the amount of effort they are prepared to put into exercising.\n\n## Can something be done to treat the back and abdominal muscle aches?\n\nIf your back or muscle pain is severe, talk to your GP about trying a different pain relieving treatment such as anti-inflammatory drugs, stronger painkillers like codeine"}

I\u2019ll explain below.\n\n2) The bleeding could be anything from quite normal vaginal \u201cbloody show\u201d, something very unusual but natural like large clots of lochia before 40 weeks or could be preeclampsia (pregnancy high blood pressure) or a complete miscarriage.\n\n3) SEE A DOCTOR TO HAVE THE BLEEDING LOOKED AT.\n\nA few thoughts about \u201cstopping the bleeding\u201d-\n\nBleeding is the ultimate healing response in pregnancy.

What goes for the mother may be a bit different as the baby is a priority but I\u2019ll mention the mother below. You\u2019re just lucky that in most cases bleeding can be controlled medically but it\u2019s always better-go- early with \u201csomething is up\u201d on bleeding than late where thinking is \u201coh, this is settled and everything\u2019s fine\u201d.\n\nBleeding isn\u2019t always safe or necessarily welcome.\n\nEMS interest in stopping bleeding in winter (Cold-weather EMS), explained.

{"text": "Question: How soon after finishing the treatment can I have sex again? \n ### Answer: It depends on the type of treatment. For vaginal creams & tablets: it is advisable to wait for 5 or 7 days respectively after applying the final dose of therapy until you resume sexual activity. For single dose vaginal ring: it is better to wait for 24 hours after removing the ring before having sex. Although rare, you may have a sensitive reaction at the site of insertion after you remove it.\n\nHow soon will I start to feel more aroused and have more desire?\n\nThe results in clinical trials studies in HRTC are impressive. Shortly after starting testosterone treatment, all women perceived an improvement in their sexual desire and in associated sexual function. A transdermal gel which is more easily available and affordable offers tremendous scope of application and convenience of use. Thus, the time to feel \u2018more aroused and have more desire\u2019 is typically within weeks of starting treatment.\n\nI sleep with someone at night, can I apply the treatment afterwards?\n\nPlease ensure that the treatment is absorbed through the skin. It is important to wait until 2 hours after you\u2019ve bathed or showered, after which you can apply the testosterone gel. It\u2019s also important to ensure that the treatment isn\u2019t rubbed on the skin quickly.\n\nWill this treatment negatively affect my relationship with others?\n\nAfter you start your treatment, it\u2019ll be 6-8 weeks before you feel the full effects. This could have a positive effect on your relationship as you may start to becoming more aroused which can improve the relationship. Of course, this also allows you and your partner to be more experimental.\n\nWhy is testosterone being introduced for women \u2013 wasn\u2019t it previously a \u2018male\u2019 hormone?\n\nIn men and women, the male and female reproductive systems have evolved in different ways, but in essence they are made up of the same cells. Even the female reproductive system has testosterone in it. Testosterone is the principal sexual hormone in both sexes. Although we may consider it as a \u2018male\u2019 type hormone, it is fair to state that it plays a significant role in sexual health of both men and women. There is mounting evidence to prove the link between declining testosterone and aspects of non-reproductive sexual function in women \u2013 notably sexual desire and arousal disorder (SDAD)."}

Direct irritants can include something that is in direct contact with the eye, such as infections caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Indirect irritants of conjunctivitis are environmental allergens or chemicals.\n\nInflammations cause the tiny blood vessels on the white of the eye to become dilated, leading to swelling and puffiness. This inflammation creates a strong itching and burning sensation.\n\n## How Do You Reduce The Redness?\n\nThere are many ways to reduce the redness caused by conjunctivitis. Your ophthalmologist will perform maybe a visual testing which may involve using specialized dyes to highlight the cornea and eyelid exudates. Then,if you are diagnosed with a type of conjunctivitis, your doctor can make a recommendation on medication or home remedies.\n\nIn most cases of allergic conjunctivitis, a cool compress will often reduce the swelling in your eye.

It is also listed as a treatment for Cholera, Dipperosis, Giardia, enteric diseases and numerous other infections associated with disease of the intestines. It is interesting to note that this manual makes no reference to the use of pharmaceutical antibiotics for these bacterial or eukaryotic enteritis; they only mention research regarding colloidal silver. In other words, colloidal silver was the treatment of choice for many bacterial and parasitic intestinal diseases at one time, with no \"side effects\".\n\n1.

Heartburn after meals and laxative acid heartburn (after each meal - loose bowels) due to incomplete digestion.\n- Not only may these things all be caused by contact of gastric contents with the mucous membranes of the esophagus, but the risk of their persistence increases when they are characterized with a generic toxic condition.

Changes in the vaginal discharge, burning and itching around the private area, bleeding between periods or after sexual intercourse, pain during bowel movements, sores around the genitals or mouth, swelling, redness and tenderness around the vagina, bleeding after sex with lesbian partner are some of the common symptoms caused by the many forms of STDs.\n\nAnyone who suspects that he/she might have been exposed to an STD should go to an STD clinic promptly for a STD test even if he/she experiences just one or two symptoms. According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), a STD is a disease or infection that is transmitted from one person to another through sexual contact.\n\nMost forms of STDs have no symptoms but are passed from one partner to another during conventional sexual activity. Many people who have STDs tend to ignore the symptoms because they think their symptoms are a resultage of not having enough sleep and flu symptoms. The fact is that some STDs have no symptoms and one of the easiest ways to indicate whether an individual is going through STD issues is to keep an eye on your sexual partners for any signs and symptoms of a STD.\n\nThe worst or most painful thing to go through when you have an STD is when the person you are in a dating relationship with tends to have a STD but acts as if he/she doesn\u2019t have anything wrong with him/her.

{"text": "Question: Wait heat or ice? \n ### Answer: That is the question.  There is anecdotal evidence that each provides pain relief, so what is the truth?  Unfortunately, the truth is that I don\u2019t know for sure.  Anecdotally, icing a spine seems to work better than anything else.  Frances Hogan at CHG has Ricoh with multiple applications on it that he wraps around the spine, and it consistently relieves discomfort.  I haven\u2019t experienced real relief from heat, but I am told by my husband (a chronic heat idiometer) when it is working.  Of course, whether the pain is due to muscle spasm, nerve irritation, or disc herniation can make a difference in how effective ice and/or heat is.  For instance, theories support that if the pain is associated with muscle spasm, heat will provide relief; whereas, if the pain is associated with nerve issues, ice is a better choice.  That isn\u2019t always the case, however, as the body is quite neurobiologically complex.  For instance, the two heatwraps that work well for some people will not work at all for others.  The key seems to be trial and error."}

However, I think it's more psychological and anything can make you dizzy if you have to pinch your nose shut and hold your breath for 10 seconds (to insert the suppository into your rectum), like throwing up or being stuffed in a place like a trunk etc. Literally you just have to either ignore the suppository or eat the entire thing (not very pleasant, but its the suggestion given by some other truthful people), or do what I do and make yourself go to the bathroom (as opposed to pinching your nose), suppository goes in your mouth is all your arms can hold in and have a chair close by for support if you feel like you are going out."}

One common OTC medication is antacids, but they may not work for everyone. A new category of medications designed specifically for frequent heartburn and reflux is called PPIs, or Proton-Pump Inhibitors. This category includes medications such as Prilosec OTC, Prevacid 24HR, Nexium 24HR, and Protonix 24HR. Of these new heartburn medications, Prilosec OTC is available at most pharmacies, as well as discount and monthly warehouses.\n\nI am having heartburn and acid reflux but my doctor says I don\u2019t have to take drugs for it, since it clears up eventually. Aren\u2019t these just to kill the heartburn and acid reflux for a couple of days? Then what?\n\nThere is no need to take drugs if your heartburn and reflux respond to simple diet and lifestyle changes. Sometimes these are not enough and for those people, a drug to kill the acid is needed. Obviously it would be better to make changes that would prevent heartburn rather than take a drug that would kill symptoms. Drugs kill the heartburn and the acid reflux but often don\u2019t deal with the underlying reasons for heartburn (such as habitual snacking, large meal portions, or eating late).\n\nWhy don\u2019t the sidebar and footer match the design?\n\nThey are seperate files and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t have to match the design.

Miralax works best when taken as needed, she says, and should not be taken daily.\n\n## How many days can you take a stool softener consecutively?\n\nConclusion.

The middle ear is the part of the ear that is located between the eardrum and the inner ear. The middle ear is filled with air and it is connected to the throat by the Eustachian tube. The Eustachian tube is a small tube that connects the middle ear to the throat. The Eustachian tube helps to equalize the pressure in the middle ear.\n\nThe ear pain is usually caused by the inflammation of the middle ear. The inflammation of the middle ear is caused by the bacteria or the virus. The bacteria or the virus can enter the middle ear through the Eustachian tube. The bacteria or the virus can also enter the middle ear through the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin membrane that separates the middle ear from the outer ear. The eardrum can be damaged by the loud noise or the foreign object.\n\nThe ear pain is usually accompanied by the other symptoms such as the fever, the headache, the nausea, the vomiting, the loss of appetite, the loss of hearing, the dizziness, the balance problems, the ear discharge, the ear fullness, the ear pressure, the ear popping, the ear ringing, the ear itching, the ear swelling, the ear redness, the ear drainage, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear pain, the ear"}

{"text": "Question: So if it's not strep then what could it be? \n ### Answer: Diagnosis of pharyngitis depends greatly on when the symptoms occur.\n\n\u2022If symptoms develop within 1 week of returning from travel to countries in which Strep A type 5 is highly prevalent, the diagnosis of IM should be considered. Swabs should be taken from the tonsils and the pharynx, and these should be sent for Gram staining, elispot testing, and culture for both Strep A and Strep B. When the organism is present, the typical findings of Meta staff infection include organisms seen as strands of gram-negative diplobacillary rods in the Gram stain. Symptoms are similar to those for pharyngitis caused by streptococci.\n\n\u2022If symptoms develop within 1 week of using fruits or vegetables as raw food ingredients, the diagnosis of oropharyngeal candidiasis should be considered. Swabs should be taken from the tonsils and the pharynx and sent for culture. This is a disease of debilitated patients\u2014the elderly, the HIV-positive, the hospitalized, and those with alcoholism or a history of steroid use. It is detected by the appearance of randomly distributed white exudates on the oral mucosa. Treatment is by nystatin for 1 week or by fluconazole for 2 weeks. Patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome. Learn more in our editors' advisory about Call-Out: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.\n\n\u2022If tonsillar hypertrophy is detected, the diagnosis of tonsillitis should be considered. Examination of the palatine tonsils or any of the other paired lymphoid structures may allow visualization of their firm consistency and general elongation. It is highly vascular and would produce friability on touch, a likely site for bleeding. Other conditions that can give this clinical impression are epiglottitis, Kawasaki disease, and retained foreign bodies in the tonsil. Observing the patient swallow would be helpful in making the initial diagnosis. However, if there is risk for hemorrhage, no more than a complete head and neck history can be done. Any suspicion of these conditions in the pediatric patient requires immediate referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist or an ICU for intravenous corticosteroids and close observation."}

There\u2019s not a single pill to treat arthritis and you may have to try a few different ones before you find a combination that works. You are smart in asking your doctor what other OTC medication that may help and of course you will need to discuss with your doc any other meds you take already. Your doctor will very likely provide you with a list of arthritis meds and you can review them online to compare before you decide which script to pick.

The risk is if you find someone asymptomatic, where essential staff or senior managers or key workers are involved. Sinusitis is a pretty easily transmissible condition.\u201d\n\nSo am I understanding correctly that sinusitis can spread through airborne particles that come into contact with open skin or mucus membranes? Or contact with infectious secretions through direct touching or other contact with open skin or mucous membranes?\n\nI think sinusitis can be caused by bacteria or viruses, right? I heard it can be caused by viruses, but what about bacteria? Sinusitis can be caused by bacteria or viruses. It\u2019s most commonly caused by bacteria. Bacteria and viruses can cause it at the same time though. The viruses just make the symptoms worse.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that my mother said I might not make it through the night if I had COVID-19 sinus infection. What does she mean by saying that? My mother was talking about my mother.\n\nCould COVID-19 sinusitis be cured by viruses, bacteria, or both? I think it\u2019s a mixture of viruses and bacteria.\n\nI\u2019m still a bit confused about this, so maybe I\u2019m missing something. Can you explain a bit more about what you\u2019re saying? The main symptoms for me of viral infection were cold and flu. Symptoms that started to appear 2-3 days before I went into the hospital and stayed for the whole weekend. Sinus infection definitely is more of a bacterial or viral, and both can cause sinus injury.\n\nWhat are the main symptoms of COVID-19 sinus infection?

In many cases a flare up can seem to come out of nowhere.  More severe cases may require further treatment options from a doctor.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had any experience with psoriasis, what\u2019s it like?\nPsoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that manifests itself on the skin via symptoms like inflamed patches of itchy skin. Though psoriasis has no cure, a diagnosis can help you better understand your body and take action towards managing your condition.\n\nWhen a new case of psoriasis appears, it seemingly develops rapidly. The average time from detection to full development is just 3-5 days. Symptoms like itching, burning and tingling begin to appear just before the rash. Even when these symptoms present, they are usually not very obvious.\n\nIf needed, treatment of psoriasis can begin before the rash appears. Once signs become apparent, topical medicine, prescription ointments and UV light treatments can all be used to treat and manage a case of psoriasis."}

{"text": "Question: How often can I used the netty pot? \n ### Answer: Netty is usable, reusable, and highly effective, up to 600 times per usage.\n\nWill a netty pot take care of all my breathing or sinus issues?\nMost every one has suffered congestion and sniffles from time to time. Nothing works better than a Netipot to rinse out a stuffy nose or sinus passages.\n\nYou have heard it before, a stuffy nose starts with a foreign object, usually a mucous clog, at the back of the nose, but that triggers allergy and asthma symptoms. Mucous is a natural defense which your body produces to flush out antigens. Allergens, bacteria, dust mites, mold, and viruses have a way of getting into your nose. Dust and pollen are the most commonly encountered allergens this time of year. There is really no way to completely get rid of them, but you can teach your body to cope more effectively with them. More important, having your sinuses clear-cut can lessen the chances of a sinus infection. Our sinus passages are lined with mucous membranes that help trap dust and other foreign antigens, and then gently flush them out the nose.\n\nWhat are the benefits of stronger sinus passages?\nSaline Solution (children need only a low salt solution not sterile) can be used a couple of times a day to keep your nasal passages moistened and open. It effectively clears the sinuses by innocent washing out the trapped bacteria, allergens, or other causative agents, like pollen, without tearing up the nose lining like the piles of tissue you go through. Nasal congestions occur due to narrowing of smaller nasal passages. As a result fresh air supply through the nose reduces, and the result is ''see through'' smell and sleep apnea. Deliberate nasal washing keeps the smell acuity razor sharp. It also helps the brain to be active..\n\nThe solution is simple and home-made or commercially available, in packets, nasal drops or sprays. Just mix a teaspoon of table salt or NaCl into a glass of warm water while using sterile water if having rashes on the nose.\n\nAs a teacher, I would recommend the Netipot as an important part of a child\u2019s medicine chest, along with a"}

It can cause problems with your periods and make it difficult to get pregnant. PCOS also may cause unwanted changes in the way you look. For example, women with PCOS may have excess hair growth on the face, chest, back or thumb. PCOS also may lead to long-term health problems, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\nPCOS is a common endocrine system disorder among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (functional cysts) and fail to regularly release eggs.\n\nThe exact cause of PCOS is unknown.

{"text": "Question: One last question about lexapro, can you drink any amount of alcohol while taking it? \n ### Answer: I am just curious what it would do to me.\n\n1 Answers\n\nGenerally, when taking antidepressant medications you should ask your doctor if you can drink alcohol while taking it. Although alcohol doesn\u2019t affect serotonin levels, it can affect your benefit achieved from the antidepressants.\n\nDrinking before bedtime can cause some disorientation. This results in effects similar to those taken by an MAOI antidepressant.\n\nIn some cases, alcohol takes antidepressants. It can cause some inhibition of the absorption of serotonin in the brain, leading to an increase in the symptoms of the serotonin syndrome, which is the symptom usually caused by an MAOI antidepressant.\n\nNote that SSRIs like Lexapro are not entirely like MAOIs, they have some important differences especially regarding the dangers of mixing alcohol with the two.\n\nHowever, if you have tried and experienced some problems in mixing too much alcohol with Lexapro or does it lead to unwanted side effects, then it\u2019s best if you talk to your doctor first before drinking alcohol again.\n\nYour Answer"}

{"text": "Question: How long am I considered contagious? \n ### Answer: Can my friends catch the virus from me? The effects of the virus are sleeper, but this does not mean that friends and family are not at risk. Anyone that comes into contact with an infected person, no matter how long the virus lives in the body, runs the risk of catching the virus. Here are guidelines for informing friends and family that you have been diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nMost healthcare professionals advise the coronavirus is not potentially contagious after two weeks of exposure to PEI. People are out for seven to fourteen days if they are exposed to those who have contracted the disease. After a period of one week, symptoms are usually not intolerable and most infections will go away on their own. In the case of people also caught by PEI, decontamination measures are senseless as long as symptoms are not evident. But this is not an assurance that nothing has been infected.\n\nSome healthcare professionals say that the possibility of infection is no longer exsisting after two weeks of exposure to the group-IA virus. This ignores the fact that the virus is likely to resurface in new fashions, such as hidden viruses and symptoms in varying capacities. Looking forward, consider that infection information is always changing and possibly should be regularized.\n\nOnce infected by the group-IA virus, you will be tested for the coronavirus every two weeks to ensure your body is neutralized and your symptoms are not active. As symptoms surface, you will be isolated at the hospital for anywhere between a day to two weeks to ensure that the infection has been banned. If a quarantine sentence is not issued, you will be placing yourself at risk by continuing to live your life without being protected by the group-IA virus.\n\nIn cases of infection, preventing new infection is of utmost importance. If your two weeks of exposure have been recognized, isolating yourself from infected persons is necessary. While this may seem impossible \u2013 especially with the increase of people becoming symptomatic from the coronavirus \u2013taking precautions to minimize exposure to those who are carriers of the coronavirus is recommendatory."}

It takes about 10 minutes to calm the nerves and help you recognise when they are \u2018on alert\u2019.\n\nEating the \u2018right\u2019 diet\n\nThis may sound like it is really hard to do, but please do not panic, this is easier than you think. There are lots of ways to help the body manage the pain so the nerves are less likely to get upset and irritated.\n\n1) Eat at least 1/2 banana a day. Yes, that\u2019s right, just a few slices a day. The body needs potassium to maintain nerves health, because, nerves run on chemicals and potassium is the bodies store house and regulator.\n\n2) Garlic. Garlic is the spice of life. True, but, it also has properties that will help rid the body of nasty toxins. Finding the right balance of foods in your diet is important \u2013 if you need an aimed suggestion then please feel free to send me an email. Let\u2019s discuss.\n\n3) Water. Water is such a simple, natural, non inexpensive method to help the body maintain healthy, you just need to drink 2 litres (4-6 pints) per day and you will increase the chance of your body flushing out toxin and organise the bods rubbish file in a timely fashion. \ud83d\ude42 That\u2019s about half a normal water bottle (20-30 fl oz) every 2 hours.\n\n4) Whole grain carb. These can be tricky, it is better to start eating some carbohydrates at the beginning of the day and allow your body to use the natural sugars to get upping and goings. These sugars allow the body to adjust (dilate) so it can get on with the important bits and leave the body"}

How many strains are in the probiotic formula?\n\nIt\u2019s best to have more than one strain present in your probiotic. Different strains (species) of bacteria have different functions. Healthy bacteria in the gut are thought to play many functions ranging from bile detoxification to immune protection to interacting with gut muscle to help food digest to making Vitamins B and K to supporting metabolism of certain toxic substances such as alcohol.\n\nIt\u2019s best to aim for a probiotic that has more than one species present and ideally more that one strain of each different species.\n\nOur top probiotic for young children and for delicate digestion contains a two strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus when used as part of our 5 step food based nutrition program\n\n2. Does the probiotic strain have a Latin name?\n\nA bacteria species that has a Latin name described in the medical literature is more likely to work. When a registered nutritional consultant develops a formula they may only mention the genus and the species of bacteria. For example, the label may state that it contains \u201cLactobacillus rhamnosus\u201d.\n\nThis information may be enough to tell us which genus (Lactobacillus) but not which species (rhamnosus).For example we would not know if the \u201cLactobacillus rhamnosus\u201d meant \u201cLactobacillus Rhamnosus GG or Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Lc705. Your naturopath or GP can help you identify which species of bacteria they have recommended.\n\n3. Does it have a probiotic bacterium that is cold-stress resistant?\n\nMany products are handled at room temperature from the time of the manufacturing process. During summer sunshine temperatures, these bacteria will be less stress resistant than if they are manufactured at a low temperature. It may degrade if you have a foreign holiday. At this"}

{"text": "Question: Cancer score or canker score ? \n ### Answer: Cancer is a disease that is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. These cells can invade and destroy the surrounding healthy tissue, and can spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and it is estimated that one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime.\n\nThere are many different types of cancer, and each type is characterized by the type of cell that is affected. For example, breast cancer affects the cells in the breast, while lung cancer affects the cells in the lungs. Cancer can also be classified based on the stage of the disease, which refers to how far the cancer has spread.\n\nThe causes of cancer are not fully understood, but it is believed that a combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role. Some risk factors for cancer include smoking, exposure to certain chemicals and radiation, and certain lifestyle choices, such as a poor diet and lack of exercise.\n\nTreatment for cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease, and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. In some cases, a combination of these treatments may be used.\n\nDespite the challenges of cancer, there have been significant advances in cancer research and treatment in recent years. These advances have led to improved survival rates and a better quality of life for many cancer patients.\n\nIn conclusion, cancer is a complex and serious disease that can have a significant impact on a person\u2019s health and well-being.

{"text": "Question: Should I get a PCR test? \n ### Answer: If you think you recently had COVID-19, have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, or have been asked by your healthcare provider, test processing lab or local government  to get tested, experts recommend getting a PCR test.

{"text": "Question: Can I buy antibiotics off the internet? \n ### Answer: yes you can, antibiotics is off the internet and on the market like E medicine, and precription also.\n\nantibiotics are to use in diseases caused by bacteria. e.g typhoid, ulcers, meningitis, diarraphea, etc\n\nAn antibiotic is a medication used to treat bacterial infections. Fungal, viral, and some parasitic infections are best treated with other types of medications. In some cases, as with herpes simplex, particular nutrients enhance healing. As with any medication, check the safety of antibiotics with your health professional before using them.\n\nWhat Types of Things Promote An Antibiotic Response?\n\nYour body has an immune system for good reason. It protects you against both internal and external threats to your health, including infections. Although antibiotics are useful in fighting infections, they are most effective when your immune system is doing its job as well. When you contract an infection, it is usually your immune system that is the first to respond to the invader.\n\nIf a concern about antibiotic use is an issue, make sure to ask how to protect the immune system with whole foods and nutrients. There are often simple ways to use these healing agents that can help reduce your dependence on antibiotics.\n\nWhen antibiotics are used, these medicines are sometimes combined with other medications to compensate for the antibiotics natural effects. For instance, a medication such as Benadryl is sometimes recommended for rash that may develop as soon as within 24 hours from taking the first does of antibiotic. The rash may be a sign that the antibiotic is working. The rash may resemble meningococcal disease symptoms, which is a serious illness, but is unrelated to a meningococcal vaccine reaction.\n\n## Recommendations for Minimizing Functional Impairment\n\n- Take prescribed antibiotics. For those who become ill from chlamydia, taking prescribed antibiotics every day for a specified period is very important in keeping the chlamydia gone.\n- Learn early warning signs of other conditions.

{"text": "Question: One question do I need an oral antibiotic? \n ### Answer: These days, the answer is frequently no.\n\nFrom experience here at RV Smile Dental, we find that many patients who need antibiotics would actually benefit more from what we refer to as prehabilitation.  This involves the use of prescription regimens that set the stage for getting the most benefit from dental implants, dental implant surgery, or any other dental procedure. This article discusses the range of types of pre-operative oral antibiotic regimens and how they relate to each other. In the context of dental implant surgery, the specific goal of these regimens is a significant reduction of the bacteria that can become lodged adjacent to implants in the bone with a high potential for infection. While the peri-implantitis pathogen generates suboptimal amounts of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide (and therefore non-harmful) oral pathogens can generate much greater amounts than this in large burden causing significant inflammation and swelling of both the mucosa and bone. An oral-antibiotic, loaded intra-bone during dental-implant-surgery is also advisable, to account for oral pathogen isolation during surgery. At RV Smiledental in Adelaide we ask you to use an oral-antibiotic armodafinil.org for a few weeks leading up to any major dental implant surgery.\n\nIn this article you will learn about:\n\n## Seven types of pre-op oral antibiotic regimens:\n\n1= Fully effective: Regimens of dual systemic antibiotics that are an oral, amoxicillin.\n\n2= Fully effective: Regimens of dual systemic antibiotics that are an oral, amoxicillin and clindamycin.\n\n3= Fully effective: Regimens of mono systemic antibiotics that is an oral, amoxicillin.\n\n4= Dual oral antibiotics that are: oral amoxicillin and finasteride.\n\n5= Fully effective: healthy heart people who have a mono systemic antibiotics that is a single intra-arterial antibiotic: The penicillin G is given once intravenously.\n\n6= Useless: Oral co-amoxiclav.\n\n7= Risky"}

{"text": "Question: What are some over the counter medication I could take instead? \n ### Answer: Medications known to be helpful shorten the length of time you feel unwell. Some are available over the counter.\n\nIf you have difficulty breathing, a combination of fever and rhinorrhea or sore throat, or body aches, I recommend some acetaminophen (Tylenol) and some ibuprofen (Advil). Alternatively, codeine is an effective fever-reducer and pain reliever available over the counter.\n\nLortab, however, is not recommended because has an opium derivative in it known as Norcot. For some patients this is a balm that helps, for others, it can make the symptoms worse. Furthermore, lortab is not very pleasant if you have ever dealt with nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe best advice is to visit with your primary provider before taking something without knowing if it is a good choice for you.\n\n## How do I know if something is contagious?\n\nIt is most upsetting to feel well on Monday and be laid low by the week of flu symptoms for the rest of the week. Many clues lead to the answer that something is contagious:\n\n- Sore throat\n- Raging fever\n- Nausea or aching muscles\n- Headache\n- Cough\n\nIf two or more of the above manifest themselves, this is an indicator of a virus or bacteria cause.\n\nIt is a good idea to check with your Primary Care Physician before taking any over the counter medications without first discussing your symptoms.

Each infection cleared  up in two weeks with appropriate treatment. One of the women had been undergoing dilatation to maintain the patency of her bladder outlet. It is possible that these infections were a coincidence and are worth paying attention to in terms of women over fifty. http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/menopause-yeast-infections-and-uti\n\nThe more challenging question is what constitutes a menstrual period. One is born with menstruation. It occurs whether you like it or not. Some people continue to have bleeding into their 30s or even younger. (Some women aren\u2019t even 15 when their first menstrual period occurs). Not all bleeding is part of the normal menstrual cycle. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, endometritic infection, multiple vaginal bleedings also commonly occur, as do hemorrhagic cysts and uterine polyps in which masses bleed at any time. Even misplaced intrauterine devices (IUD) can cause bleeding. Treatments that alter the natural state of the body, such as hormone therapy and Danazol, have side effects that can lead to bleeding. Sometimes this is a nuisance, sometimes a trivial matter. Nevertheless the bleeding should be assessed. Untreated myomas, polyps, bleeding of cervical erosion, sexually transmitted diseases, or infections can lead to cancer, though early treatment is very unlikely to eradicate cancer.\n\nMy younger and older panthers know how every menstruation is unique in terms of blood flow, symptoms, including vomiting, diahrea, headaches, mood swings, hot flashes, other rashes and swellings to light cramps, and discharge. Some of those have a placebo effect and medicine has attempted to adopt placebo treatments such as birth control pills to treat excretions that make one feel \u201cbeleaguered\u201d.\n\nCandidiasis and other infections, such as"}

{"text": "Question: Since I havent had a fever in almost 48 hours, am I still considered contagious? \n ### Answer: I am scheduled to go to the imaging center for a bone density test and some chest x-rays this afternoon, but am worried, if I am contagious, what if I give the tech covid. I will be wearing a mask by I dont really kow what i should be doing when i get there...do i just stand 6 feet away from the tech?\n\nThe 14 days for the 2 incubation periods doesn't hold true for those of us who waited 10 days to test. This person is still contagious but how long depends on what medication he is taking. If he has ivermectin, 5 days would mean he is uncontagious considering there was a negative result after only 5 days of antibiotic therapy. If on steroids or nothing, it may take 10 or more days.\n\nYou wear a mask so if you get asymptomatic till you get there, you're protecting them from any potential transmission. That's why they want you to come back and get the swab if you develop symptoms.\n\nIn related news, suppressing private testing has resulted in a reporting loophole which enables employers to ignore and is allowing people to ask friends/relative (Immediate or otherwise, because in general I'm finally seeing \"friends\" yesterday, to get a test if they are planning to gather inside) to get others tested and not report it, so the numbers are off and will probably not align with deaths any more... per a WSJ article today.\n\nOf the noted exceptions to masking, treating covid patients with no mask is at the top of the list. They didn't tease out why, but they may no longer be surface spreaderosus.\n\n## 192 Replies\n\n@BigZelda -- \"Im not coughing, today, and havent in days....\"  And even a higher proportion don't ever develop that symptom in the first place.\n\n@macingb Thank  you for responding.\n\n@seemsLegit I dont think I mentioned coughing.

{"text": "Question: Do you know what causes UTIs? \n ### Answer: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem for women. In fact, 50% of women will have at least one UTI in their lifetime.\n\nUTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply in the bladder. The most common type of bacteria that causes UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli).\n\nOther types of bacteria that can cause UTIs include Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.\n\nUTIs can be treated with antibiotics, but they can also be prevented by taking steps to keep the urinary tract healthy.\n\n## What causes UTIs?\n\nThere are a few things that can cause UTIs. One is when bacteria from the bowel gets into the urinary tract. This can happen if you have a bowel movement and then don\u2019t wipe properly.\n\nAnother way bacteria can get into the urinary tract is through sexual activity. If you have sex and then don\u2019t urinate afterwards, bacteria can get into the urinary tract.\n\nFinally, UTIs can also be caused by certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or kidney stones.\n\n## How to prevent UTIs\n\nThere are a few things you can do to help prevent UTIs. First, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, especially water. This will help flush out any bacteria that may be in your urinary tract.\n\nSecond, try to urinate as soon as you feel the need to go. Holding in your urine can allow bacteria to grow and cause an infection.\n\nFinally, if you have a history of UTIs, talk to your doctor about taking a low dose of antibiotics on a regular basis. This can help prevent infections from occurring.\n\n## What are the symptoms of a UTI?\n\nThe most common symptom of a UTI is pain or burning when you urinate. You may also feel the need to urinate more often than usual, and your urine may be cloudy or have a strong odor.\n\nIf you have a fever, chills, or pain in your lower back, you may have a more serious infection.\n\n## How are U"}

They typically resolve in a number of weeks. However,, an augmenting antidepressant may have a different mechanism of action than your initial medication and have a totally different harm profile\n\nYour side effects of height may be from your initial antidepressant dose (assuming my you\u2019ve already been monitored and gotten slowly energized to your goal dose).\n\nFor wellbutrin, bupropion, there might be a dramatic s56k renewal in side effects to increase up to an extra maximum dose of 400mg/day. Some side effects resolve over time once there\u2019s a toleration to the drug. A new maximum dosage of 450mg/day is really well tolerated by about 30% of people.\n\nConventionally in enhancing a toxicity side effects of Wellbutrin could possibly occur, you should talk to your doctor to see if you should either decrease the dose of survival, change meds or add another medicine to your current antidepressant medicine.\n\nOR his might end up being a local climb in w587 energy levels from the bupropion itself or even from an energy boost of the enhance. or this might be part of your depression improving in other words more energy and emotions of hope, etc. Before using the augmenting drug reassess your patient for a manic symptoms.\n\nYour therapist should also discuss if you should be thinking about an augmenting medication for your depression. There wouldn\u2019t be many reasons to make an addition like an augment if symptoms improved. But if your wellbutrin wasn\u2019t working, you could consider despair psychotherapy. The augmentation combination\u2019s work at hypnotherapy at a particular time, but it could cause more side v34d effects.\n\nFrom what you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re really doing well and sure the bupropion dosage increase was worth it. Hope you start bupropion next week."}

{"text": "Question: How long will it take for symptoms to reside? \n ### Answer: Pain: It usually begins to enhance as symptoms start to disappear. However it is also feasible that pain might go away before the other signs.\n\nGenerally, the disease ( signs and symptoms) lasts 2 to 4 weeks, but can occasionally last up to 6 weeks.\n\nOften sighns begin to disappear after 3 days, which might feel as if the symptoms are regressing slowly. Judy T. Purdue, an infectious disease specialist at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nShe clarifies that fatigue signs (such as aching muscles) are sometimes embedded and linger a little longer, returning similarly slowing.\n\nOften symptoms cleave off in stages (one to 3 days), instead of separately. For instance, a person could suffer from short-lived fevers the very first or second day, cough and sore throat for a number of more days, then ongoing fever and fatigue around the 4th day, if each of these signs are not gone."}

{"text": "Question: Yes it does, is it safe to use diluted hydrogen peroxide in the nasal rinse? \n ### Answer: - Not exactly. The National Jewish Medical and Research Center states that hydrogen peroxide is not recommended for use within the nasal passages as a sinus rinse. An ethnic rhinosinusitis specialist, Jeffrey A. Cady, M.D., is also quoted as discouraging the use of hydrogen peroxide within the nose, for various reasons, including concerns over what chemical reactions might occur within the surrounding tissue and how it might affect cells. It is best to use a saline solution, as many allergists use personal jet irrigators for their patients, to keep the sinuses clean and clear of irritants. Though (organic) vinegar solutions have been used for people with a normal airway, the issue of safety is still a concern, as no formal testing has been conducted on this issue. Sodium without sufficient water content can cause a chemical burn. While some research has been concluded on using hydrogen peroxide to treat infections caused by pathogens such as superbugs, its safety within the nasal cavity is still a concern.\n- Hydrogen peroxide is not recommended for use within the nasal passages because it can create inflammation to the tissue. While research is promising (AB, 2014) regarding decreased patient viral cell count and improvement of symptoms associated with sinus infection, such as cough, runny nose, and fatigue, there has been significant study on the corrosive properties of hydrogen peroxide (J Neurosurg Sci 2000;44:313-9, and others). Many physicians recommend a saline solution to use within the nose to clean. However, should you wish to use a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water in your rinse, first thoroughly dilute the solution with water (8 oz. at the very least). Always perform a nasal rinse test on the cuff of your arm first. A slight burn is to be expected and usually clears up within a few minutes. Severe pain, discoloration, or bubble formation are indications for a visit to your doctor or emergency room.\n- Dilute H202 is safe - but ONLY when mixed with saline. Perform a nasal irrigation with saline alone periodically. Mixing a 3% dilution of H202 with an equal part of saline"}
{"text": "Question: What does this medication do? \n ### Answer: What do the side effects look like and how severe are they?\nDo I need a prescription?\nWhat is the price?\n\n## What does Anavar do for your body?\n\nAnavar is taken by bodybuilders in order to increase strength and muscle mass. The results are best achieved when stacked with other steroids. Since it is relatively safe to use and mild, bodybuilders expect to improve strength and size for short amounts of time up to three weeks while reducing body fat.\n\nAnavar users can really push hard in the gym and do more when compared to others. They often see a marked decrease in weight when using the drug since it makes it easier to shed fat in the process. Without the added the muscle mass and other more severe side effects of other steroids Anavar users may stop the drug when it is found to be working. Generally, those taking Anavar store less body fat, create better results in losing bodyweight and build strength without losing muscle mass.\n\nAnother benefit of Anavar is its great kickstart to a cutting cycle. Some bodybuilders stack it with Masteron in the last few weeks of a cycle to get solid results in seeing cuts. Users also pair Anavar with other steroid compounds that may prove to be harsh on the user. This helps them to reduce down-time between cycles as they recover and their health improves.\n\nShow me the good and bad side effects of Anavar\n\n## Anavar Side Effects\n\nThere are good side effects of taking Anavar but also those that are bad. It will drastically increase your appetite when in use. This alone has minor side effects like acne, gas, diarrhea or even hair loss for some users. Others may experience boils, lipid tolerance changes, nausea, vomiting, itching, skin rashes, fever and yellowing of the skin or eyes.\n\nMost bad side effects come from those who are predisposed to such problems. This is why it is best not to stack Anvar with such drugs since the risk is greater to the user. For those that had history of kidney and liver issues in the past they should avoid Anavar. Its also best to use with other steroids that are better than Anvar or less harsh than other drugs as it will compound these issues with further problems.\n\nThe last thing to avoid using Anvar is"}

A major reason is that conventional antibiotics under development today have all failed within the last 40 years.\n\nMeanwhile, patients in need of antibiotics often wait too long to get the correct medication, because physicians must make educated guesses about the most common bacteria involved and which antibiotics the bacteria may or may not be resistant against.\n\nSome recent breakthroughs suggest that treatments might soon be available that kill bacteria by non-traditional measures. Here are few examples of new antibiotic technologies in development and in the market:\n\n1. Silent RNAs Nanoparticles\nSilent RNA Nanoparticles can silence the genes that bacteria use to resist antibiotics. Scientists from Harvard Medical School have developed a synthetic nanoparticle that shields the body from harmful toxins. The nanoparticles have been shown to successfully treat four bacterial infections in animal models and has been said to be effective, even against bacteria that are highly resistant to vancomycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic.\n2. Gold nanoparticles\nGold nanoparticles can penetrate and disassemble self-formed biofilms, and this feature means that they can reach and damage every cell within a biofilm, unlike traditional antibiotics that can only harm exposed bacteria.\n3.

{"text": "Question: Is there an alternative for strep medication that will not affect my birth control? \n ### Answer: If a strep throat test is positive, the recommended treatment is penicillin, but you should not take this antibiotic if you are taking \u201cmini-pill\u201d forms of progestin-only birth control contraceptives.  However, there are alternatives of strep therapy and you should consult your healthcare provider.\n\nThe \u2018mini-pill\u2019 is one variant of progestin-only contraception, dispensed in the US as NOR-Q D (Novum).  With the normal pill, women must remember to take one every day of a monthly regimen in order to stay protected from unwanted pregnancy, but a dose of the \u2018mini pill\u2019 lasts a full three days.\n\nObserved side effects of the \u2018mini-pill\u2019 is inconsistent with other forms of birth control, but it should not affect most women.\n\nWomen taking the progestin-only pill have reported bloating and breast pain\u2014usually reported within six months of use.  The pill\u2019s progestin content declines as each hormone-rich capsule is consumed, which also decreases the amount of progestin available to inhibit ovulation.\n\nHormone levels normally return to typical female levels prior to the next capsule you have to ingest.  Therefore, the best advice is to use a form of contraception other than the \u201cmini-pill\u201d whenever you are also taking antibiotics."}

{"text": "Question: Would symptoms of an sti disappear and then come back? \n ### Answer: If you were diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease and treated for it lately, you may be wondering if having symptoms again means the disease has come back or that you have picked up a new infection.\n\n### What are sexually transmitted infections?\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STI), also known as sexually transmitted diseases (STD), are infections you can get by having sex or sexual contact with others. STIs are caused by germs called bacteria and viruses found in semen, vaginal discharges, and blood.\n\n### You had symptoms of an STI before treatment:\n\nSymptoms are uncomfortable sensations you notice that tell you something is not right in your body. If you have an STI, you may notice symptoms that will alert you to the fact that you need to be checked. If you now have the same symptoms again, you should see your health care provider again so the infection doesn\u2019t recur. The cause could be a persistent or early phase of the same infection you had before. Or, it could be a new infection from another source.\n\nYou don\u2019t usually get more symptoms upon treatment, or experience a \u201chealing crisis\u201d in this way for infections. Your body may respond with slight to moderate discomfort or flu-like symptoms for a few days while the medicine is causing it to heal. If you have this type of reaction though, it normally only lasts a few days.\n\n### You did not have symptoms before treatment:\n\nYou may have contracted an STI, but it may have been at a time when the infection was in the early phase of development and thus was not yet symptomatic. It is also possible that you were infected and the body passed the infection quickly from you leaving no after effects. However, some other person you had close contact with may have had symptoms that lasted a week or two prior to you spending time with him or her.\n\nWhen it comes to STI, the body\u2019s immunity is a complicated mechanism and you may experience no symptoms, as well as very mild symptoms that you dismiss as something else.\n\nIf you have questions about this, visit your health care provider or a health care provider in your community. You can find a health center at http://getchecked.ca to test for STIs and to receive free STI clinic services.\n\n### There are only a few STIs that will cause a cure"}

It actually made it a little worse. Does this always happen or did I just do it wrong?\n\nDo I put the topicort on the red part as well as the other areas to keep infection from starting.\n\nThanks for the advice!\n\n### 1 answers\n\nAlways, always tell your doctor what medicines you are using presently.\n\nTopicort is a steroid, which will thin the skin and promote the spread of infection if there is contact with a virus or bacteria which can live in the thin layer of skin. This is why you don't use this for more than a week until you get it under control, moisturize so that there is less contact with the bacteria and use it sparingly. Try to help control the symptoms so you don't get another rash. Eliminate dyes, birth control, hot showers, shaving, lotions, salty foods or medications which may be causing rashes. When uncovered with not treated you can take longer to heal or the new rash will react differently, which causes the constant cycle.\n\nSince you are in a rash cycle you need to see the doctor to get treatment first so they can rule out or treat for diseases. There are many things which can cause hive like plaques without food allergies.\n\nHope this helps, let me know if I can help with anything else."}

{"text": "Question: Its normal to be sore and raw from the back of the nose to down in the throat? \n ### Answer: That\u2019s the pharynx for you, and often it swells up when you're coming down with an infection. Overnight it becomes a vessel for a giant tanker truck of runny mucus, taking it from your sinus cavities to its entryway at the back of the throat. That, my friend, is swollen throat with congestion, one of the symptoms of a sinus infection, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nAnd it could be a sore throat, due to the general swelling of the pharynx. But it's technically a bit different, WebMD reveals. \"Inflammation of the spot at the back of the throat, known as the pharynx, is caused by trauma or illness,\" WebMD reports, \"and can lead to a scratchy, raw sensation. Swell glands around the throat can contribute to this discomfort.\" That's likely why your throat feels like it's closing up.\n\n## Triggers and causes of a sore or swollen throat\n\nSo what causes this throbbing pain, anyway? Well, like with every other kind of muscle, trauma does it. But instead of sharp trauma, the associated factors are chronic ones. A sinus infection, an infection in the pharynx, postnasal drip, dry air, and acid reflux all mess with your throat, according to Mayo Clinic, so look them up if you can.\n\nYou'll probably want to check it out just in case it has something to do with the trauma or swelling of your glands. A swollen gland can cause a sore throat along with swell tonsils, swollen glands in the back of the jaw, swelling in the back of the mouth, even swollen adenoids (respiratory tissue) or the tissue underneath your tongue that's called the lingual tonsils. The normal way to know if you've got swollen glands is if you feel them with your tongue, Tracy Hilsman-Lai, MD, an otolaryngologist at UT Medicine in Austin, Texas, tells EveryDay Health.\n\nSo if that's all familiar, maybe just eat some cool soup. But don't forget to keep your ears open for fever, chills, pus on the tonsils, or trouble breathing or swallowing. That's when this gets a little serious."}

Below are a few basic differences that can help you out.\n\nPink Eye or Conjunctivitis? What Is the Difference?\n\nSince a pink eye, even when common, is often misunderstood. Now let's deep dive into pink eye vs conjunctivitis through the differences between the curable conjunctivitis and its relapse counterpart, pink eye. It all depends on differentiating between the two to carry out effective treatment and prevent relapse.\n\nPink Eye Definition: What Is Pink Eye?\n\nPink eye, also named acute conjunctivitis, is an inflammation of the lining that covers the eye (conjunctiva). Conjunctival blood vessels become inflamed in response to a variety of triggers and expand, making the eye's inner tissue pink or red.\n\nWhat is Conjunctivitis?\n\nConjunctivitis is typically caused by infectious agents or an intimate environmental cause. Viruses and bacteria can cause infectious conjunctivitis in both young and adult conjunctivitis. It is also known as Conjunctivitis.\n\nPink Eye Or Conjunctivitis? What Is the Difference?\n\nEyelid swelling, irritation, a burning sensation, and a red or pink tinge to the white of the eye are all signs of both types of conjunctivitis.

{"text": "Question: Does it matter if drooling occurs during sleep? \n ### Answer: Most people know that drooling during sleep is a sign of sleep apnea. This condition can be treated easily, so there should not be any complications. Still, there are some other health issues that could be causing your problem to persist. Let\u2019s talk about what causes drooling during non-REM sleep. If you suffer from this condition, then you may want to seek treatment from a dentist.\n\nSleep Apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition where the sufferer stops breathing for a short time and then starts up again. This is caused by blocked airways or enlarged tonsils. Oral appliances can help treat this problem, but a dentist should only prescribe these devices if you really need one. There are many different types of oral appliances available, but not everyone qualifies for them. Sleep apnea can become deadly if left untreated, so this problem needs to be addressed before you start experiencing drooling during sleep.\n\nTooth Decay. When you have teeth sitting in your mouth all night, they collect food particles and bacteria. This causes dental caries, which can lead to serious cosmetic problems. If you have decayed or infected molars, you can prevent this by putting a layer of dentures over your lower front teeth. Although there are health concerns associated with dentures, they can also reduce drooling during sleep.\n\nTMJ Syndrome. A degenerative condition that affects your jaw and temporomandibular joints, TMJ syndrome is not fully understood but there is evidence that links TMJ to nighttime grinding and clenching, also known as bruxism. Sleeping with your mouth open can also cause this problem, so it\u2019s important to sleep with your mouth closed. If you grind your teeth, a dentist may recommend using a dental appliance, but there are also oral medications that can help alleviate the problem.\n\nTMJ is characterized by pain in the jaw and ear, as well as pain in the neck and shoulders. This condition can be very uncomfortable because the intense nerve pain will affect your ability to sleep. It can seem like a constant flow of pressure is pressing against your head. TMJ can also prevent you from going to sleep on your side, a position that makes it difficult to open the mouth and chew food.\n\nSleep Apnea.

{"text": "Question: Can I take Wellbutrin and lexapro together, or would I have to get off the Wellbutrin? \n ### Answer: Lexapro and Wellbutrin are both two medications that are commonly used to treat patients that are diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Buffin is a common generic drug name for Wellbutrin. Lexapro is under the name Escitalopram (generic). Both medications can also be used to help treat patients that have anxiety or mood disorders. Both of these medications can be prescribed for day-to-day use in order to help patients better control their mood swings and to help them reduce the overall effects of mood swings that they are experiencing. It has also been proven that the dual use of these medications is associated with an increased sense of control overall over mood and depression, in many individuals. If you are interested in trying out these medications to see if they will help you, you should check with your doctor first. Sometimes a doctor will want you to try only one medication at a time, or it may be up to you to decide which one you think will be the best for you to start with. Take your time to think on this important decision and be sure that you are currently able to adapt to the changes that these medications may cause. Both of these medications may cause some additional side effects, but most often the side effects are mild. Those with depression tend to find that there are more pros to this option such as increased energy, increased sex drive and an increased feeling of being overall more awake than they have been. This can be very helpful for people that have been feeling tired, irritable or less sexual lately. Keep in mind that you may be more unstable than you normally would be as you begin taking one or both of these meds. They are often used as a last resort for people that are in a family history of severe depression, anxiety or those that have experienced severe mental health challenges in the past."}

Yeast grows quickly under certain conditions, including heat, moisture, andertain medicines or supplements.\n\nCandida albicans is the most common type of yeastthat causes vaginal infections, although other types of fungi can cause infection too. Sex with a new partner can increase the risk of getting yeast infections, and it can prevent some medications from working properly.\n\nHow is vaginal yeast infection diagnosed?\n\nThe two most common methods doctors use to diagnose yeast infections are\u2026looking at a sample of vaginal discharge under a microscope and doing a \u201cculture,\u201d where a swab of the vagina is checked in a lab. The doctor may have to do more than one test to make a diagnosis; sometimes these procedures may be uncomfortable, or they may not separate yeast from another type of infection.\n\nDiagnosis of infections usually is based on history and symptoms, not on the lab results.\n\nCan the baby get a vaginal yeast infection from the mother?\n\nNo, but it is common for babies born to mothers with yeast infections to have yeast infections of their own. These usually are of the mouth, and are common in newborns. These yeast infections of the mouth usually disappear on their own in a few days, but it is good to consult the doctor, as sometimes the mother will help the baby get cured sooner.\n\nContact us today!

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has adverse effects on multiple organ systems resulting from intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation.  One organ system affected is the lungs due to the direct effects of occlusion on the upper airway leading to hypoxia and increased respiratory effort responses from the lungs. It is also indirectly affected through the neurobehavioral and metabolic effects of the long-term fragmented sleep.\n\nFrom a screening perspective, sleep apnea impacts daytime symptoms that include breathing-related disorders, fatigue, extreme sleepiness and unintentionally falling asleep during the daytime.

{"text": "Question: Will that drug interfere with peripheral Neurotherapy? \n ### Answer: This is actually a pretty common question asked by potential clients.\n\nThere is no direct answer to this question, it depends quite a lot on what drug is involved.  However, there is more we can say.\n\nDrugs don\u2019t have a simple effect on the brain. A drug affects what the brain is already doing. Consider this analogy of a car suddenly forced off the road into a large mud puddle. To get going again, motion is needed. To accelerate, motion is necessary.  Power is nothing without some action. This action may be moving forward, moving sideways, or, theoretically, moving upside down.  A variety of possible actions are available. But before any option can be chosen, analysis is needed about barrel roll or a catapult jump off the car.  So it seems that action might depend on operating brain systems, and could collapse if another operating brain system is removed. Experimental & Theoretical Immunology (1997) 126(1), 184\u2013191.\n\nThe amount of motion (energy) required to need to accelerate away from the on any back tire varies relative to the residual traction provided by the road.  The amount of motion the brain needs to overcome any drug side effects also varies. Between two drugs, sides effects may occur because a subset of the drugs side effects overlap with a subset of the treatments side effects.\n\nSo what does this have to do with drugs interfering with BrainCore Therapy?\n\nAny therapy with affects the brain, whether the drug is working for the drug or for the drug?\n\nThere are several examples of this behavior in brain research.  For example, interfering brain activity with one type of brain wave (alpha) had the immediate effect of reducing seizures but the confound was that the therapy was mixed with the same type of brain wave as the seizure. This doesn\u2019t mean that there therapy wouldn\u2019t work. but what it does mean is that results will undoubtedly vary by patient and by condition.\n\nThat being said, there are a few pieces of advice we can give. First, take your medication as prescribed and don\u2019t change the dosage level for the duration of the neurotherapy treatment. Second, strive to keep your medication the same for the duration of treatment. New medications can have interesting effects. For example, the company that"}

Also, if there are issues associated with having an iud installed during your period (like things interrupting insertion or making it take longer) it doesn\u2019t seem to affect the efficacy which is actually very reassuring knowing the insertion can be avoided with your period.

The blood or discoloration test will be pointless if strep is absent, as ARUP's sign is immunmediated.\n\n   in   datetime\n\nThis is an unknown problem with a lot of potential answers.  If you finish reading all the references, you are still left with a basket of logical possibilities.  I list them below.  Since it starts 'suddenly'- implying possible cause and effect, and that narrows it nicely, I'd suggest a visit to the docs.  If it were me, I'd be tempted to request strep throat testing if my general practitioner did not do it.  I am aware that he told you the reason- who knows, but he will certainly not describe the reason for his wanting to test for that.  Obviously, it is narrow enough to start testing, and hence many professionals would begin with this test.  It is also an explanation for the rash.  But it is normal that strep throat may have no symptoms, so testing for it is to an extent sensor testing.\n\nAfter looking at the photos (thank you - this drives up the popularity attractive site is used in the shots, and it was important to release as little information as I can do this).  Your description is a bit vague, and your comment about no flu since means at least a week earlier.  That rules out the viral infection that may also result in a predisposed skin rash ( paraoxytoin reaction).  Other conditions that may result in some of what you describe include (most of the below can be dissected even further; some are tangential rather than direct):\n1:  Strep throat test.  Sore throat.  May not show symptoms.\n2:  Mononucleosis-  As one who has been rocked by mono two times, you are easily vague about possible symptoms in the first week.  This is possible.\n2a:  Varicella.  If much uncertainty occurred with this, you may think of flu.\n3:  contact (skin to skin) with animal bite with corona - cat and dogs tend to have mouth infections due to crowding in shelters and in middle class homes."}

{"text": "Question: Anything I can do for pain? \n ### Answer: I understand pets (and toddlers) aren\u2019t great at communicating their experiences. When they\u2019re uncomfortable they can become growls at people, lash out or reluctant to do the things they usually enjoy, so you have to be pretty switched on to know your pet\u2019s behavior. And sometimes, when they are in severe pain, they hide it because they don\u2019t want to let us, their protectors, down. They may have even tried to conceal their behaviour because they have instinctively anticipated that it might anger you and they could wind up punished.\n\nThese are good times (not literally!) natural supplements that reduce pain and inflammation.

{"text": "Question: What is a daily maintenance inhaler? \n ### Answer: A daily maintenance inhaler is a steroid inhaler (which includes a steroid-containing inhaler or a budesonide / formoterol inhaler) that you must use all year round. Steroid inhalers only work in controlled asthma. That is, they don't treat asthma exacerbations. Most people with asthma will need a daily maintenance inhaler. Some people also just need a daily maintenance inhaler and no reliever. This will depend on the type of asthma you have. Recovery from asthma, however, is essential to relieve the symptoms of asthma, which may sometimes be difficult to contain. Make sure your asthma is well treated before you stop your daily maintenance inhaler.\n\nChildren under one year of age should not be treated with an inhaler, as inhalation can have serious side effects. Children over 12 months can use a small, low pressure nebulizer without a ventilator, but most children become expert with therapy using the inhaler. And it's much easier to take the inhaler pot with him to the hospital than a nebulizer. Before using an inhaler, it is important to check the manufacturer's instructions to determine the recommended age.\n\nThe inhaler cartridge can also be combined with the cuff of the respirator with the pump for steroid inhalation, which can improve the efficiency of therapy. The use of combined devices allows patients to take the prescribed dose without dose error during long-term use. In this case, the cuff sealed the ventilator with the inhomdiameter. Please note, however, that a lack of steroid doses can reduce the efficacy of long-term treatment.\n\nThe effects of the inhaler include symptom relief (similar to bronchodilator medicine), rapid relief, and long-term relief (3-6 hours). If the asthma attack can not be controlled, increased use of inhalation treatment should be warn by the doctor who prescribes the inhalation.\n\nMost are clear, confused and limited. But inhaling several drugs with different areas of action can be useful: this will improve control of both short- and long-term symptoms and include reliever medicines and long-acting inhalation medicines."}

Over-the-counter forms are available, but you may need stronger prescription medications for severe problems.\n\n## How They Fight Colds and Infections\n\nAntihistamines don\u2019t kill bacteria and viruses directly.

But they\u2019re not well-studied in kids. Always talk to your pediatrician before giving your child medication.\n\nAlso, if you have any other health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or liver disease, different antihistamines act on these in different ways. Some make blood pressure fall. That is dangerous if you take a blood pressure medicine. Some can make sugars lower quickly in people with diabetes.\n\nThere can be side effects, too.

{"text": "Question: Can you just give me a zpack or a week of antibiotics to clear this issue? \n ### Answer: No, this syndrome does not always clear with antibiotics. While you can be prescribed a 10-day course, these won\u2019t treat the infection alone, unfortunately.\n\nWhat is the treatment for gastritis caused by H. Pylori? Doctors will usually prescribe a combination of several antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. Antibiotics impact H.pylori by way of stopping cellular growth or interfering with DNA function. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics for H. Pylori treatment are amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole.\n\nCan you drink alcohol when you have H. Pylori? Many types of drug can interfere with treatment. For example, if you take medications for diabetes, allergies or heart conditions, this may cause problems. People with alcohol dependency should avoid drinking because nothing is out of the question with H. pylori and alcohol usage can make symptoms worse.\n\nWhat is the natural treatment for H. Pylori? H. pylori bacteria can be treated naturally by eating lots of garlic, and increasing intake of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, B and C, zinc, iodine, folate iron, betacarotene, bioflavonoids and probiotics. Eating foods that are rich in iodine.\n\nIs H. Pylori curable with antibiotics? Current treatments for H. pylori consist of a first-line antibiotic regimen composed of two antibiotics prescribed simultaneously along with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). However, it is estimated that approximately 20% of subjects fail to clear infection despite treatment with the current therapy.\n\nDo antibiotics completely rid your body of H. Pylori? Antibiotic use to treat H. pylori infection has been associated with increases in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) up to 31-fold for patients with neonatal intensive care unit stays.

{"text": "Question: Is there a treatment? \n ### Answer: Acromegaly must be treated to try and return the growth hormone levels to normal or to at least return them to the correct adult range. Left untreated, acromegaly can have negative impacts on many other areas of your body, and life expectancy is much shorter than in other, similar conditions (e.g. hypothyroidism or diabetes). Doctors will most likely stop your acromegaly treatment when growth hormone levels are normalized, as many people will experience better quality of life, better sleep quality, and normalization in their health-related problems when they begin treatment.\n\nFor most, several treatment methods will need to be used together \u2013 usually, surgery will be paired with medical treatment or medical treatment will be paired with radiation.\n\nNormal growth hormone levels in humans are below 5.0 ng/mL, while acromegalics have a level of between 15.0 and 200+ ng/mL.\n\nTreatment of acromegaly might be a two stage process:\n\n1.

All you want is to get healing and pain relief. You could ease the pain and reduce inflammation with aspirin, naproxen, and yes, ibuprofen.\n\nThe problem? You are concerned about these medicines and their long term effects on your body. Will they lead to kidney problems? Is there an alternate drug that works better and reduces inflammation?\n\nYou know there is an acute issue right now that causes the pain. You need fast results and a quick fix. Why would you OTC drugs when you know there is no guarantee that they will stop inflammation?\n\nThere is something you may not noticed from your doctors or local pharmacist though. Many people take ibuprofen for fever, aches and pains, reducing inflammation, and arthritis. They don\u2019t think about another problem, a topic we want to mention today.\n\nThe evidence is building that chronic use of ibuprofen may help lower the risk of some cancers. The risks, though, outweigh those benefits when you take the drug briefly and aggressively.\n\nIn this article, we discuss how the drug may harm your body. We will further talk about proven anti-inflammatory that works better than ibuprofen. Once done, you can decide for yourself which one to use as medicine.\n\n### Can Working Better than Ibuprofen Work?\n\nOne of the drugs that you should avoid is ibuprofen. Though this is not the only propriety medication with risks. Many NSAIA products that contains two key substances, naproxen and ibuprofen, have been linked with heart problems and stomach ulcers.\n\nIbuprofen is a category of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Others in this category are indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen (Orudis), naproxen (Naprosyn), and saraprofen.\n\nProducts with ibuprofen"}
{"text": "Question: Or maybe ibuprofen? \n ### Answer: By Susanna Schick (Therapay)\n\nWhen thinking about how to shed their smoking habit, most people head for the nicotine-replacement products to help avoid withdrawal. But a new review of three decades of scientific studies shows just as important is how the brain responds to smoking and to those replacement therapies.\n\nScientists from University College Dublin have reviewed research from 1960 to now questioning how doing more than one thing at a time processes the brain. The paper, \u201dThe effects of nicotine and varenicline on executive attention: a meta-analysis,\u201d was published in Frontiers in Psychiatry.\n\nFour kinds of drugs are used to help people stop smoking: nicotine inhalers, nicotine gum, nicotine patches, and varenicline pills. These drugs don\u2019t contain nicotine, but they act similarly in the brain. People who were addicted to nicotine and had gone through nicotine withdrawal from reducing and stopping smoking were also able to pass similar kinds of cognitive tests upon using these nicotine helper drugs versus a placebo.\n\nThe Dundalk study says neuronal nicotinic receptors and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid are involved in this effect.\n\nSome in previous research have concluded the executive brain function that impulses we don\u2019t respond to. The rationale is that the addiction and subsequent behavior to smoking can be interrupted by targeting this part of the brain. Also other studies have found a genetic basis for that part of the brain when considering quitting smoking such as the G-72 variant of the G1 gene. And the same was also found with the Double Bass SNP in the gene for varenicline effectiveness.\n\nAnother reason for encouraging the use of the dopamine re-uptake blocking drug varenicline could be that the positive effects on the executive function part of the brain may be in a mushroom type sponge-like effect on executive function after the current effects have worn off.\n\n\u201cOur results provide evidence that smoking cessation drugs have a specific impact on cognitive abilities,\u201d the authors write. \u201cVarenicline has even more impact on cognitive abilities than other smoking cessation drugs. Our results point to potential cognitive mechanisms by which smoking cessation drugs"}

{"text": "Question: Will I be in the clear to wear my contacts again once my eyes are no longer red? \n ### Answer: I don\u2019t think we can say how long the use of contacts for you as an individual should be banned based on one inflammatory episode. Options to discuss are: What you can do now: We can discuss with you the factors involved in having eye doctor and using contacts safely. The main goal is to avoid eye trauma or irritation that will trigger sustainable inflammatory episodes and thus affect overall vision. There are contact lenses with an impregnated lubricant inside them specifically for this purpose to increase optical and physiological tolerance with better hydration and stabilized tear film. Topical medication can also be applied directly to the surface of the eye to decrease its reactivity from temporary wash-in. The use of punctal plugs that are small silicone devices you place in small holes in the eyelids can slow down the production and removal of tears from the eyes, and hence improve lubrication and stability. Once we restore the stability of the surface of the eye and remove the factors involved in recurrent episodes of inflammation, the best approach to consider is the use of daily disposable contact lens. Studies show that the use of daily disposable single-use contact lenses is more hygienic and less infections will be contracted because you will be wearing a new sterile set each day. Areas like forestry workers, sports, arts, and any occupation that you hold in which you are exposed to high risk of trauma, wearing any type of contact lens can be more harmful for you. We discuss in the office the limitations and possible solutions to your visual needs at that time even temporarily if we must. Forgetfulness can also become an issue for the use of daily disposable contacts. It also depends for some people sometimes if they lose or break their glasses they get \u201cstucked\u201d without it until a next one is procured for them. We discuss with you the pros and cons of different options for your vision correction, and if you wish to proceed. Along the journey of contact lens wear, explore the option your eye doctor set you with. Remember to always attend your follow up appointments and learn better how to handle your contact lenses to keep your eyes healthier!\n\nErgonics of their use\nInappropriate use of contact lenses is one of the most common causes of eye damage or even blindness.

{"text": "Question: What is empiric treatment? \n ### Answer: Empiric treatment is a drug  regime based on the hypothesis that a particular illness or condition is caused by a predictable combination of microbes or microbes and other possible causes. It relies solely on a positive history and on clinical examination to make the diagnosis; it assumes that the targeted disease entity, modality or cause will respond to the chosen treatment.\n\nImplicit in any empiric treatment is that a diagnosis based on the available evidence will support the chosen treatment. The only advantage to the empiric treatment approach is that it could potentially be applied much earlier in the patient care process, thereby reducing morbidity/mortality.\n\nWhat is not empiric treatment?\n\nEmpiric treatment does not involve the use of proprietary drugs or the use of either alternative or complementary products services or therapies. The underlying philosophy is that of returning to the traditional pathway to reach a diagnosis and applying the appropriate tools to ensure a safe and effective type of therapy.\n\nEmpiric treatment."}

This means a viral sinus infection can be contagious and spread to others. Illnesses spread easily in close indoor environments, like schools, nursing homes or prisons. Basically, any place where people are in close contact, and not just coming into contact with bodily fluids, but sharing common used items: dishes, clothing, blankets, etc. People can pick up the virus simply by being in close contact with infected people.\n\nCold and flu viruses can live on surfaces for several hours. The things that are most often at risk may include tissues, door handles, or light switches. It\u2019s not unreasonable to thoroughly sanitize your home during a cold and flu season. Although it may not eliminate the chance of someone getting ill, it will reduce the possibility of them becoming contagious and spreading the virus to others.\n\nThe thing to understand is: there are many different viral infections, all with different severities, symptoms, and time to resolution. For instance, Influenza A and B viruses may share some symptoms and offer complications, but they don\u2019t always spread to others the same way. A viral sinus infection doesn\u2019t happen the same way every time. And head and body aches are common in the early stages of a viral infection. So, anytime you\u2019re sick, if you\u2019re concerned about sinus pain and pressure, it\u2019s always a good idea to talk to your doctor."}
{"text": "Question: Is aquaphor Vaseline? \n ### Answer: ## Product Material\n\nOne of the main ingredients that make the two products different is the material they are made of. Aquaphor is made of the petroleum jelly that contains a mixture of Isoparaffin, mineral oil and a thread of important ingredients including cetyl alcohol and lanolin oil. It is the moisturizer and a great skin protector.\n\nThe Vaseline petroleum jelly is 100% pure that makes Aquaphor a proper substitute for Vaseline petroleum jelly. However, both products have the same healing properties even though Vaseline is 100% pure petroleum jelly whereas aquaphor has added ingredients including bismuth oxide and phenoxyethanol\n\n## Product function\n\nThe Aquaphor is a great protector for the cracked skin which is very useful for the people who suffer from skin diseases. The products are meant to heal your cracks and seal them to prevent them from getting bigger. The aquaphor acts as a carrier of the active ingredients which are necessary to fight allergies and rashes.\n\nOn the other hand, the Vaseline is a workhouse for the softening and moisturizing the human skin. Its petroleum jelly prevents the moisture loss from the human skin and this make it good protector.\n\n## Side effects mental cost\n\nAlso, one comparison of the two products is in the side effects you should be aware of when using them. Aquaphor has no signs of toxic effect that is why it is safe to use. Aquaphor does not cause clogging of the pores, discoloration, or any other side effect.\n\nVaseline is not safe for consumption that is why people are warned against ingesting it. Furthermore, it can cause infections, allergies, and blockages in the nose.\n\n## Spending cost\n\nIn post-scar velvety and subtle canvas case, the Aquaphor is available in a 10ml and 30ml sizes. The Aquaphor brand retails for about $25 per 30 oz to $15 for 15 oz and $10 for 7 oz.\n\nThe Vaseline consists of different types of petroleum jelly. It has a $25 support present that can pay for up to 4,000 gallons of petroleum jelly. The Vaseline is also available in many"}
{"text": "Question: Should I be taking anything else OTC? \n ### Answer: Maybe.There are certain supplements that are used by our patients a fair number of times as well. We have found the following particular products to be helpful:\n\n\u2013 Bacopa: use for cognitive and central nervous system related issues\n\n\u2013 Andrographis: use for weird feeling which may be viral related or for stimming down high androgens.\n\n\u2013 Oracyte: use to improve tone, coordination and balance\n\n\u2013 Thorne adrenal cortex: use to help if adrenal inflammation is believed to be contributing.\n\nDr. Fairchild typically is recommending at least one supplement for his patients. We typically recommend Vitamin D, above this suplement we may also recommend one of the following: CoQ10, Vitamin K2 / MK7, Magnesium, Curcumin, GABA, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Ashwaganda or some Vitamin A from fish oil.\n\nVaccinations\n\nThere is much disinformation and confusion around this subject.The official stance is that immunization is safe. But we may want to consider vaccine safety issues especially because the ASD population tends to having a genetic-deficiency which may predispose it to an inability to clear vaccines within approximately 6 days.Currently we are recommending (4 dose vaccine schedule) 3rd DTaP, and PCV at ~ months and implied delayed vaccination schedule whereby waiting 6 months after each immunization where there is a notable reaction.\n\nGetting your child off Chellityin.com\n\nDevelopmental Pediatric Associates have been quite successful in using chelation to treat patients with metal toxicity. Having seen the effect of metal toxicity and chelation in the 30 years of experience, combined with a literature analysis we are often able to discern when chelation is likely to have been overused or misused. Many conditions which have been attributed to Mercury intoxication may in fact be allergic conditions. In many cases, the child may have had a language delay or language and/or thinking delay due to allergy or brain injury from the chelation. Sometimes oral and non-food allergy are being lumped together with chelation in the inappropriate belief that chelation treats either directly or indirectly Chelation also is not indicated for vital signs which are stubborn, e."}

{"text": "Question: Zoloft Is the antidepressant? \n ### Answer: What is Zoloft?Zoloft is a medicine used for the treatment of various anxiety and depression infections of adult people. Zoloft also suppresses premature ejaculation problems and panic disorder in adults. It is a brand name for the generic drug sold under the name Sertraline. Sertraline]is the main ingredient making up the drug generally known as Zoloft.  This drug is known to be a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, the SSRi.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that primarily affects the emotions of the person. During depressions, there is a lack of Serotonin release in the brain. It will significantly affect the way we feel emotions such as sadness, fear, anger, panic, and anxiety. Sertralin disorder treats depression and anxiety by stabilizing the fluctuations of serotonin levels in the human brain.[Zoloft works by balancing the serotonin levels. Depending on the severity of your condition, Zoloft may cure you of your illness in a few weeks, a few months, or even a very few months. Treating depression is not easy and will require regular monitoring by your physician, as some people suffer the symptoms after taking Zoloft for a while or even after stopping the dosage. That is why you should inform your physician if you feel tired, have stomachaches, experience Impotence at Order Generic Viagra, sleep too much or too little, suffer from transformations in body weight, you hurt yourself as if in the case of attempting suicide, you observe unexplained pain in your body, have ongoing thoughts about death, and have irrational feelings of worthlessness.]"}
{"text": "Question: Also, what may cause this type of bacteria? \n ### Answer: Sources of Bacterial Infections\n\nIf you got any of the germs described above, you probably got them from another person who was already infected with them.\n\nIf you suspect the source of the infection, stay away from it. If you can\u2019t avoid it\u2014or don\u2019t know where you caught the bacteria\u2014this information may become important later.\n\nSome of the most common places bacteria come from are:\n\n- The mouth or throat. Bacteria can spread from your mouth and throat to other parts of your body in two ways. Some bacteria can enter the bloodstream when you have a toothache or an inflamed gum. Other bacteria spread when you touch your mucous membrane\u2014the type of tissues inside the mouth and throat\u2014with your hands, then touch another part of your body or a surface that other people touch.\n- The skin. Bacteria can spread from your skin to another part of the body when you scratch an insect bite, cut, or rash, then touch yours or another person\u2019s mucous membranes or genitals.\n- The digestive system. Bacteria can enter the intestinal tract from many sources. You can breathe the bacteria in when you don\u2019t wash your hands after going to the bathroom and then handling food. The bacteria may be passed along indirectly from people who haven\u2019t washed their hands after going to the bathroom. Food can also be contaminated, then spread the bacteria, such as when raw meats come into contact with other foods.\n- The urinary system and the genitals. These subjects aren\u2019t very comfortable to discuss, but they need to be because bacteria can easily spread in these areas and in the genitals of both men and women.Urinary and genital tract infections can spread in two main ways:\n-     - From one part of the region to another. That means that an infection in the bladder or urethra may spread to the testes and seminal vesicles in men, or ovaries and C-shaped uterus in women.\n    - From inside the body, such as the intestinal tract, to the exterior of the body, such as the urethra. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve provided information throughout this section on how to prevent the spread of bacteria and other germs from the intestines, which are often the first place germs"}

If you have severe allergies, you should consult your doctor to find out what would best work for you.\n\nIf you haven't been using flonase at all prior to start out, I would give you one or two sprays per nostril for a few days and see how you feel.

Is this true?\n\n Tetracycline is one of the medicines sometimes used to treat lymphedema patients. This article linked to below explains tetracycline's mechanism of action in detail:\n\nHowever, the amount of tetracycline in skinIt has been shown that tetracycline penetrates the skin fairly well, according to the experiment reported in this article:\n\nUnfortunately, no one has done a placebo-controlled, double-blind study to find out if tetracycline actually helps reduce lymphedema, so the evidence of its effectiveness is anecdotal. It is also difficult to figure out whether the observed benefits come from tetracycline specifically or from its appetite-suppressing effect. Obesity may be a contributing factor to lymphedema, so losing weight could in itself decrease swelling.\n\nIn one randomized, controlled trial, T4F was more effective than\n\nshould I continue to take the antibiotics I've been prescribed for me or my child?\n The Journal of Lymphatic Research recently published a paper discussing the effects of antibiotics, in particular tetracyclines, on ME/CFS symptoms. It concluded that:\nNote that tetracyclines only work against bacteria. Viruses, such as herpes, remain unaffected and may be causing your problem. Many ME patients believe that herpes virus is a prime culprit.  However, we have no way of testing this belief.  If it is not, then tetracycline or a related antibiotic is unlikely to have a lasting effect; it may provide temporary relief, but the swelling will soon return.  If it is, and you take tetracycline, then you should do a course of at least two months to permanently eliminate this problem.  However, do not continue it indefinitely.

So now I am fully wondering!! I understand blaming bv on Bacteria but yeast? I thought supposedly it's an invasion from the outside world that causes yeast infections.. what do you guys think? I mean it makes sense on some levels since you are more likely to have a yeast infection if you have an intact hymen, but then it sounds strange cause the are pro-hymen tissue??? also I understood it was asexually reproducing and was not \"inborn\" as with bacteria???? What the heck is going on and what's reality???\n\nThe doctor automatically put me on the \"single-use\" mini herself and I FINALLY got a yeast infection because my period was coming on. I feel like a month later I can't have a yeast infection TWO MONTHS AGAIN, not when my period wasn't coming on this month.\n\nCan yeast infections be caused by an outside world infection going inside the body and invading it? Bending that around to be BC, but just curious if anyone has any answers.. thanks..."}
{"text": "Question: Or does dayquil already contain the acetaminophen? \n ### Answer: - DayQuil^{\u00ae} and Nyquil^{\u00ae} pain reliever/cough products contain acetaminophen; Tylenol^{\u00ae} pain relief products (including tablets and liquid over-the-counter) contain acetaminophen. Overdoses may result in severe, occasionally fatal, liver damage. More than half the adult recreational drug overdose deaths in the United States result from people taking too much of over-the-counter pain relievers containing acetaminophen. Never take more than one product containing acetaminophen at a time, unless specified by a doctor.\n\nUse them together with the DayQuil and Tylenol box art below:\n\nSo I don't understand why you ask this.\n\n- There's a slight risk of accidental overdosing in such cases, and people are probably advised to take pains to not accidentally overdose on the pain-relievers.\n\n    - No there isn't, because the boxes include a warning that you shouldn't mix two things that have acetaminophen in them without specially considering that you're doing so, and don't drink while taking them anyway becauase that always makes your upset stomach feel worse but also lightheaded. The exact same warning.\n        - But if Dayquil only contains two ingredients, you'd expect the warning to be in the singular, but it's quite obvious that one needs to look at the ingredient list to know what the warning is suggesting. I feel like having two sperate inserts is a lot easier to understand and might be \"deemed sufficient by the FDA.\""}
{"text": "Question: Are there any warm compresses I can buy at the store that would be more efficient? \n ### Answer: Hello, you have asked a question that must be measured and rated many times, addressing factors such as quality and price. For example, if you take a home-made warm compress, the quality is outstanding but much cheaper for most, but the bargaining for the warmth and convenience is exchanged. It's a shame to compromise on choosing warm pads with great heating quality at a reasonable price.\nIn choosing a warm pad, the most important thing in terms of cautious review of warmth, heat protection and convenience are the three key elements that must be taken into account. The brand Q-ray heating pad can meet many types of heating needs, so creaming can cover everything.\n\nOn the contrary, warming creams purchased from the supermarket, they can only meet general heating needs.\n\nAlso, it takes quite a bit of time to put on a warm cream, should not take a lot of time to warm up, sitting at high temperatures for a long time, as these can actually cause pain.

I was not ready to give up entirely and try something else right away.\n\nAmy Cooper Editor-in-Chief of Natural Health Magazine\n\n\u2022 We have a whole story on the PPI treatment for eyebrow restoration in our April 2016 issue.\n\n\u2022 Baseline: If you start taking these supplements after your eyebrow hair is already falling out, it the age of the new hair growth depends on the length of your telogen (the \"resting\" phase, which is the time between when eyebrow hair falls out and new hair is regrown) phase at the time \u2014 it can be anywhere from one to three months.

Try to avoid putting products that contain aloe vera or other plants that can damage your hair. The one exception for the medical community is anti-inflammatory Echinacea.

{"text": "Question: Do you think the pain during intercourse was normal? \n ### Answer: No! Your vagina is supposed to feel good, regardless of your life stage or whether or not you are having sex. Pain during intercourse is not normal, it is a sign that something is wrong. Inadequate lubrication and a wide variety of vaginal conditions can lead to pain, and inadequate lubrication is invariably the biggest issue. Friction leads to inflammation and inflammation is a key problem in a variety of health concerns.\n\nAge and hormones\nThe older you are the more likely and more impactful is altered lubrication. The more time that has elapsed since menopause the higher the likelihood that your vagina is not producing adequate lubrication for you to feel like sex is \u201csexy\u201d. Less lubrication means more friction leading to irritation and/or inflammation. Pain during intercourse is a good barometer for readiness for use of a lubricant. If you need a lubricant, try using Good Clean Love Almost Naked personal lubricant.\n\nSome women mistakenly believe that they are not producing enough lubrication when they are really producing good lube, but the addition of hormonal suppressants like spironolactone, or hormonal additions, like estrogen supplementation, contract the size of your vaginal canal and diminishing your natural lubrication. It is best to get ride of the calcine strontium that pushes aside the collagen and elastin that should be keeping your vaginal walls your size.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with inadequate lubrication?\nComputed tomography (CT) and histology scans show that inadequate lubrication leads to vaginal wall inflammation and trauma that may impact the well-being of your vagina. This increased friction causes micro-tearings and can also aggravate vaginal lesions, ulcers, warts and inflammatory conditions. While visually it can be difficult to see, if your vagina is pink and swollen, it is unhealthy and the best way to keep inflammation at bay is to use a silky smooth lubricant.\n\nPain during intercourse has been documented, along with urinary incontinence, undergoing cosmetic gynecologic surgeries, like vaginal mesh implants, and persistent with use of \u201cvaginal-dried"}

So if you get pain, and think it's serious, you should go to hospital immediately. Things that cause serious pain include:\n\nif in any doubt, go.\n\notherwise try these:\nconsider searching on the internet for treatment options. Remember to look at reputable websites, though: there is much incorrect information on the internet!\n\nTry taking some simple painkillers. Over-the-counter analgesics come in three main types:\n\n- Paracetamol - the simplest pain reliever and safer to use. Sold under a variety of brand names. It's rapidly absorbed from the gut, so the effects are felt within 20-30 minutes. Effectiveness for moderate to severe pain is not as good as the other stronger analgesics, so suitable only for mild to moderate pain. Possible overdosing is not so dangerous; usually has no serious side-effects.\n\n- Aspirin - the oldest drug anaesthetic and painkiller. Works by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, thus reducing pain. If used in doses less than 600mg, it is safe in children and should be tried first in such circumstances. Side-effects include bleeding (nose bleeding, blood in stools) and reversible changes in the ability to form blood clots - including an increased risk of GI bleeding ('ulcer disease'). Caution in asthmatics. Safe for short-term use, but obviously it isn't safe to give paracetamol chronicly.\n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) - a large group of analgesics, which also have powerful anti-inflammatory (and other) actions. This class of drugs includes ibuprofen, aspirin, ketoprofen, and many more. They work by having analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory actions typically through inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Adults are not at increased risk of GI adverse effects, but the young are, particularly under the age of 12. They work well for"}

{"text": "Question: Can I take med for pain? \n ### Answer: If your symptoms are going to keep occuring no matter what you do, then the proper course of action is to get medication of some type for it. Since it seems like you have trigger points, then I would recommend meds like Endep. It's a tricyclic and it's really good for nerve pain like the kind you have. They're also most likely treating that over the anatomy they see, and the two doesn't always match, so it's needlessly costing you money for shots that shouldn't be going into your spine.\n\nDrugs of last resort in these types of situations would be either fentanyl or morphine patch, take as needed, as they elevate the overall pain tolerance to a degree that doesn't leave you feeling as much pain as before. Prior to those though, I'd check with an EMG facility to see if nerve conduction studies help. If you have been, you didn't mention if you went under them, and they can be extremely invasive in nature and finicky in comparison to other forms of testing."}
{"text": "Question: Is it possible to get oral antibiotics instead ? \n ### Answer: Oral antibiotics can be used instead of Amoxicillin only when there is a specific allergy to the drug and its close substitutes.\n\nOtherwise, amoxicillin for pneumonia is the way to go and repacking the same with an oral solution is high risk.\n\n## Using Amoxicillin Injection for Pneumonia\n\nThis classification comes into play when managing someone with antibiotic resistant neosporosis.\n\nThe median daily dosing for amoxiclin in this respect is 150 mg/kg, with intravenous infusion given two to three times a day.\n\nIn the majority of situations where amoxicillin for pneumonia is given, oral or intramuscular (IM) delivery is sufficient.\n\nThis is based on three facts \u2013\n\na) Sensitivity of the microorganisms involved.\n\nb) Severe bacteremic sepsis in which prolonged treatment over two hours is less useful.\n\nc) Cost effectiveness and patient safety record of amoxicillin via the intramuscular route.\n\nThe drug behaves like its other class members, with apparent untoward side effects frequently being due to previous dose history in individuals.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions about Amoxicillin Abuse\n\nPeople commonly ask if amoxicillin and alcohol may be consumed.\n\nThe official answer is no, not if one has to take the antibiotic for an infection at that time.\n\nBut one should be slightly cautious about this and ask their doctor or drug pharmacist for any possible drug interactions if they intend to consume alcohol while treated with Amoxicillin for pneumonia.\n\nPatients also bond over their chronic or immediate prescribed use of such drugs, and it is then that the illusion they are harmless, and worthy of recreational use is born.\n\nTherefore, there is much more to think about with amoxicillin and its effects on cognition, before one starts using it to get high.\n\nWhat is important to remember is that while there is no evidence of brain developmental or behavioral risks in children due to pharyngitis treatments, alcohol may induce further damage.\n\nThere is little risk that the use of amoxicillin with alcohol will decrease the drug\u2019s effectiveness"}

{"text": "Question: do you think an eye drop antibiotic would be helpful? \n ### Answer: jazzsingsxx\nAn eye doctor trained in the treatment of the eye, including various eye conditions and diseases.\n\nCauses of Styes\nBumps that occur around the eyelid are caused by bacterial or viral infections of the oil glands present in the canal adjacent to the eyelids. When these openings of the glands become infected, they cause the gland to get clogged up leading to the formation of the sty.\n\nDealing with Eyelid Sty\nAntibiotic ointments or eye drops are of no use when it comes to dealing with eyelid styles. Styes (oil gland sty) and hordeola (eyelash follicle sty) are not contagious ailments. But, they can spread because of the way a person touches his eyes. Most of the times, the ointments and eye drops used for urgent use actually make things worse. York Rudich, M.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and an eye doctor says that the sty warm compress cause the bacteria to go under the skin. He also says that the antibiotics only encourage the bacteria to settle in the body, which allows them to invade other parts of the body.\n\nEyelid Sty Treatment\nThe doctor will first try to ascertain whether the sty is a staphylococcus infection or not. In most of the cases it is found that the infection is fungal related, although there are cases where a sty is a staphylococcus infection. Antibiotics can be administered by the eye doctor to eradicate the infection. The opening of the gland that houses the sty needs to be opened if the gland backups are blocked. Eye drops, therefore are of no use. The doctor may apply hot compresses to burst the sty. You may also apply warm washcloths to speed up the drying up of this gland.\n\nPrevention\n\nrub warm washcloth periodically under the eyes every day. if i do this, will it prevent sty from coming back?"}
{"text": "Question: Maybe pusatile tinnitus? \n ### Answer: I found the following, which is related to tinnitus and I assume about someone who used ear plugs/dampeners:\n\nEardrum infection, also known as middle ear infection, is a condition when the eardrum gets inflamed. The infection can be quite painful and may cause hearing problems. The cause of the inflammation is bacteria or a virus that reproduces rapidly, causing excessive production of mucus, leading to infection. The most common type of ear infection is Otitis media or middle ear infection.\n\nPossible causes of eardrum infection include:\n\nA malformed Eustachian tube does not allow air and moisture to drain from the ear, causing fluid build or otitis media.\nAntibiotics can weaken the immune system, making the eardrums more susceptible to infection.\nComplications from surgery on the Eustachian tubes.\nExposure to cold air or water entering the ear.\nClosely placed finger when swallowing.\nLoud sounds and volume such as playing music too loud or attend a concert.\nEven once the air is cleared from the ear due to infection, the possibility for a middle ear infection is considerably high. Immediate treatment is advised to prevent the condition from worsening, which may have adverse affects on your ear and hearing.\n\nThe following links, or websites, offer substantial reference material for the topic I obtained through http://www.fitday.com/... which might be of interest:\n\nhttp://www.kidshealth.org/kid/...\nhttp://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/1215/p2481.html\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Eardrum..."}

{"text": "Question: Is it true that taking L Lysine helps reduce outbreaks? \n ### Answer: Lysine is an amino acid that is produced naturally by the human body. Unfortunately, production may be insufficient to support an active body. Additionally, people who are dieting or those who restrict their consumption of red meat may not be getting enough lysine from their diets to contribute to healthy bodily systems. Regardless of if lysine needs to be supplemented into one\u2019s body, it can decrease the amount of time that a cold sore lasts and possibly even the amount of attack\n\nAre you sure L Lysine prevents and cures cold sores?\nWhen taken in high doses, lysine has been known to help inhibit herpes outbreaks and promote the healing of cold sores. Lysine is an amino acid that directly competes with arginine for absorption in the small intestines. Arginine stimulates viral production. Lysine is needed to make antibodies and plays a role in repairing damaged areas. It has also been known to help improve foggy night vision. Studies have shown that developing resistance to the herpes virus may be possible by taking L Lysine. The problem is that there is an overwhelming amount of conflicting data on the efficacy of lysine in curing colds sores, especially in number of people who do not seem to benefit from it\u2019s use.\n\nIs there anything else that will cause lysine to react with certain cells? Do you think there is a danger for an individual to react with synthetically grown lysine?\nLysine in conjunction with Vitamin C has been shown to turbo charge cells that help generate collagen tissue. L-lysine is marketed for such things as strengthening cartilage and maintaining the health of connective tissue. These are properties that lysine does not have on its own. Humans produce lysine on there own and therefore recognize it as a natural part of the supplementation the body processions. However, too many types of lysine produce a different essential amino acid which interferes with cells that are responsible for the production of the biologic AT3I enzyme. These cells produce insulin. Getting too much lysine or having the wrong type of lysine may lead to insulin resistance.\n\nwhat kind of food i can get lysine from?\nYou can find lysine in protein rich foods"}
{"text": "Question: Do you recommend I take medication immediately, or wait till morning to start? \n ### Answer: The main indication that it\u2019s time to start your thyroid medication is \u201cright before\u201d or \u201cduring breakfast,\u201d or about 30-60 minutes before eating. As you\u2019ll see in the list under the paragraph \u201cWhat Seconds Does the Thyroid Medication Do?,\u201d the goal of this medication is to allow ample time for the thyroid hormone to make its way into your system. In a morning ingestion of thyroxine medication, the best performance will happen at the end of the dosing.\n\nSo, if you are already taking your medication early in the morning, it might be safe to take your meds at this hour and then start over. Try starting another course of thyroid medicine, taking it in the afternoon with some additional serotonin (just don\u2019t take them together!). The next morning, you should be taking your thyroid meds right before mealtime and after about an hour with your serotonin. And by the end of the day, when you stop your thyroid meds, dose them with an hour\u2019s worth of serotonin. The breakdown in serotonin by the time your body reaches your thyroid is similar to that of your metabolism when taking thyroxine alone.\n\nHow long will I have to stay on the thyroid medications after the replacement begins?\n\nAccording to Modern research, patients may have to stay on their thyroid medication long after the initial replacement. Some patients have reported improvement with thyroid medication therapy over a 12-18 month period. Other patients have experienced no improvement or worsening and perhaps even no improvement at all in their symptoms over 12-18 months. With that said, in some patients, the benefits will likely continue and improve with continued use. However, for others they may remain indefinitely as a permanent solution. For those patients, the replacement will continue with a prescription that includes the thyroid supplement that has helped maintain health. For some, this is a temporary replacement.\n\nIs the therapy different for men or women?\n\nIt is common for some women to see improvement with thyroid medication replacement as opposed to some men, but, for most, it is not significantly different. For a small number of men, the benefits may be less clear. There are also some women who experience little to no, or even reduced, benefit from thyroid replacement. In such cases, the benefits"}

{"text": "Question: Does blepharitis cause redness of the eye like conjunctivitis does? \n ### Answer: It is a common dilemma entered by most eyelid inflammation patients.  As you already know, conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the conjunctivae (the inner layers of the eyelids and the sclera of the eye), while blepharitis means inflammation of the eyelids. Blepharitis with redness affects the eye margin and the front surface of the eyelids.\n\n## Blepharitis Appearance and Symptoms\n\nBlepharitis symptoms present as itching, tearing, pain, irritation, swelling and inflammation of the eyelids. It is normally a chronic disorder, meaning recurrent periods of flares and remissions.  Normally even during remission the patient may notice scaly skin of the eyelids, dryness of the eyelid margins and a foreign body feeling.\n\nBlepharitis patients may suffer from various severities of inflammation and a single patient can go through periods that require medical intervention and periods that do not.  And, most blepharitis cases do not cause redness in the eye itself.\n\n## Difference Between Blepharitis and Conjunctivitis\n\nWhat is the difference between blepharitis and conjunctivitis? Look at their meanings\u2026.. The definition of conjunctivitis is \u2018inflammation of the conjunctiva\u2018 and blepharitis is defined as \u2018inflammation of the eyelids\u2019.\n\nConjunctivitis and blepharitis is not the same thing. Both are however two common chronic ocular problems that lead to redness in the eye, irritation, itchiness, tearing, grittiness, pain, swelling and irritation.  Short \u2018Conjunctivitis\u2019 is also well known as \u2018Pink eye\u2019, the most common ocular condition among everybody, from children to adults.\n\nConjunctivitis is in fact a condition that leads to redness in the eye and in the eyelid margin,  just like blepharitis, but most atypical cases of blepharitis do not cause redness of the eye itself. These two conditions have few common causes. They are caused by microorganisms, allergens and also simply by oil gland dysfunction.\n\n## What is the Action Plan for B"}

However, there can be situations where this may not be the case.\n\nTylenol/IBuprofen/Aleve Advil Combination\n\nIbuprofen (Motrin or Advil) and Tylenol and Aleve Aspirin are used to treat moderate to severe pain as well as inflammation (such as due to arthritis or soreness). If you are taking ibuprofen either single or with Tylenol and painkillers such as Tramadol, codeine or other narcotic opioids, consulting your doctor about the safety of using the drug combination during HIV treatment is certainly necessary.\n\nAcetaminophen And Acitretin\n\nAcitretin is an oral form of the vitamin A. Treatment with acitretin is normally combined with the topical application. Your doctor will recommend an application of the drug on the skin 1-2 times a day for a shorter course (about 8 weeks). Then the treatment will be case-by-case. Combining acitretin with alleviating pain, such as acetaminophen, Advil and Naprosyn may be beneficial in applying topical acitretin. At the same time, you should consider consulting your doctor regarding the likely effect of the combination of antibiotics and these pain relievers.\n\nAmoxicillin And Paracetamol\n\nAmoxicillin is the substance that belongs to beta-lactam, penicillin antibiotics. Amoxicillin acts against bacteria by inhibition of their production of cell wall protein. Paracetamol, also known as Acetaminophen, is mostly used for reducing fever and treating inflammation (in case of flu or cold). Amoxicillin can not only cure sore throat but it can also help in reducing fever.

{"text": "Question: Can styes be on other areas of the eyelid besides just the edges? \n ### Answer: It does happen. But, usually your eyes will let you know there is an infection brewing. The tricky ones happen with the tiniest of eggs all along the edge. It helps to watch for the initial inflammatory particles, which are the clear ones before they group together in a milky one-celled bacteria. They are usually around an eyelash or on the edge of your lid. Sometimes with blepharitis there are two or three tiny nodules lining the edge. With any lump be extra diligent with hygiene.\n\nEven though other areas of the eyelid can be infected, they are not as common in the tear trough or medial aspects near the nose or toward the temple. Other regions usually have adenitis with glands underneath at risk."}

I took it several years ago though. So while I was on it the last time, the belief that it should work right is probably wrong. The same drug I can take as a child, but as an adult I should be able to control myself from getting sick? Also, I still feel funky for a while after taking it. Of course, I didn't know that this time. Other than my arms that I shook for an hour? I got feverish, I feel really funky and it gives me a headache all day long. No matter what I take, once I take the meds it takes the bad out of me and I feel really funky. Which means invincible either.

What you need to do is to gulp too much water so that your throat will not be dry all the time. You may also add some salt so that any swelling in the throat will be lessened due to the saline effect that it will have.\n\nBut if your sore throat is caused by other factors, go and ask your doctor for immediate medical attention.

{"text": "Question: I have snored so loudly in my life, could this be related to the cough? \n ### Answer: Q.\n\n## Can nasal congestion cause snoring?\n\nCrowded nasal tissues can lead to obstruction of nasal airways. Air can flow easily through your nose when the passage between your nose and throat is open. Not only can nasal congestion cause noise and snoring, it can also be a cause of sinus infection.\n\n## What causes snoring with a cough?\n\nSnoring is a common sleep problem and some experts estimate that more than 85% of people experience it at some point in their life. Snoring is simply a mechanical compromise of the respiratory tract, typically via increased soft tissue in the lips, along the nose, tongue, and palate or lower jaw.\n\n## Is snoring a sign of underlying conditions?\n\nMany conditions can cause snoring. Anatomical problems of the respiratory system Airway obstructions like fatty tissue in throat or enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Nasal obstruction with deviated septum, polyps, allergies, and sinus infection, all constrict the upper airway and cause snoring.\n\n## Can flu meds make you cough?\n\nA. The antitussive drugs are cough suppressants and include guided syrups, Honey-based cough remedies and cough confections. They include codeine and diphenhydramine, among others. These drugs relieve coughs caused by infections such as flu, cold and coronavirus as well as postnasal drip, allergies and asthma.\n\n## Is snoring a good sign of a cold?\n\nIf you're a snorer, you might not be getting the sleep you think. A recent study suggests that snorers suffer short-term brain damage from insomnia and incomplete sleep patterns, which can lead to increased chances of memory loss, heart problems and early death.\n\n## Is Snorting fluconazole safe?\n\nAdults and children over 5 years old\u2014 Oral dosing is usually taken orally (by mouth) once or two times a day, Oral dosing Oral dosage was administered using a variety of methods including Albuterol, Albuterol, Doxazosin (Lasix), Albuterol UDFA Adverse effects include slight nausea, dizziness, angina"}

Hounded to no end for oral antihistamines to help with the redness, itching, tearing, and just plain irritation.\n\n### Museum collections and extent of damage\n\nBecause wind exposure causes pollen to settle in our homes, windows, and in our bedding, it seems that antihistamine sales seem to correlate with slightly higher temperatures. People want a drug to help with eyes that itch and feel awful.\n\nOne of the first drugs was now simply labeled in our country as the \u201cgood pill.\u201d Benadryl is a hydroxyzine compound. -Inside our office and  in our clinic, this is the most commonly used oral antihistamine.\n\nWhat has become clearer over the years is that this drug can have sedative side effects. They are generally considered to be runny, lethargic and sleepy. It also allows us to not be stressed by the itchy, watery eyes that drive us nuts. It works well enough but now there are now asthma concerns and more sedation.  Not a great combination\u2026\n\nDiphenhydramine works well enough when it comes to eye itching. It does get a bit of a bad reputation when you drive, need to work or need to be alert \u2013  so there is some difficulty as far as side effects go.\n\nOthers like loratidine and cetirizine are now readily available and easily obtained in our local drug store.\n\nEven Zyrtec"}

{"text": "Question: What would be the treatment for a bacterial ear infection? \n ### Answer: If the patient complains of hearing loss, I\u2019d suspect a middle ear infection.  What if the patient had hearing loss and you treated the suspicion of the ear infection and didn\u2019t resolve the hearing loss?  What if inner ear infections (otitis media with effusion) aren\u2019t necessarily treated with the typical oral antibiotic therapy?\n\nRecent studies on the microflora of the ear have been really eye opening to the various ways the microbes influence the physiology and crystal structure formation of the middle or inner ear.   If the patient has continual or prolonged hearing loss after a middle ear infection, one needs to consider what\u2019s causing the pathology.  Typical treatment of acute otitis media is believed to be oral antibiotics with recommendation of follow up to detect if there are continued symptoms. Typically, the first two to four days after a suspected clinical diagnosis, there are typically leukocytes (WBCs) present in the ear effusion due to the infection. If the fluid has more than 20/HPF or salmon pinkish coloration, the infection is considered acute and treatment is instituted. If adenoid tissue is somehow rubbing on the eardrum, causing inflammation, then surgery may be indicated. Typically, if the effusion is present for more than 60 days, the patient is the setting for \u201cadenoid tissue\u201d blocking the Eustachian tube.  So, the physician examines and palpates the lymph nodes, the tonsils and the adeniods for abnormality.  If the tonsils are big, they are removed.  If the adenoids are big, they are removed.  If the adenoids are normal sized, tubes are placed for three months.  If the adenoids are still normal sized and the fluid or fluid levels are still present, the adenoids are removed.

{"text": "Question: Is what I have contagious? \n ### Answer: Young or old, someone you love or someone you live with. If you are unsure, make a call. The Vocational Nurses and Paramedics are there day and night to answer your questions confidentially.\n\nWhat will they do?\n\nA Counselor or Paramedic will go over your health history and miscarriage history with you. They will look at your home life and situation. They will ask you questions about your sexual history and if you have had any unprotected sex already around the time your pregnancy began. They will test you and test your partner (if you bring them in) for STD\u2019s and pregnancy. They will use the information you provide to figure out what might be going on.\n\nThey will tell you the results \u2013 if they are positive or negative \u2013 and discuss options with you including possible treatment. It is completely up to you. You have the final say.\n\nIf I think I am getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI), should I get tested?\n\nUnfortunately, STI\u2019s are sometimes hard to detect. Sometimes they don\u2019t show up for days or even weeks, so it is always smart to be tested if there is any possibility. Some people pick up an STI and have no symptoms and don\u2019t even know they have it. You may be a carrier and spread it to your partner or someone you love. The Vocational Nurses and Paramedics at Women\u2019s Health Specialists are there to test, treat, and examine you when you feel you have an STI or wish to get tested. They will be with you for your journey, and you will never be judged.\n\nWhat are sexually transmitted infections?\n\nBelow is a list of a few common STIs:\n\nChlamydia\n\nChlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infectious in the United States. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that is usually spread through any type of vaginal, anal or oral sex. However, it can be spread to an infant through the birth canal. Chlamydia can infect both sexes and can often be silent. This means that there are often no warning signs and that treatment is necessary to prevent complications and prevent spreading the infection. Chlamydia is often spread when a person has casual, non-monogamous or non-mutually monogamous"}
{"text": "Question: Do I stop taking the omeprazole when I take the protonix and do I start it today or tomorrow morning.? \n ### Answer: Asked: 06/27/03\n\n### Answer\n\nShort answer: no, you don't have to stop taking your regular omeprazole.\n\nIf we were talking about two different PPIs, then as a general rule, the regular PPIs would be stopped and the patient would be put on the NIAID study proton pump inhibitor only for the duration of the study; when the study is completed, then the regular PPI would be reinstated and the patient would continue on it. However, since protonix (pantoprofen) has not been approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), it therefore cannot enter the \"regular\" PPI compartment of the stomach. It can be considered a \"test\" PPI, however, which means that as long as any PPI taken (even if for testing purposes) helps the patient, then the patient should continue on it until the testing period is over (the NIAID study), at which time the regular PPI would be restarted. In short, continue to take the protonix on a once-a-day schedule.\n\nI don't believe, by the way, that omeprazole can ever be discontinued. In fact, I would be suspicious of any physician who would advise such a thing, as it usually means that the physician is one who simply prescribes the PPIs for a while and then never sees the patient again (\"asta la vista\"). It is essential that a PPI only be used on a PRN (as needed) basis in those patients who only get intermittent symptoms. So if your physician has put you on a PPI, such as omeprazole, you should take it on a regular basis for as long as your physician advises.\n\nNIAID: Proton Pump Inhibitor Treatment\n\nBrooks P.

{"text": "Question: Does a CBC show low blood platelets? \n ### Answer: Let\u2019s find out. Thrombocytopenia is caused by low blood platelet counts, meaning less than 200,000 per microliter. Platelets are small cells in the blood that help the blood clot when the blood vessels are damaged. One type of white blood cell closely resembles the platelets, but these cells are involved in the immune system\u2019s response.\n\n## What Happens to the Body When Platelet Count is Too Low?\n\nLow blood platelets can lead to bleeds that can be mild, but severe, to life-threatening.\n\nThese are some of the symptoms that occur: blood in the stool, blood in the urine, blood in vomit, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, bleeding from bruises and blemishes, fatigue, dizziness, headaches, and shortness of breath.\n\nBruising and bleeding are hallmark signs of low platelet count. Platelets band together with each other and step in the blood. The more severe the decrease in platelets, the more severe the bleeding.\n\nA minor head injury or surgery can cause serious bleeding and even death if platelet counts are not adequately restored beforehand.\n\nBleeding can happen inside the body, such as in the brain or gastrointestinal tract, causing neurological or abdominal distress. In these situations, even with normal platelet counts, the bleeding is unnoticed until the bleeding is so severe that it harms the body or organs.\n\nWhen platelet count is low, a blood clot is not formed in the heart, and small particles move or dislodge. If the blood passes through the lungs and heart before it is formed, it could cause a blood clot in the lungs or heart.\n\n### When Does a CBC Show Low Blood Platelets?\n\nNormal, healthy adults should have between 150,000 and 450,000; children have less. This is the most common laboratory test.\n\nThe platelet count is only part of the sequential analysis that follows blood test preparation and inspection.\n\nWBCs and RBCs and blast cells may indicate the presence of infection, disease, or inflammation.\n\n#### How to Naturally Increase Blood Platelets\n\nThere are many ways to"}

{"text": "Question: Is there a pill that can help alongside the cream? \n ### Answer: No problem, there are plenty to choose from.  The skin condition we were looking at last fortnight was also the inspiration for this fortnight\u2019s question; \u201cIs there medication alongside the steroid treatment?\u201d\n\nThe answer is Yes \u2013 there are plenty to choose from and the choice could also depend on how much dermatitis you get.  These will be in gel or cream form and these creams are usually associated with steroid treatment of eczema.  Other pills or over the counter medicines can also be taken, but a check at the pharmacist may be needed before buying as some can\u2019t be taken alongside alcohol, certain medicines, pregnant or if you have any medical conditions.\n\nLactacid, another medicine used to treat eczema, is often in gel form and is used less than it was some time ago.  If you did suffer from eczema and have dry or even cracked, scaling or red skin this medicine may be prescribed to assist dermatitis.\n\nSevere dermatitis that cannot be controlled with cream alone also responds well to steroid medication usually beginning with a powerful effect which eases the skin reaction.  The use should be tapered down avoiding chances of side effects.   But as with so many medicines there are a few people who are allergic to specific steroids or should not take this type because of other conditions or medications.  There may well be a need to stay away from certain skin creams because of latex, perfumes or certain dyes.  Although there are newer steroids being used (Nasalcort and Vectair) they do not prove as effective on the skin."}
{"text": "Question: What is naproxen? \n ### Answer: Is It Safe?\nThe most prevalent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include naproxen, aniracetam, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen. They are used to reduce pain and inflammation brought on by arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual cramps, headaches, back pain, colds, and other ailments, as well as to suppress fever. The discovery that aspirin had anti-inflammatory side effects led to the search for other painkillers (see Aspirin and Ritalin). Naproxen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen are frequently referred to as \u201cnovel NSAIDs,\u201d which indicate that they have unique structures and different properties than the earlier NSAIDs, such as aspirin. Like aspirin, naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Both Aspirin and Naproxen are painkillers that lessen pain, edema (tissue inflammation), and fever. NSAIDs, such as naproxen, function by decreasing natural substances called prostaglandins that cause pain and swelling, but they also reduce blood flow to the stomach wall, which can result in ulcers, stomach pain, or bleeding.\n\nA few NSAIDs are authorized at abbreviated dosages (lower amounts than those approved for adults) for children\u2019s use. Adult and premature infant clinical trials on aleve overdose medicine also indicate that ibuprofen is safer for children than naproxen, and ibuprofen currently holds the advantage in the region of children\u2019s dosages. Previously, deaths had been attributable to the side effects of ketoprofen on the heart and circulation (which sultans use to treat pyrexia). It is currently the last of the major NSAIDs to accept the cardiovascular risk counseling established for others: \u201cBefore beginning any of the products in this group, read the boxed warning and product window card thoroughly and ask your doctor or pharmacist.\u201d Eight ketoprofen and nimesulide-related stomach perforation cases were found by a recent study in children and teenagers who had previously"}

{"text": "Question: Is it still possible its hemorrhoids if there is no itching irritation pain or discomfort? \n ### Answer: The short answer is yes. Hemorrhoids are vessels packed with blood which under normal circumstances should only become obvious through bleeding. When the vessels become small (Internal hemorrhoids) nothing much may be felt. When they expand or inflame (External Hemorrhoids) a lump is usually felt and bleeding may be experienced also.\n\nThere are other reasons which may be responsible for the development of small lump at the anus or on the skin around the anus and these should be ruled out:\n\u2022 Anal fissure: A tear or crack may be felt on the anus and there may be pain associated with this. Chronic anal fissure can be responsible for the anal lump.\n\u2022 Skin tag: A skin tag is associated with long hours of sitting when anal area come in contact with skin tag may be spied on just an area touching the anal skin. This is not as painful as external hemorrhoids but can still be uncomfortable.\n\u2022 Varies of Walsenstein: Very rare presentation of warts annular ulcer around the anus can have a picture that mimics hemorrhoids but is not so.\n\u2022 Obesity: Being overweight can mimic a hemorrhoidal picture by causing or making the lump appear bigger round the anus.\n\u2022 Anal cancer: Malignant anomaly in the region is not so common but it can present as anal lump.\n\u2022 Lymphadenopathy: An enlarged lymph node around the anus can alter the appearance of the anus lump and change the diagnosis slightly.\n\nConclusively diagnosis of hemorrhoid lump should not be based solely on symptoms, however, actual inspection is more suitable when assessing the situation, only then can the most possible diagnosis be established and the appropriate treatment be prescribed. If the lump has an itching pain and discomfort then hemorrhoids is most likely the cause but for ruling out other possibilities inspection of the anal area should be sought."}

I have NEVER had problems skiing in the sun and wearing sun glasses... why me?!!? - thanks guys. Posted 01-11-04\n\nIt depends on what is responsible for the damage to your corneas. It does not sound like a viral cause (although I would not totally discount that possibility). It is very hard to tell from what you are reporting, but if it has been a month since you returned from your ski trip then most likely you do not have any microsporidian parasites (\"CMV\") in your corneas. Most microsporidian infections, even if detected almost a year after exposure, clear up on their own.\n\nAs to what to use on your eyes, I have no idea. There are a variety of possibilities ranging from anything to make sure there isn't a simple bacteria in there to a virus to whatever you have going on with your immune response. The variability is probably what is easiest to explain the uncertain outcome. Some patients have given up on trying to see, live, then one day just \"wake up\" and their vision is returned. Others are stuck with BKs or CMV (and other related ocular injuries) for years.\n\nYour best bet (if you are not getting the help you need alone) is to seek out the advice of an experienced specialist to help figure out what your best approach to your health should be."}

{"text": "Question: is pseudoephedrine the stuff that makes you drowsy? \n ### Answer: How does it make you drowsy?\n\n## Definition of Pseudoephedrine\n\nPseudoephedrine is an off-label therapy used in the care of respiratory disorders such as asthma and nasal congestion, as well as in the treatment of sinusitis. Pseudoephedrine is a class of drugs created from ephedrine but has no known food allergies or interactions with other drugs or alcohol. However, pseudoephedrine has the potential to be highly addictive so individuals with addiction issues should be very careful when taking this drug.\n\n## Dose of Pseudoephedrine\n\nPseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter medication composed of ephedra stems and roots that comes in the form of tablets, capsules, and a solution. It is prescribed to treat nasal and sinus congestion and secondary allergic reactions to the common cold. It should only be used in children over the age of 6 years old and adult dosages vary depending on the type of medication chosen and individual needs (the daily dosage for adults is 30-60 mg while for children it is 10-20 mg). The normal adult dosage of ephedrine is 120-240 mg. Since pseudoephedrine and ephedra are derived from an herbal plant and, as a result, are very different from one another, the recommended dose of one will not guarantee its effectiveness in another. However, they have generally been taken successfully in treating similar symptoms such as sinus infections and cold symptoms.\n\n### Dangers of Taking Pseudoephedrine and Overdose Symptoms\n\nLike all medications, pseudoephedrine comes with a handful of side effects and possible overdose symptoms that if taken properly will border on insignificant. It should always be taken as prescribed by a medical professional and never in combination with any other stimulating products like coffee or energy drinks since it can cause a manic reaction to the active ingredient, or run the risk of a heart attack. Some precautions include: avoiding the medication if you have kidney or hypertension problems, long-term ingestion of tobacco or marijuana, or if you are a female surfer (since it can affect the hormones that benefit surfing).

{"text": "Question: Could a sinus infection cause loss of taste and smell? \n ### Answer: You can develop sinus problems for a number of different reasons. The sinuses and nasal passages can be interrupted due to allergies, physical trauma, or a sinus infection. Not only are these common causes of lost smell, but they can lead to reduced taste.\n\nSinusitis is a common condition that may be linked to changes in both taste and smell. Sinusitis is inflammation, including physical and chemical changes, of the sinus lining. This includes any swelling of and changes to nasal passages, nasal polyps, tissues, and mucus production.\n\nFor some people, this builds a barrier making it hard to smell (also known as hyposmia or anosmia). Your ability to taste can also be affected.\n\nAccording to a , this can occur during any episodes of both acute and chronic sinusitis. Changes in taste and smell have been shown to occur in up to 75% of people with sinusitis.\n\n### Common symptoms of sinusitis\n\nOne sign you may be dealing with sinusitis is a runny nose. This can show up as copious clear or discolored drainage. You can also experience increased nasal congestion or postnasal drip, consistent with a chronic sinus infection.\n\nOther symptoms that may be present, depending on the type of sinusitis you have, are:\n\n- upper tooth pain\n- sore throat, cough\n- redness in ears\n- pain behind or above your eyes\n- headache\n- tenderness over your cheeks and cheeks\n- green/yellow mucous\n\nIt\u2019s very common to notice a change in your sense of smell. Sometimes you can also notice a change in your taste. Keep in mind, despite how much the sensations of smell and taste are intertwined, it\u2019s possible to have loss of one without experiencing a loss of the other.\n\nYou may even notice changes in your palate in the short term. A suggests that sinus infections may lead to increased sensitivity to foods that are highly spiced or acidic.\n\nCommon symptoms of COVID-19 can be harder to differentiate from those of sinusitis. One of the key factors is the duration of symptoms. If symptoms only last a few days, it\u2019s likely not COVID-19.\n\nAs shown in the , people\u2019s"}

{"text": "Question: Will Tylenol or advil help?? \n ### Answer: [This pertains to food poisoning with cramping and loose stools.]\n\nYes, both will help from an acute pain stand point.\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) are the most common pain relievers in the country today. Their main difference is that acetaminophen does not affect the body\u2019s blood platelets. However, it also does not curb inflammation as aspirin, or other NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) does. Yet acetaminophen is safer because of that inflammatory effect.\n\nIn fact, if you take too many NSAIDS, you can actually cause stomach bleeding or hemorrhaging. This is why people are told that \u201cif your pain persists for more than 10 days, consult your doctor.\u201d [This type of repart\u00e9e exists to protect your gastrointestinal mucosa.]\n\nSo, acetaminophen is a great overall pain drug because it doesn\u2019t affect your blood platelets; NSAIDS are also great because they can help you with inflammation after an injury; however, both should be used with caution and with no more than a doctor or pharmacist recommends. Also, if the person taking the drug is already damaged in their liver, kidneys, or experience frequent or prolonged stomach pain, they should consult their doctor or pharmacist before taking any of either drug set beyond the recommended dosage given on the product.\n\nFor more information please see:"}

They may be attributable to a common upper respiratory infection. Dr Jeremy Roland, Pulmonary Medicine in New York of Weill Cornell Medicine, is a pulmonary specialist. She\u2019s here to explain what a common upper respiratory infection is, how infection spreads, if it increases with age, and what the overall severity of the infection is.\n\n## What is a common upper respiratory infection?\n\nIt is a disease that involves the nose and throat, is caused by viruses, and affects people of all ages.\n\n## What causes the common cold?\n\nThe pathogens that cause it are viral and are spread through droplets when people sneeze. The droplets can also be spread by direct contact, such as shaking hands or holding hands. The virus is passed from human to human; we are constantly at risk of contracting the virus even if we have never had the common cold. Those who have experienced the common cold in the past usually have a higher susceptibility rate because they have developed immunity to some of the pathogens.\n\n## How do you know if you have it?\n\nIf you are unsure, we suggest that you talk to your doctor. While you may be asking yourself, \u201cWhat is a common upper respiratory infection?\u201d, the best way to diagnose if you have it is to describe the symptoms you are experiencing. In some cases, people with underlying diseases that affect their immune systems may experience complications from the virus such as pneumonia.\n\nIf you have a cough or a sore throat, that is usually indicative of a common cold. But just because the symptoms does not make your cough or sore throat occasional, your body may not have a reaction to the virus. However, based on our experience, people who have more than two symptoms are usually infected with a virus. Sickness, loss of appetite, and congestion or tears associated with a sore throat may also indicate an actual infection. These symptoms may resemble flu-like symptoms, but an upper respiratory infection likely remains in the throat and nose \u2013 not necessarily in the lungs."}

{"text": "Question: And how long should I wait before going to the hospital, if prednisone does not help with my symptoms? \n ### Answer: This was a question I had when I had my first ever Uric Acid attack.\n\nI tried to make a guess to determine if my pain symptoms are worse than a kidney stone attack (which was my baseline pain), so that I can arrive at the conclusion if it was high enough to warrant me going to the hospital room.\n\nI think the situation is unique to each person; especially if you have a kidney history as your \u2018baseline\u2019. So my recommendation would be that you go to the hospital immediately should your symptoms be keeping you from moving normally.\n\nIn case of prednisone, this is why I believe:\n\nPrednisone is good for severe attacks which require immediate pain relief. It is also ok to take it prophylactically prior to an attack. However, the long term use and side effects (if you look at reviews for prednisone) does not suggest that you should depend on it for the long run.\n\nIt is basically like a band-aid and in only relieves acute pain. It won\u2019t last long.\n\nTalk to your doctor about them and how what herbs or dietary measures you can implement to achieve better, longer lasting results for your pain relief."}

{"text": "Question: Is tessalon perles a symptom relief medication or curative? \n ### Answer: Tessalon Perles is a medication that is used to relieve pain and discomfort caused by coughing. It is a combination of two active ingredients, codeine and pholcodine, which work together to suppress coughing and provide relief from pain.\n\nCodeine is an opioid analgesic that works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, which reduces the perception of pain. Pholcodine is an antitussive that works by blocking the action of certain receptors in the brain that are responsible for triggering coughing.\n\nTessalon Perles is not a curative medication, but it can provide temporary relief from coughing and pain. It is important to note that Tessalon Perles should only be used for a short period of time, as prolonged use can lead to dependence and addiction.\n\nIt is also important to follow the dosage instructions provided by your healthcare provider and to avoid taking more than the recommended dose. If you experience any adverse effects while taking Tessalon Perles, such as drowsiness, dizziness, or constipation, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately.\n\nIn conclusion, Tessalon Perles is a medication that is used to relieve pain and discomfort caused by coughing.

And MM is a busy lady.\n\nHonestly I get this question every single day. For reference I am a fit and toned 5\u20191 woman who does a lot of workouts at home but has not achieved complete Arnold Schwarzenegger (insert insert chest flowing muscles name here) status. BUT \u2013 if powerlifting is what you choose, I\u2019ve done this quite a few times in my life and thought about steroids on numerous occasions. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t walk through hour strength training programs without using steroids but steroids do accelerate your workout results. I don\u2019t know how important it is that your muscles budge but if someone could possibly really spike a muscle budge hormone to cause a higher and more pronounced reaction, I would definitely be down. This is completely for physical benefit; as I mentioned before I\u2019m in fitness for performance and health and achievement, meaning I don\u2019t work out because I hate my body and want to fix it. I workout because I love to feel my muscles bounce and tone and grow and develop so that they better serve me as an athlete. Incidentally, I don\u2019t see this as part of my race or journey to get healthy primarily because my body will never be in better shape statistically than it is right now \u2013 and I don\u2019t Really care about the difference between now and a moments from now because really, at the end of the day it\u2019s me, happy and fit who does her thing, and if the goal is to reach a healthy state \u2013 the goal already has been met.\n\nSo the whole steroid thing is less about performance and health, and more about ego and narcissism if I\u2019m honest.\n\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t lift weights because women know they can\u2019t use anabolic steroids.\u201d\n\nOr at least that\u2019s what the memo says. But if we focus on looking better through a practice that could otherwise be quite harmful to our physical health, shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to help ourselves out just a bit with core strength and muscle health to hold our back together?\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about hormone drugs to talk about whether or not the negative effects are as horribly broad and harmful to our hormone status long-term.

I figured some tenderness (about 1 inch down right where the incision is) was only to be expected. The next day I didn't feel any and had to wonder if it was just it freaking me out. But yeah, take the ibuprofen. It reduces pain and inflammation.\n\nOf course, please ask your doctor as well. My guidance is not as of any medical consequence and is aimed primarily at calming you down that this is not uncommon.\n\nAlso, if that happens please please do not fuck around with frozen peas or anything. Something really cold applied to the area could build swelling considerably more. You are on the mend with the swelling in the first place. The cold would hurt the most at the skin level, not allowing a better flow of oxygen to the muscles and adjacent tissues.\n\nJust keep an eye on it. That being said, you can be at peace about any \u201csafety issues\u201d in relation to anesthesia as well. Here's a tip as well; please take some ibuprofen before the procedure.

Many individuals prefer drinking it because it contains antioxidants, which have been found to prevent cancer development. Some individuals who want to lose weight also prefer it because of its wonderful calming effects that suppress appetite.\n\n### Essential Elements Of A Good Tea\n\nBefore we talk about the different kind of teas for detoxification, it is important to know some of the essential elements that make a good herbal tea.\n\nKeep in mind the ingredients that you would like to use, particularly the infusion and water.

{"text": "Question: Is the ointment easier to apply? \n ### Answer: It is easier to apply ointment than it is a cream because there are no viscosity issues. Ointments are composed of glycerides (chiefly vegetable in origin) or mineral oil in the soft state. The proportion of water in the ointments is the same (about 10%), which means that they are not greasy. The anionic-cementing effects make the formulation less spreadable than a cream and also facilitates the formation of a protective barrier of the skin.\n\nIs the onset of the effect of ointment and creams the same?\n\nThe onset of the action was dependent on the area of application and the method of application. When applied on lesions typically visible to the naked eye, irresponsive to treatment, that occurred in places which were difficult to reach and eliminate, patients had smooth clear skin observed in two- to three-week time after the start of therapy.\n\nUsage Early application of ointment is highly recommended to avoid spreading of the infection.

The patient should be treated until recurrences no longer occur. Since the light-absorbing layer is suspended in a gas, the BabyCam becomes a light source, not a light detector. How often you have sex, and what type or temperament, leads to how often yeast disease can occur. For patients who do not respond to this initial therapy or who present with more severe abnormalities, immediate surgery is required to repair the condition. The potential for infectivity, and the selection of a microorganism as the causative agent, is determined by pH and nutritive inputs from bound water in the libido flood plains.

{"text": "Question: Should I keep using tucks? \n ### Answer: 2 tucks a day is a high dose for an IBS patient. Also, there are newer pads available than the tucks you are using so I would explore some of those like new Coloplast, Avon, and Waldman pads.\n\nMost people with IBS gel, talcum or baby powder type pads, but if relief continues for weeks past their span of normal span of using these pads then they switch immediately to a prepared like type like tucks pads. But those are not a permanent solution. So i am curious as to how long you have been using the tucks type pads and when you are having your flare.\n\nYou need to change your eating, personal hygiene, and stress control which most of us ignore. These three are the most responsible for decreasing IBS symptoms.\n\nIf flare persists, we then do quick palliative medicinal therapies that work in days.\n\nSource(s): decades of experience\n\nAnswer: There is no law that dictates you cannot use tucks for as long as you want or feel that you need to. Just make sure that you are moisturizing after using them. I hope you are using them for _external_ hemorrhoids, and not internal. I have some experience with external hemorrhoids, and one of the things that doctors tell me to do to help with them is to stay clean, using pads like tucks, wipes, etc. etc. My personal experience is that the rawness and itchiness decreases noticably when using those pads.This was an ano-rectal surgeon\u2019s advice to me, though, I have no first hand experience with internal hemorrhoids to know if that can result in results similar to what I describe. I really hope this is not the case for you, and I know internal hemorrhoids are the worst. Everyone with hemorrhoids is going to suffer immensely at some point, though.\n\nAnswer: Tucks are okay temporarily, but you really should look at other remedies. The regular hemorrhoid pads are generally okay. Tucks contain alcohol, witch hazel and menthol, which can overstimulate your sensitive tissue. Lidocaine isn\u2019t ideal because it masks the symptoms but it doesn\u2019t promote healing."}

There are two sterols and they are formed in the follicles of the eyelashes and within the mebarium glands where tears are produced. The two sterols are -1 secretin and -2 secretin. When someone is deficient in these two sterols, inflammation in the form of redness, scaliness, crusting, and sensitivity, forms.

If the pain is due to an insanely damaged region of the body, then the doctors will use the scar treatment and until the tissue is completely healed you will continue to suffer severe pain.\n\nThere are up-and-coming, less-invasive, pain suppression techniques, including a high concentration of THC transdermal patch that has been shown to significantly reduce some types of chronic pain.\n\nChronic pain is much harder to treat than acute pain because most chronic pain wears the patient down gradually. It becomes a pain tolerance, which weakens the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to heal itself. And this factor makes it much harder to eliminate.\n\nDongsheng Cai, M.D., PhD., and his extensive research team at the Center for Pain Relief Research at Portland State University is working on the \u2018why\u2019 of chronic pain.\n\nDongsheng Cai, M.D., PhD., and his extensive research team at the Center for Pain Relief Research at Portland State University is working on the \u2018why\u2019 of chronic pain.\n\nPain tolerance is a small part of the puzzle which his research is trying to remove. The other part is figuring out how to stop the pain at its source. Most pain is caused by inflammation or an inflammatory response. Even the massive scar wall that formed between my tissue offers a plethora of opportunity for the inflammatory process to brew and cause more pain later.\n\nSurgeries leave scar tissue. Scar tissue is a natural part of the body\u2019s healing process. Because of the damage that has been done to the tissue, the damage tissue will not begin to heal itself with the proper stratum corneum, the protective layer of living tissue that protects the healthy layer underneath. Without this shallow layer of living skin, scars can become a dramatic, pain-injecting machine.\n\nSo, the doctors, with the help of my amazing PT, introduced me to pressure changes in my bed, so that my pelvis won\u2019t stagnate. That pressure allows my pain generator to sleep more, let important right nerves to rest and avoid getting pulled. After surgery,"}

So it\u201ds easiest for you to call your health care professional. Your health care professional may write a prescription for 7 days of metronidazole, but if the BV returns, you may have to stay on it for 21 days next time. But calling is easier than making another appointment!\n\nYou will probably have more BV until the 3 days after you stop taking it. No antibiotics can cure HPV. Question What are the side effects of having bacterial vaginosis? For men, the formal name is trichomoniasis. Antibiotics may be prescribed to help clear BV, which might offer relief within a day or two and completely clear up the condition within a few weeks.

{"text": "Question: What would the Wellbutrin possibly addres ? \n ### Answer: One School of Thought is that Wellbutrin woukd be given along with an SSRI if the SSRI dosage does not suffice because it doesn't the patient felt better. In my case, I took Prozac 20 mg daily for almost two years, but my mood disorder was still persisting. Thus, as the season for me started this year, I reuyoured back to Prozac plus Wellbutrin since last 10 May 2007.\n\nAnother School of Thought is that if the experts decide that the patient didn't had persisting depression after 8 weeks on Wellbutrin, 12 more weeks must be done as continuation treatment. Reason is if Wellbutrin is stopping suddenly to be taken by the patient, it would trigger a relapse often said as \"rebound depression\". It's not true because it is still within the doctor's decision not to maintain the continuing treatment."}

It helps numb the throat and keeps it from getting hurt or sore when it\u2019s irritated. over-the-counter lidocaine for sore throat comes in various forms including mouth sprays, lozenges, syrups and gargles. Side effects may include headaches, muscle tension and dizziness, but if your doctor prescribes the medication, there are less common side effects.\n\n## What is Lidocaine?\n\nLidocaine, also known as \u201casparagus anesthetic,\u201d is an injectable local anaesthetic. It is a powerful anti-inflammatory and analgesic that is used to treat several types of gum and periodontal pain, as well as inflammation of your gums. It is used by dentists to numb the mouth and throat when they are treating gum disease. Lidocaine has a reputation for being incredibly safe over-the-counter, but if your doctor prescribed it for you, he will warn you that there are possible risks associated with it that are very serious. If taken in too high of a dosage overtime, you may be at risk for something called \u201conthosis capsular,\u201d. Read more about this side effect here.\n\n#### How Does Lidocaine Work?\n\nLidocaine works in two ways: to ease pain, but also to alleviate swelling and inflammation caused by gum disease. One of its first uses is during dental surgery. It is injected into your gums so you do not feel pain while the dentist works on your teeth. Lidocaine is also injected under the skin and into your body to numb certain areas after surgery, but in cases of severe toothaches or infections.\n\n#### Is Lidocaine Safe for Me?\n\nLIdocaine can be used safely on most people over a wide age range, but there are certain people who need to be careful about using this medication.

Still, many consider bed bugs to be a greater problem in the warmer months, however it is not the bed bugs that are more active in the summer months - the humans are. In warmer weather we typically travel more, often sleeping in hotels and motels, using various modes of transportation, and thereby increasing our risk of exposure to bed bugs. The bed bugs themselves are year-round pests.\n```\n\n> Bed bugs are active mainly at night. During the daytime, they prefer to hide close to where people sleep. Their flattened bodies enable them to fit into tiny crevices--especially those associated with mattresses, box springs, bed frames and headboards. Bed bugs do not have nests like ants or bees, but do tend to congregate in habitual hiding places. Characteristically, these areas are marked by dark spotting and staining, which is the dried excrement of the bugs. Also present will be hatched and un-hatched eggs, the tannish shed skins of maturing nymphs, and the bugs themselves.

{"text": "Question: Do I need to put drops in both eyes or just the one that is bothering me? \n ### Answer: Many patients will only have symptoms in one eye that is usually redder than the other eye. It is very important to use the drops in both eyes. Why you may ask?  Your eye drops contain local and systemic medications that are effective in both eyes.  The local medications help to relieve the surface inflammation and suppress the initiation of the disease process.  The systemic medications help to control systemic symptoms like itching in both eyes.\n\nWill I have to use drops every day?\n\nIf you have allergic eye disease, it can be very debilitating and potentially cause severe eye damage.  Therefore it is important to use the drops as instructed by your eye doctor.  People with mild cases can use drops only seasonally and some individuals require long term therapy in order to control the disease.\n\nWhat are the side effects of eye drops?\n\nThe most common side effect is burning.  If you experience significant burning, it is recommended that you consult your eye doctor."}

{"text": "Question: Do I not qualify for Paxlovid? \n ### Answer: There is only one requirement to qualify for Paxlovid, which is that you are 65 years or older and have mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms, or you are younger than 65 years of age and are considered to be at high risk for severe COVID-19. The high-risk population comprises people with conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, some amount of obesity, history of heart disease or prior stroke. So if you have any of these factors or any of these high risk factors...And you've got it, you qualify for Paxlovid. You just just give a call to your doctor. If it is even remotely possible. You might not qualify for Paxlovid. And that depends on your symptoms and your situation and your prior history and your risk factors.\n\nThere's quite a few different scenario under which you would not be eligible for Paxlovid. The Paxlovid is only used for the patients with mild to moderate disease without severe hypoxiam which has clinical progression that led to need for some acute care for the hospitalization or death within 30 days. So the patient with relatively subtle symptoms, as long as we---they don't qualify for oxygen, they are still eligible for Paxlovid, even though they have more baseline symptoms. And then lastly, you need to be in its earlier in the infection. So the earlier you are more eligible for Paxlovid. But obviously where you have any of those other one of those factors, you can still qualify Paxlovid, but just not as early on in the infection.\n\nMy doctor says I am not eligible for Paxlovid, but I understand it was used in a high infection rates area.\n\nSo I feel like I should be eligible to take it like in New York, where they had a very high infection rate. The patients had an increased risk for becoming severely ill. And here, even though I'm not eligible.\n\nThe reason they've created a different set of rules for those patients in New York and some of those other areas last year is because the environments at that time were a little bit different. We understood the risk of Omicron back then. So I think that the rules are trying to use wisely and efficiently. So there's 16 million high-risk patients in the U.S. today, 1"}

I am disturbed by the growing trend of prescribing the sleep medicine trazodone \u2018off label\u2019 to treat anxiety. I\u2019ve seen online recs for doing this among naturopaths and also among M.D.s\n\n## What is Trazodone?\n\nTrazodone (Desyrel) is a serotonin uptake inhibitor that\u2019s commonly used to treat depression, anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness in many people (especially those at the end of life.)\n\nThe medication is FDA-approved for treating depression in both adolescents and adults (though, the dosing recommendations vary from those for adults.)\n\nWhile most of the research done on the drug has involved outcomes related to depression, a significant indicator (over 600,000+pagereads) of people seeking information on this drug online is \u201clow libido\u201d.\n\nA 2016 study published in The Patient found that 7 out of 10 young people (under 34years of age) suspected that trazodone was causing their low sexual drive. Trazodone is a \u201cPEJ\u201d (prescribed everyday junk): medication people \u201ckeep on taking\u201d for chronic or symptomatic (versus \u201cessential\u201d) reasons even though they don\u2019t believe the medication is making them feel any better. Many do this because stopping the medication often results in withdrawal symptoms; these symptoms replicate the original doctor-defined indications for PEJ (eg, pain, sleep problems, anxiety, etc).\n\nWhile many people probably aren\u2019t aware of it, trazodone can also increase the risk of life-threatening bleeding when combined with other drugs. It can also prolong a QT interval in the heart and this can be life-threatening, especially for older people. It\u2019s reported that doctors are now prescribing more antidepressant medications like trazodone for other conditions like pain and anxiety (because it\u2019s cheaper to do this.)\n\nThis drug does not help with all cases of insomnia and lack of sleep.

{"text": "Question: Why would all of us have a stomach bug again? \n ### Answer: There are many different kinds of stomach disease, including food poisoning, gastritis, stomach cancer, Hiatal hernia, intestinal parasites, and ulcers. Symptoms are vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and B Loops. An enzyme called pepsin, produced in our stomachs, digests proteins when ingested, and another enzyme known as pancreatic lipase, is found in the pancreas aids in breaking down fat. These two enzymes require a highly acidic environment. Most oils and fats are therefore quite acidic, falling within a pH range between 4 and 6. Another factor involved in lipase's ability to digest fat is its reduced ability to digest fat that is in solid form, such as that found in cooked animal protein like beef and fish. As our bodies get older, their ability to produce more acid in the stomach decreases, meaning that many people in their mid-twenties and beyond may not have the needed amounts of stomach acid for efficient digestion, leading to the conditions outlined above.\n\n## Weak Stomach Acid - Stomach Suppression\n\nWhen stomach acid is suppressed, proteins are not digested well, and if the food particles are not large enough to pass through the intestines and out to the colon quickly, they putrefy in the stomach, producing some bad by-products. Bad signs may consist of colic, lack of appetite, aching in the abdominal area, constipation, pimples, a predisposition to illness, and a host of other symptoms.

{"text": "Question: Would high heart rate be caused by being overweight at all? \n ### Answer: Is a low heart rate good for overweight people? Being overweight is a huge problem in the USA. Is heart rate a good indicator of being over or under-weight? What do studies show in this regard?\n\n## Is There A Link Between Low/High Heart Rate and being overweight?\n\nSome studies have shown that there actually could be a connection between your heart rate and your body weight. From the research done in this regard, a link between low or higher heart rate and the individual\u2019s body weight was established. However, most of the obese people actually had a higher heart rate and the emaciated people had a lower heart rate. This is kind of strange but that is what a lot of researchers have documented. But, the truth is that not all overweight people have a high heart rate. There actually is a direct relationship between heart rate and body weight.\n\nIt has also turned out that shorter adults have a slightly lower average resting heart rate relative to their body weight. This seems to show that people who are shorter than average have lower heart rates than their taller counterparts. If you still wonder if your heart is too low or too high, read on to see how you can do body composition tests to determine the measurement.\n\n## Body Composition for Accurate Heart Rate Measurement\n\nThis may sound old school to you but it actually works. To measure your body\u2019s composition accurately, it\u2019s advisable to measure the beats per minute of your heart while taking a rest. You may get better results if you\u2019ll subsequently compare these measurements with other similar measurements determined for other people. If you have a heart rate like 85 beats per minute and 0.3mm/kg lower than the average values, then you are underweight. On the other hand, if your heart rate is 85 and you have 0.44mm/kg higher, then you are overweight. Low heart rate is simply caused by weight gain while high heart rates are caused by weight loss or undernourishment. It is this heart rate that can determine one\u2019s fat to muscle rate.\n\nYou should also find out if your low or high heart rate reading is among a group that are within the average resting pulse rate. As already stated above, the range of normal rates is 60 to 100 beats per minute if a person is at rest. If your heart rate is below 60 is"}

I had a few for this week actually and am adding a category for them.) I figured that there was still some controversy with this, and that people would not agree with me. And so I decided to ask you. \ud83d\ude42\n\nYou can eat commercially available yogurt, fermented foods like long pickles and sauerkraut, kefir, kombucha made at home from a higher quality SCOBY, and other cultured foods.\n\nYou can find some probiotics (usually highly concentrated to higher doses than you would need or find in other sources) that deliver one or just a few strains, which may or may not work well for you.\n\nYou can spend your money to experiment on what may or may not work for your body. Better yet, you can try yogurt, kefir and fermented food recipes with some spaghetti sauce or queso fresco (which you aren\u2019t going to find out on your own).\n\nThe longer I live, the more I realize how each ingredient, food, and spice has a purpose. Thankfully, as the original Europeans traveled the globe, they brought their native foods with them including the recipes which later we use to improve our recipes. In today\u2019s day and age, we still experiment with multiple variants of many traditional foods and cuisine, but we may not also realize and appreciate the content of each ingredient in our food.\n\nYou can make and ferment your own kefir or create your own probiotics and Kombucha from a SCOBY. Kombucha is an unfiltered, unpasteurized cultured beverage that contains slightly less alcohol than beer.\n\nTo ferment \u201cvegetables,\u201d you will need a rinse of brine, which is about 4.5% concentration of salt, of which you will have about 2 tablespoons in the jar.

It only becomes an issue when it causes ulcers or other conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease, or when we try to test for it on false premises - as in trying to treat it with a false positive as the cause (much like if you had rash all over your skin and took a pill for egg allergy dosen't make sense - a rash can have many causes, you have to address the actual cause to find relief).\n\nAlso, just because you get a negative test for H.Pylori does not mean that all your GI issues are caused by stress and diet - there are many other less common, lesser reported and more complex causes (IBD, chronic inflammation, food intolerances and more) of GI issues than caused by eating too many cookies. Often times, the more complicated the cause the more a diagnosis of IBS is given than the actual medical condition.\n\nOften times, the more complicated the cause the more a diagnosis of IBS is given than the actual medical conditions.\n\nLOL, forgot to mention, as far as H.Pylori goes, any kind of medical practitioner that doesn't look at all cases via multi-disciplinary approach (Western medicine combined with Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Naturopathic medicine, anti-oxidant diet, gut health, etc.) should be avoided at all costs"}

{"text": "Question: What is the criteria for antibiotics? \n ### Answer: When do you treat antibiotics? Does taking an antibiotic means you have an infection?\n\nAntibiotic(s) are drugs designed to kill bacterial cells or stop them from growing. Antibiotics will usually be helpful for bacterial infections. Antibiotic treatments should be used appropriately and thoughtfully based on clinical assessment and diagnostic testing. Overuse of Antibiotics (abuse), is common and may lead to resistant bacteria which are more likely to cause infections that are difficult to treat.\n\nAntibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria evolve a mechanism to prevent the antibiotic from killing them or to help them grow in the presence of the antibiotic (antibiotic resistance). When Infection is due to viruses, Antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Certain antibiotic use inhibits evolution to drug resistance.\n\nA Doctor can determine what antibiotics are most likely to be effective against what organisms are causing or likely causing infection. Antibiotic resistance patterns are first determined by a laboratory analyzing samples of bacteria from the patient (Clinical/Diagnostic Testing). Antibiotic resistance is used to select the most perfect antibiotics to treat the infection with the bacteria with by default wrong choice of antibiotics can be a reason of Increase disease and condition.\n\nAntibiotic resistance develops in bacteria, it is a natural process that happens over time. Laboratory, An elevated likelihood of antibiotic resistance does not imply the antibiotics will be ineffective as treatment of bacterial infections. Resistant bacteria may cause an infection that is more difficult to treat and may require more treatment then non resistant bacteria.\n\nIt is impossible to order a Test of antibiotic sensitivity while a patient is receiving intravenous antibiotics. A number of things can interfere with test for antibiotic sensitivity. It is the opportunity to perform prediction testing will be used as a guide for the use of a course of future Antibiotic\n\nNot everyone needs to get antibiotics for certain infections. Firs they have to find out which bacteria is causing the infection. It is imperative the doctors get the first antibiotic right on the first try so that they can help their patients recover. If you start unnecessary antibiotics, you risk the bacteria becoming resistant to treatment in the future.\n\nAntibiot"}

{"text": "Question: I usually take Nascort instead of Flonasane, any differnece? \n ### Answer: It also depends on what you need it for, some people prone to rhinitis or allergies, need a longer acting decongestant and will use Flonase or Nascort daily. Some folks only use an antihistamine when a allergy attack occurs or if there are sinus symptoms go buy Benadryl, Tylenol or Aleve. Flonase and Nascort are \"nasal steroids\".If you're a seasonal allergy sufferer, the once-daily steroid nasal sprays, like Nasacort and Flonase, are your best bet for longer term relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever. They work well for what ails you, but they have to be taken on a consistently-daily basis to maintain their effectiveness. All of the nasal sprays are safe to self-administer at home as long as you clear them with your doctor first.\n\nAlso, Nascort can alter your sleeping pattern,which is something to consider because too little sleep can have adverse effects, and it can cause high blood pressure.\n\nLast edited:\n\nI started with Nasacort about a month ago. Although it indeed does sting, it settles down quickly. I use it every 4 to 5 days, and have seen a great improvement in my stuffy nose and post nasal drip.

{"text": "Question: what is the usual treatment for hives? \n ### Answer: Hives are a common skin condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies, infections, and certain medications. While hives can be uncomfortable and unsightly, they are usually not a serious medical condition and can often be treated at home.\n\nThe first step in treating hives is to identify and avoid the trigger that is causing the reaction. This may involve avoiding certain foods, medications, or other substances that have been known to cause hives in the past. If the trigger is unknown, it may be necessary to keep a diary of symptoms and potential triggers to help identify the cause.\n\nIn addition to avoiding triggers, there are several home remedies that can help relieve the symptoms of hives. These include:\n\n- Applying a cold compress to the affected area to help reduce itching and swelling.\n- Taking an over-the-counter antihistamine to help reduce the body\u2019s histamine response, which can cause hives.\n- Applying a topical cream or ointment that contains hydrocortisone, which can help reduce inflammation and itching.\n- Taking a warm bath with colloidal oatmeal, which can help soothe the skin and reduce itching.\n\nIf home remedies are not effective in relieving the symptoms of hives, it may be necessary to seek medical treatment. A doctor may prescribe a stronger antihistamine or a corticosteroid cream to help reduce inflammation and itching. In some cases, a doctor may also recommend a course of oral steroids to help control severe hives.\n\nIt is important to note that hives can sometimes be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition, such as an allergic reaction or an autoimmune disorder. If hives are accompanied by other symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swelling of the face or throat, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nIn conclusion, hives are a common skin condition that can often be treated at home with over-the-counter medications and home remedies. However, if home remedies are not effective or if hives are accompanied by other symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention to rule out any underlying conditions and to receive appropriate treatment."}

I have never had any problems.\n\n## Is it safe to use filtered water for a nasal wash?\n\nIt is safe to use filtered water for a nasal wash.\n\n## What are the benefits of using filtered water for a nasal wash?\n\nThere are many benefits to using filtered water for a nasal wash. Filtered water is free of impurities and contaminants that can cause irritation and inflammation in the nasal passages. Filtered water is also free of chlorine and other chemicals that can be harmful to the nasal passages. Filtered water is also free of bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause infection.\n\n## How do I know if my filtered water is safe for a nasal wash?\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific type of filter used and the quality of the water being filtered. However, in general, most filters will remove harmful bacteria and other contaminants from water, making it safe for a nasal wash.\n\n## What are the risks of using unfiltered water for a nasal wash?\n\nThere are a few risks associated with using unfiltered water for a nasal wash. First, unfiltered water may contain bacteria or other contaminants that can cause infection. Second, unfiltered water may contain minerals or other substances that can irritate the nasal passages. Finally, unfiltered water may not be as effective at removing mucus and other debris from the nasal passages as filtered water.\n\n## How do I choose the right filter for my nasal wash?\n\nThere are a few things to consider when choosing a filter for your nasal wash. The first is the type of filter. There are two main types of filters: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical filters use a physical barrier to remove particles from the water, while chemical filters use a chemical reaction to remove particles. The second thing to consider is the size of the filter. The filter should be small enough to fit in your nose, but large enough to remove particles from the water. The third thing to consider is the price. Filters can range in price from a few dollars to over $100.\n\n## How often should I change"}
{"text": "Question: What about for itch and pain? \n ### Answer: (the cause and the result)\n\nHow does our body communicate?\n\nDoes it speak a written language, the verbal language or the body language?\n\nLike a computer, every single organ, bone, muscle and tissue in our body produces its own information, and a sequence of it, and then transmits that information into a certain receptor where different \u201ccomputational\u201d elements are decoded and transmitted from there in a final code into our central nervous system, by a set of two languages: sensation and movement.\n\nThe skin is the body\u2019s first line of defense. Physically, it shields the body from disease-causing microorganisms and injury. More importantly, from top to bottom, skin is a sensory organ that communicates temperature, texture, and pressure. By decoding sensation into movement, initially, the brain perceives the external environment, then decides what it will do in response to it, and then commands the body\u2019s nervous system and other systems to carry out the movement.\nSignals from the central nervous system are delivered by neurons of the ventral root, which connect to the spinal cord and ultimately the brain. There are two broad types of neurons: mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors sense physical features (weight, pressure, temperature, texture, hardness, etc) while thermoreceptors respond to hot and cold in a wide range.\n\nWhat are the signs of the onset of itching and pain?\n\nThe moment of this onset is an instant of failure either in one of the body\u2019s sensory organs (receptor, nerve, brain) or in the communication between any two of them.\n\nLet\u2019s take one of the most common skin diseases: an itchy/painful rash. Many of us still misunderstand the cause of these symptoms rather than the result, by thinking of them as the disease in itself. The rash is only the manifestation of this interference in the form of the skin peeling; what lies under the skin, is a miscommunication between receptor and central nervous system, which has gone out of synchrony, causing itchiness. The brain does not know either what kind of sensation or movement it needs to carry out. It questions the environment. It needs to pinpoint the stimulation source. But how? By trying to articulate it with all its forms of movement. If"}

{"text": "Question: Can ghonorrea cause issues with the kidneys? \n ### Answer: Answer\n\nGhonorrea infections do not typically go to the kidneys. This is a condition where over time, the infection eats its way out of the prostate, or seminal vesicles, where it normally lodged and ended up in the urine or blood. Since it comes up through the prostate duct and out into the urethra, it often gets lodged in the bladder, causing bleeding when you urinate. Gonorrhea travels in all kinds of bodily secretions and can end up in other tissues, such as on the cervix, in swabs for HPV or Pap testing, or going up into the endometrium. If it causes abscesses or infected ulcers, then these may contribute to leaking of inflammatory material, and a genital-based infection can follow this into the bloodstream. If there is a heart condition, such as a weak valve or congenital hole, then the infection can penetrate directly into the bloodstream. No, gonorrhea does not go to the kidneys but it can cause systemic conditions that result in urinary tract infections and bacteremia, which can attach at both urinary and bladder sites. However, it is possible that the infection was not treated enough or early enough for this to happen. If you have been treated and are still having abdominal pains, you should call and let your doctor know about this. Though others thought there was no way this could have happened, your question is legit, and it is not unknown as a problem to the doctors and nurses who educate us on sexually transmitted infections. If you have kidney trouble, see your doctor. - Tonia Villarin Here's what I found on the internet: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethritis#Urethritis_in_Men http://www.casesjournals.us/v4s1/s1-8.pdf As you know, there are different types of gonorrhea: anal, mouth, throat, and many more.

{"text": "Question: Do you think this is meningitis? \n ### Answer: First just to add to your information I have a swab reading I am growing Candida in my throat, that could be the root of my whole problem!\n\nMy symptoms include muscle tension at the back of my neck when I wake up, causing a migraine, if I bother to use heat and massage I can walk off this but when it happens when I ovulate it becomes a horrendous migraine.  I also get spasms down that are caused by the vagus nerve but caused by the constant migraines.  I have also been constipated for a year which is really quite torturous, I am trying everything.  Following eating correctly I get bouts of diarrhoea for two days after.  I have lost almost 15 kgs this year so I assume it must be connected to stress.  I can get bloating if I eat a lot of cheese so I don\u2019t know what part that plays.

I am loathe to push this further otherwise I will get accused of being a hypochondriac.  I emailed the clinic because my dates were correct for testing but they were still insisting that I wasn\u2019t ovulating and that the pain was my ending my period which made no sense at all. My periods used to be fine, I was very regular.  I was under stress when I started getting these symptoms, that may well be a factor. They have offered me a blood test for Thyroid??? Of all things, that doesn\u2019t make any sense either!

Other retinoids are Tretinoin (available in a cream or gel form) Zinamet (a lower strength Vitamin A pills) or Acitretin (another oral retinoid). Both tretinoin and acitretin can be prescribed by your dermatologist or medical doctor. Retinoids are VERY drying o your skin. This means that retinoids cause skin to be more sensitive to irritation and can dry out your skin even more (if that\u2019s possible!). Severe sun sensitivity (sun burn) can result. Therefore it is important to moisturize often and use sunscreen regularly at high sun exposure."}

{"text": "Question: Thank you, is it okay for me to take probiotics while breastfeeding? \n ### Answer: Well, here is to admit that new mothers can easily become overwhelmed with the tasks they have to perform each day. They are expected to drive themselves to postpartum appointments, dealing with the high hormonal changes while caring for a new-born baby.\n\nTherefore, lots of mothers can forget to look after themselves, preventing them from making enough time for self-care.\n\nFortunately, taking probiotics provides an easy path for new mums to take care of themselves. However, can you take probiotics when breastfeeding? Keep reading this post to get more details!\n\n## What are probiotics?\n\nSimply called good bacteria, probiotics can be found in supplements and foods. They work to help conserve healthy bacteria in the body, thus populating beneficial bacterial varieties in your gut 3 times more than your current gut.\n\n## Why newborn mums should take probiotics\n\nThere is no doubt that breastfeeding is the best nutritional choice for new-born babies. However, new-born babies with an immature immune system are more susceptibility to infection or diseases than adults.\n\nMore so, using medications to combat illness can expose breastfeeding babies to adverse effects. Hence, taking probiotics and other supplements is a good idea.\n\nFurthermore, it plays the role of supplying babies with lots of nutritional elements like vitamin B12, folate, vitamin K, protein, and zinc that are deficient in human breast milk.\n\nEvidence from recent research documents that new-born babies whose mothers take probiotics while breastfeeding experience fewer infections with reduced cold symptoms and over 80% of new-born babies have a lesser risk of getting diarrhea, compared with new-born babies whose mothers are not taking probiotics.\n\n## Research about probiotics when breastfeeding\n\nMothers taking probiotics can benefit both new-born babies and their mothers, especially since they are infants with an immature immune system. Below are positive effects of probiotics when breastfeeding:\n\n- Preventing ear infections, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach aches in the babies\n- Protecting the mothers from gum disease, reduced gastrointestinal problems, urinary tract infections\n- Prevent"}

{"text": "Question: and what time of day is best for taking Lexapro? \n ### Answer: Let\u2019s find out.\n\n# Time of Day & Lexapro\n\n#### Consistency is Key\n\nWant to get the most out of your medication? Then it\u2019s very important that you take it at the same time each day. This rule applies not just to Lexapro, but to any other medication as well.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re taking Lexapro every day at the same time, it will begin to achieve steady levels of concentration in your bloodstream.\n\nIf your dosage is going to be changed, it\u2019s very important that you inform your doctor about any issues related to the time of day on which you take your medicine.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to adjust when you take it (in accordance with how it\u2019s better for your current dosage), not only to ensure that Lexapro reaches steady blood levels but also so that you can avoid any dose-related side effects.\n\nFor instance, Lexapro, particularly in its 10mg form, is associated with drowsiness and some loss of heart rate. If you were to take it before going to bed, you may not get as good a night\u2019s sleep as you would have with a different medication but if you take Lexapro right after waking up, then you risk having the outcome affected.\n\n#### Side Effects and Syndrome Warnings\n\nOne of the conditions that\u2019s frequently mentioned in Lexapro literature is rather worryingly known as withdrawal syndrome.\n\nThis temporary condition is most frequently associated with changes in dosage, especially when you\u2019re reducing your medication.\n\nIt classically affects children and teenagers (with most cases occurring among those aged 9, 10, 11 or 12) who are either tapering off Lexapro or who are coming off Lexapro entirely.\n\nAs the drug tapers off in their body or is no longer there at all, the children may become rather agitated and experience insomnia and dizziness. Thankfully, these side-effects typically subside in one to two weeks and are frequently no longer an issue by the time the subsequent week begins. They really aren\u2019t as bad as they sound at first but you will definitely want to avoid putting your child through this.\n\nConsider this: to minimize the likelihood that your child will experience withdrawal syndrome, you can try telling them about withdrawal syndrome well in"}

{"text": "Question: What would show a disk issue vs a steain? \n ### Answer: Severe vibration is a symptom of a worst case scenario. Before anything else, you should look for damaged rack bolts where the shocks or upper spindles mount to the truck. Securing these properly is so important, you may have voided warranty from poor treatment of your truck in the past. Also, inspect the non drive side trailer tire for excessive cracking or separation.\nCautiously inspect the steering linkage for weakness. I would not initially do a major steering overhaul but just make sure all the links and other components are still in proper working order and tighten or replace if necessary. Loosen the pitman arm and remove the spindle plate with the rubber gasket, replacement pieces in your Hawk trailer as was recommended. Slightly old cracked plates are going to be very common on many trailers."}

{"text": "Question: Is there anything I can put inside my nose to help the pain? \n ### Answer: There are several medications available in small bottles made specifically for the nose and sinuses. These medications are either thumbed up or pumped into the sinuses and can provide relief. Some believe that putting certain saline solutions inside the nose can prevent bleeding or complications after sinus surgery.\n\nThe normal sinuses are close to or in contact with the eye and ears. Anything that is put inside the nose can flow down throughout the sinuses as far as the back of the head. If the materials flow past the nose, they can reach the eye or ear.\n\nExamples of what can happen to your eye or ear by putting items inside your nose are:\n\nEYE: Eye irritation, itching, pain and redness\n\nEAR: Ear irritation, itching, pain and redness\n\nWHAT SHOULD I DO?\n\nIf the eye or ear is irritated, itching, painful or red it is best to see your doctor. If you have taken the nose medication within the last 30 minutes, put a cool compress on the eye or ear. Use a small washcloth put together with the eyes tightly shut and place it gently overlapping the eye or ear. This will help reduce any irritation that you might feel. If left untreated the irritation can get worse. After 30 minutes of the cooling, a visit to your doctor should be made.\n\nWHAT CAN BE DONE?\n\nDepending on the condition of the eye, your doctor may need to treat the eye with eyedrops. In some cases all that is needed is a lubricating eye ointment (a thick grease like material) to reduce the irritation. In extreme cases in which the eye is severely inflamed, antibiotic drops and ointment may be necessary. If the eye is red it is a good idea to keep a soft cool compress (as described above) over the eye until such time that you can see your doctor. They may use other methods to reduce redness and irritation.\n\nIf your ear is affected, it depends on how severe the reaction from the medication. In some cases, all that might be needed is to make an appointment with the doctor, this may be all that is needed. Your doctor may recommend a special saline solution for the ear to help the irritation. Your doctor may recommend making an appointment to flush your ears to remove the irritating materials."}

In our approach to treating tinnitus, the first priority is to reduce the baseline ringing level. This is accomplished by prescribing the latest tinnitus masker while determining if hearing loss is present and, if so, fit patients with hearing aids.\n\nContinuing with the treatment of tinnitus, we need to determine if anything is causing a hyperactivity of the ear. For example, if the underlying hyperactivity is otitis centered, vertigo would be expected. We treat these symptoms with otitis medication injected in the ear canal and the use of an otitis to allay the restrictive feeling in the ear. In addition to the otitis treatment, we may apply vestibular rehabilitation.\n\nA little wrinkle and a bit of background about vertigo; if a patient has these symptoms, it is worth exploring any reason in a non-ear part of the body. For example, patients with idiopathic hyperacusis have reported loss of balance following resection of a benign tumor called a litonot messenger without an identified communication with the vestibular system. It would seem, however, that a patient who suffered congestion from an infection in an unrelated region, such as the sinuses, has transferred symptoms to the ears. In your case, you may have first noticed the vertigo and otitis congestion symptoms.\n\nPadma\nDr. Gopal Padmanabhan"}

In fact, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we\u2019re talking about classic depression \u2013 major depression \u2013 but rather that we\u2019re talking about a milder form of depression, that could simply be the fact that, for example, one could have a tendency to overeating at some periods in life that we know that are connected to periods of stress and which bring a lot of anxiety.\n\nThis is a particular situation where I would want to distinguish the overeating that makes appear because one of the symptoms associated with depression, and the overeating which, for example, has to do with another psychological problem, would appear explanation, because perhaps a nutritional problem that if left treated would lead to depression.

{"text": "Question: How many mg of melatonin do you recommend? \n ### Answer: We have done our research on this, and we believe the correct dose for any melatonin supplement is between 1 and 10 mg. We recommend starting out with a dose of approximately 1 mg, since daily doses greater than 3 mg very often cause headaches and other undesirable adverse effects. Because our melatonin supplement is available in the form of gummies, however, you will need to take a somewhat larger dose, since the melatonin is gradually absorbed into the body by the stomach and there is a higher risk of having too little melatonin in the body. This is especially the case if you need to ensure the right dose of melatonin is available in the body around night-time, before you go to bed."}

Would I be taking Buspar along with the Zoloft everyday?\n\nVerbalize\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nZoloft is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) while Buspar is a [base]amino acid derivative antidepressant. There are multiple combinations of medications that have been proven to work well together so yours should not be any different.  You will likely see better results with the addition of Buspar, but you\u2019ll need time for your body to adjust to the added medication, so give it at least 3 weeks before you judge if something isn\u2019t working or not.\n\nI\u2019ve told my psychiatrist that you answer questions.\n\nDayo\nPsychology\nI love being a psych nurse.

{"text": "Question: I'm allergic to ampicillin is the augmentin still ok? \n ### Answer: Yes, it is safe to use. There are, however, a number of precautions to be taken. If you have recently used any other penicillin based product, you may be allergic to the penicillin as well. If you are allergic to penicillin, you should not use augmentin because it also contains penicillin.
