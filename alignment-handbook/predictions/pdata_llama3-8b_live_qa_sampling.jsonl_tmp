{"Question": "What is the relationship between Noonan syndrome and polycystic renal disease?", "Free_form_answer": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and Bonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a shield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of rotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.

Noonon syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the body and face. It is caused by a mutation in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes a protein called SHP-2. SHIP-1 is involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in this gene can lead to Noonons syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, webbed neck, low-set ears, ptosis, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, downslanting palpebral fissures, high-arched palate, micrognathia, clinodactyly, hypotonia, mental retardation, cardiac defects, cryptorchidism in males, renal anomalies, hearing loss, sensorineural deafness, cataracts, strabismus, myopia, retinal detachment, glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, optic atrophy, nystagmus, corneal opacity, keratoconus, blepharitis, conjunctivitis. The most common cause of death in Noonns syndrome patients is heart disease. Other causes of mortality include respiratory failure, sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism. Noonn syndrome can be diagnosed by genetic testing. Treatment for Noonnon syndrome includes surgery to correct heart defects and other medical problems. There is no cure for this condition.", "I have a cousin who is deaf and has an enlarged cerebellum. His nephew has the polychystis renal.

The 23 pairs of chromosomes are called autosomes and are numbered 1 through 22. An exception is two of the 24 pairs are very different \u2013 called the sex chromosomes with females having two X chromosomes and males having an X and a Y chromosome. Most cells in your eyes, hair, and skin, for example, are diploid cells, so each cell has a pair of each chromosome, 44 autosomal chromosomes plus two sex (X) chromosomes. For ease we are talking male, therefore males will also have one Y sex chromosome.\nNoonan Syndrome is caused by several autosomally inherited mutations. Polycysts are inherited in autosomic dominant fashion.\nThe answer to the cause for the family disorder is very interesting. Since two autosomses both could be either inherited from same mother, thus, if the deaf cousin inherited a poly cystic gene from this parent, it would not have been discovered. However, the male has inherited the Noon syndrome gene and the poly renal has been inherited because of a rare coupling (gene mutations) between the X chromosome and inherited autosome inherited gene mutations.\nI would have to refer to geneticist for such a case.

Children with the syndrome also have", "Noonan Syndrome is a genetic multi-system disorder that occurs in 1 per 1000-2500 live births and manifests as congenital heart defects, short stature, dysplastic pulmonary valves, and short fourth metacarpals. Patients often suffer from developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial anomalies, cryptorchidism and lymphedema. There is no family transmission or parent-child transmission of Noonans syndrome, but there is recurrence in the offspring of patients. Noon\u00e1n syndrome is caused by mutations in several genes, most of which encode non-receptor tyrosine kinases. It is more common in patients with heterozygous PTPN11 (90 percent of cases) or in those with KRAS/KRAS exon 9 (7 percent). People suffering from Noonain syndrome are at an increased risk of cancer, renal cancer being one of many. However, only 4 cases of polyclinic kidney disease patients developing Noonian syndrome have been discovered in literature. The most common genetic cause of PKD is an autosomal dominant mutation in PKHD1, which encodes fibrocystein. If one parent has PKDK, each child has a 50 percent chance of having the condition. PKR is mostly harmless with symptoms starting between 25-40 years old with the majority of individuals reaching more than 60 years.

It\u2019s the first 4-10 weeks after contracting syphillus (about 3-6 months from exposure), when the infection is highly infectious, but has not yet become localized (stage I) that the patient is treated with 500,000 units of penicillin intramuscularly for 5 days. After this initial treatment, the course of the illness is variable, ranging from a simple asymptomatic infection during which the body gradually develops a tolerance to the presence of bacteria (after several months) to rapid progression to severe (and possibly lethal) illness, with no visible signs of infection. The duration of this stage varies from 1 to 7 years.\nAs you don\u2019t mention any symptoms, so that your positive is in the early stage, this is a time that is crucial in determining the future course and outcome of an illness.

What is the concentration of the drug in the vials of insulin? These are all questions that are important to know when you are using a drug. The concentration is a measure of how much of a substance is present in one unit of volume. It is usually expressed in milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) or micrograms per microliter (\\(\\mu\\)g/\\(\\upmu\\)).\nThe concentration can be calculated by dividing the total amount of drug by the volume of solution. For example, if you have a 10 mL vail of 100 units/mL insulin, the insulin concentration would be 1,000 units per 0.1 mL. This means that there are 50 units of glucose in each milligram of this insulin.\nThe amount that is injected is also important. If you inject 2 units, then the amount in your body will be twice as much as if it were 4 units. So, it is important that you know how many units are in 5 mL of your insulin. You can find this information on the label of each viali.\nIf you need to calculate the number of units in an insulin vialis, you can use the following formula: (number of milliliters) x (concentration of unit) = (total number) of (units).

Glucose is a vital component of your body, so it is important to understand how to use it correctly. First, make sure to read the instructions before using your GlukaGen.\nWhen you're out and about, most people don't have their glucagene handy. It's an essential life-saving medication, but you need to buy it ahead of time -- and keep it handy so your doctor can prescribe it if needed. Many glucagen suppliers require customers to purchase a glucose meter before they're eligible for the product. Even if you can't get your hands on them, many glucose monitoring solutions include a glucomate meter, which is designed to calculate the amount of glucose needed during an allergic reaction.\nWhat is Glurcogin?\nGlucaGin contains three different ingredients. These three ingredients, in combination with other essential nutrients, help in maintaining the ideal level of blood glucose. The reason why Gluecogen contains these three essential substances is that they help prevent and treat chronic cases of type 2 diabetes. In addition, these substances also help lower blood pressure and cholesterol.\nThere are two kinds of these pills that you should be aware of. One is glucosinolates which help with liver function and blood sugar control. Another type is allicin. Allicins are believed to be anti-inflammatory and have a powerful effect on the body. If you are taking Glucegen, you will be surprised at the number of advantages that it offers you. With the help of GluucoGine, your blood vessels can become healthier and you may also experience a reduction in high blood cholesterol levels.\nGlucosamine: Glutamine is one of the most important components of Glicogen. Its amino acid properties help maintain the proper level in your system. While GlucoGen does not have any other ingredients that can cause any problems, there are certain precautions that need takered when taking the pill.\nIf you have diabetes, it would be advisable for you to know the levels of sugar in the blood. This level will determine the frequency in which you require taking your glucose tablets. Most people suffering from diabetes usually experience increased levels during the first few hours after taking their insulin.

The administration and use of anesthetic agents, such as propofol, can have a negative effect on the cognitive function of patients with FMR1 premutation carriers.

The use and administration, of propofool and other anesthetics, has been shown to cause a significant decline in cognitive functioning in patients diagnosed as having FTA. In fact, the use, and the effects of, propfofol, on FTX patients, is so significant that it has become a major concern for the medical community. It is important to note that the negative effects that propfol has on cognitive functions, in FTR patients is not limited to the FRTA population.

Are there any known anesthetic techniques that are less likely to increase FMR1?\nFragile X syndrome results in premature aging, and elderly men with Fragile-X have been shown to have cognitive impairment, particularly in attention and processing speed. As we age, a cognitive decline occurs which is most prevalent in these domains of memory and executive function. There is some evidence that patients in their late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s are at risk for developing Fragil-X, without the intellectual impairment of childhood Fragil X.\nMy question is: Are the cognitive deficits associated with late adolescent to mid-life age onset Fragilit-Y associated to the decreased expression, methylation, mutation of Fmr1, or other secondary (i.e., mitochondrial) pathologies? If so, why is the onset in the second decade and what is different from juvenile onset. Why do you see cognitive issues, but the physical impairments are more difficult to observe in this population?\nThe symptoms associated specifically with adult onset FRS are difficult for caregivers at all levels, including clinicians and families, to recognize, because this syndrome is often presented with subtle cognitive and language deficits that do not meet the threshold of the syndrome. The physical manifestations, in and of themselves, are sometimes not enough to cause alarm.", "Is one procedure safer than the other?\nFragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTA) is the most common form of inherited ataxias. A group of disorders affecting balance and coordination that also involve muscles of the eye, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Symptoms include tremors when reaching out, unsteady/gait, poor coordination and muscle weakness causing falls, difficulty chewing and swallowing, hearing loss, droopy eyelids, headaches, muscle cramps, numbness, blurred vision and difficulty remembering. It is named after the X chromosome gene FXS (a mutation in which causes it to be longer than usual), and is passed down through families. Patients affected, though, will have an extra 200\u20132,000 repeats of a nucleotide sequence in the DNA that makes up the FMR1 gene on the \u201cX\u201d chromosome, whereas in a typical person, the sequence will be made up of 6\u201353 copies. FXXAS symptoms can present in different ways. Often the disease is misdiagnosed for other neurodegenerative disorders. The symptoms may appear in varying degrees and develop over a prolonged period of time. For many, FTXAS is a slowly progressive disorder. Some people with the Fragile-X full gene mutation or permutation can develop a mild form FTA, called fragile X premutation, in as little as 50 people in every million; however, it is often under- recognized, until other serious symptoms present. There are no known treatments or a cure for FAXAS.\nFAXS patients frequently complain of pain and discomfort around their kneecaps. Due to the patient's difficulty with balancing and proprioception, or position sense, there is no proper cushioning of their knees. They may also experience frequent falls leading to fractures. As a surgeon, I usually recommend total knee replacement for patients with FARTS. However, several issues can arise when patients receive anesthesia during total joint replacement. First, they are unable to feel the lower limb and have loss of muscle control. This makes re-positioning the knee during surgery harder for the resident. Furthermore, these patients may struggle with post-surgical narcotic pain control, as the medication is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier and help with pain.\nThere is less research on a person\u2019s cognitive function following anesthesia for knee-arthroscopic", "- Cognitive function after surgery in a series of patients with fragile X syndrome-related intellectual disability\nBackground: Anesthesia for hip replacements is common for patients displaying intellectual disabilities.\nHowever, the use of propofol may have some drawbacks. In particular, propofi l has been shown to enhance levels of serotonin and impair cognitive ability when present in high doses. These alterations may cause problems when administering the drug in frail patients. One of the major cognitive disorders associated with intellectual impairment is the fragile x syndrome (FXS). While individuals with FXS do not develop fragile-x-associated tremor/ ataxia syndrome, (FXT AS) until the sixth or seventh decade of life, their sisters typically have a late onset of symptoms, often in their fifth or sixth decade.\nMoreover, there are similarities between FX S and F XT A S, such as cognitive impairment and tremors. Therefore we considered whether propolf-containing anesthetics administered during anesthesia for a hip operation would have negative effects after six weeks of follow up. The present study evaluates whether the propoff used in anesthetic procedures may affect cognitive function during the postoperative period.\nMethods: In this study, we analyzed the correlation between cognitive performance following anesthesia and surgical intervention with propaff - containing an anesthesics. Fifteen patients were recruited, each of them with F X S-related 1 D, and post-hip replacement surgeries. To study this problem, a standardized cognitive assessment battery was administered to all the patients, and a control group without any intellectual or learning problems. Cognitive performance was evaluated before and after the hip surgery. We hypothesized that patients experiencing cognitive deficits related to F XS - and who had received the anesthesia containing propoffs would show additional impairments and worse cognitive outcomes, which could then be used to predict the effect of treatments for FXR ASP in the elderly.\nResults: We did not find any significant relationship between intellectual and learning disabilities resulting from fragili x - caused cognitive impairaments and the amount of propr f aneshetics used during surgery: our patients did show increased memory impairment, but their results did improve after a few weeks. However, when compared to the control groups, patients had worse memory performance than usual. This result suggests that the addition of pr opopil to pro p off could have contributed to this pattern, making the result statistically significant.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that propopf-containing anesthesia does not have significant", "A new study, published in the May issue of Anesthesiology, the medical journal of the American Society of anesthesiologists (ASA), reports that an elderly woman with Fxtas, who underwent anesthetic induction at age 51 for hip resection arthroplasty, did not experience the same kind of memory impairment that is typically seen in Fmr1-knockout mice, a kind mouse that may be used to model FMR1 premutation symptoms.\nThe report also looked at how long-term use of different anesthesia agents, such as isoflurane (a chemical used for inducing anesthesia in surgical procedures) may, or may not, affect cognitive function in adults diagnosed with the Fxr1 gene mutation.\nAccording to the authors, \u201cAs this mutation encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein, it is of great interest to determine whether the brain pathologies in knockout mice cause memory dysfunction.\u201d Also interesting to note is that the mice used in this study only have the full mutation of Fxm1 (the male version of fmr 1), and not the premutations (which is found in women), which are responsible for most Fmds and Fragile X associated conditions (FAXs).\nWhile the fmk knockout mouse does experience memory deficits as they age, compared to \u201cwild-type mice,\u201d the researchers found no change in memory function following isosflurone administration.\nAs you may recall from previous blogs, when I wrote about a study from 2015 in which mice injected with human blood cells from a patient with fbrmrp1 syndrome, were subjected to prolonged anesthetics, including isopropyl alcohol, they showed deficits in spatial memory and social behaviors.\nIn the present study however, not only did the mouse with a FXR1 mutation lack memory changes after anesthesia administration, but also there was no increased neuroinflammation with long term exposure of isiffluran, whereas this effect was present when the wild-type mouse was exposed to isoffluran.\nPrevious post: Frustration or Resentment \u2013 Can it Cause Harm?\nNext post : Fragilesx Blog Awarded Best Blog at the International Fxs Conference!", "What is FMRP?

Executive functioning are processes that support our cognitive skills that allow us to make decisions, manage time, set goals, and plan.\u00a0 These are the same cognitive functions that are needed to manage the events and tasks of daily living. The role of executive function in daily life is a primary factor in determining a patient's independence.\nIn the pre-surgical interview, it is important for the neurosurgeon to be familiar with the cognitive symptoms of an FMr1 mutation associated with Fmrtas. During the anesthetic interview it may be informative to assess for attention, concentration, executive cognitive, memory,\u00a0 and language.\u00a0\nAnesthetics\u00a0 can have an affect on the patients cognition when they are being administered. There are different protocols used that can effect patients differently. For some patients, propofol is the preferred anesthesia for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Ketamine, dexmedetomidine, or remifentanil, are recommended for patients with autism spectrum. Other anesthesias are used depending on medical issues, medications, the type of surgery being done and the desires of the patient.

There are different types of infections for which S. pneumoniae are responsible, including pharyngitis and otitis media, but also pneumonia and meningitis in the middle ear. A serious blood borne disease is bacterial sepsis caused by S.Pneumoniae. Wageners granulomatosis is an autoimmune disease in which blood vessels become inflamed and eventually can rupture. Though not directly associated with pneumonia, it is caused most commonly by bacteria.

I hope I got your question right, if not, feel free to ask, or check with your doctor. Have a nice day. Sincerely, Dr. D", "A study in mice on the role of cross-reactive T helper cells.\nABSTRACT : Streptozyme antibodies are typically present in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). The question of a possible relation between StreptoG, infection and WG has not yet been settled. In 1982 we described the induction of WG in rats sensitized to group A strep. We now investigated the hypothesis that a cross-reaction between T cells sensitised to strepto-G and the vascular basement membrane explains how strepi-G infection could be pathogenetically involved in WG. BALB/c mice immunized with group G strepo. (N. Lactis) 10 days prior to sensitization with BN rat glomeruli developed a markedly increased severity of glonephritis compared with immunologically normal, control mice (p? 0.0001). Immunohistochemical staining showed that most of the cells in this group consisted of CD3, CD4 and CD8 positive cells with a Tregulatory phenotype (CD25, Fox P3). Anti-GAM or isotype control immunoglobulins induced comparable T cell responses. These results implicate a role for cross reactivity between strepteoccal group-specific antigens and glom. antig (GBM) in the aggravation of experimental GN. Group-specific crossreactions may also be involved with the streptic reaction in Wegeners gran. It appears that strepci antibodies and bacterial antigen are not pathogenic in themselves but rather are markers of an earlier, more fundamental event involving a strong inflammatory reaction.\nUnknown Presence of Streptomucoid (S. intermedii) Antigen in 33% of Uveitis Patients Without Prior History of Upper Respiratory Disease and with Anterior Uveal and Vitreal Granuloma.\nProject description: Background.The role that Strepmucoidal infections play in uveitic disease has been well studied, however, little research has focused on Streptonucoids in anterior uveal granuleomas.

What kind?\nDear Dr. Cohen,\nA recent blood test report shows that the white blood cell count showed high S. viridans, 19 (95 % confidence interval 17 to 21 %). The report says this can cause serious infection, and that this may help to make a diagnosis of systemic vasculitis. This makes me think that S Viridians may cause another disease apart from Strep throat and scarlet fever. Is there anyway strepto can infect the nervous system or the brain in another way than going into the blood, (which should be called a blood borne infection)? Also, can it go into one of the organs apart form the heart? It shows up on a biopsy as M. SSSA. Does that mean some Ss Sssa got into me at the same time as the Sviridens?\nThese are great questions, but we need to provide some context. I can understand your concern with a \u201c high\u201d reported S viridan s count. However, there is no specific illness associated with this high white count in any way resembling a fever or illness, or a specific immune system condition called Wegener\u2019s. Wegeners may resemble a vasovili tis (a common immune inflammatory reaction). If this was truly the case there would be many signs and symptoms associated, specifically with regard to the \u201cvasculit is \u201c.\nS viriden s is a normal common skin flora. It is not an infect ion agent nor does it cause disease per se. It can however, infect humans. The question is, how does a skin comm ensal become a systemic systemic infectious agent? You mention you had a recent biopsy, which most likely was done to rule out an active systemic inflammatory illness such a cancer. Sometimes you have a specimen that is sent for a histology (microscopic examination).\u00a0 However for most purposes, the lab simply will culture the specimen on agar plate. In your case, we must ask the laboratory for its results, so as to better understand the context of its presence on tissue. (If not on the report, ask for more details)\nIf there was no active infection at he time of surgery this result is simply reflecting the fact that you could have had this organism on your skin.\nThe term \u201c MSSA\u201d is more interesting because it might mean a drug-resistant bacterial species.\u00a0 In", "Is there a connection between this type of infection and heart disease?\nYes. The strep infection is the most common cause of the Rheumatoscoid antibody. This antibody can cause Rheumatic fever or other autoimmune problems like SLE, Wegener's granulomatosis which causes vasculitis as well as other problems. It can be associated with myocarditis, however, this is rare. Generally, you need to treat the initial streps with antibiotics even if the Strep infection was treated early and you think she is well.

In addition when I go for my annual checkup (I started one several years when the doctor told me I needed to do so) they also test for glaucoma. So my doctor has told that smoking does not cause this disease, however it can have negative repercussions on a persons general health and can make conditions such as this and Glaucomna harder to control and monitor.\nAs far as the secondhand smoke or any other smoke around you, the best thing I can say is watch your diet, follow the diet that has been recommended and try to eliminate as much as you can from you life that can cause you general stress etc. All the very best to you on your journey and don't get discouraged if the changes that are recommended do not produce the results for you that you would like to see.\nMichael:", "Thank You and God Bless You!\nWhen it comes to cigarette smoke there are two things it is very important to make a clear distinction about: First hand and secondhand smoke. A majority of the research regarding smoking and AMD has been done on the firsthand variety, which is the kind that occurs when smoke is inhaled directly. Firsthand smoking is definitely a risk factor for advanced AMD or wet macular degeneration, because it\u2019s an inflammatory process, and many studies have shown inflammation to be a huge threat for AMD.\nHowever, when it has to do with the second version of smoke, known as second-hand smoke (sometimes called \u201cPassive Smoking), things get a little murkier. Many health professionals have long suspected that it could play a role in eye disease, but for years studies and research have not necessarily supported those fears. The studies that have been conducted suggest that while smokers are definitely at risk, this risk is much smaller for the nonsmokers who live or work alongside these smokers.\nResearch shows the relationship between early and advanced maculopathy and smoke exposure is not clear. To further complicate or confuse matters the studies also found a higher risk for macu-lopathy with both passive and active smoking.

Is this true?\nFertilization is the process by which the sperm and egg unite to form a zygote. This process takes about 24 hours after the egg is released from the ovary. The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus where it implants. Implantation usually occurs about a week after fertilizaton.", "And if not, what causes it?\nFertilization is the first step in the development of both normal pregnancies and mola r pregnancies. In fertilized eggs, and only fertilised egg cells, a complete set of chromosomes are inherited. Fertilized egg cell divide by a process called mitosis to create daughter cells each with a matching set chromosomes. Chromosomal divisions do not happen in nonfertilised (unfertlized) egg that is destined to turn into a hydatidiform mole (molar prengnancy) because the fertilisation of cells do no occur.\nHydatiform moles occur when an unfertilisde egg (ie, the one containing 23 maternal and 0 paternal chromosomes) is fertilizes by two sperm, giving rise to a fetus with 46 chromosomes, but only half maternal (23) and half paternal ( 22). The fertilizaton of unmated eggs by one sperm results in a child with two copies of every chromosomes and a total of 77 chromosmoomes.

Prior to fertilizing the ovam, the sperm has to get through the cervical mucus, swim up to the uterine cavity through your cervical canal, and pass through into your fallopian tube where it meets up with the waiting egg that has just been released from your ovary. There the actual union between sperm and egg occurs. It's important to note that a normal menstrual cycle is required for this whole process to be successful.\nIf fertilziation has taken place, it's only the beginning of the process - the zygote (fertilized egg) still has a long way to go to develop into a new life.", "Thanks!\nIf an embryo never develops in the womb, you get a condition called a'missed miscarriage', also called an 'embryonic pregnancy'. After this time passes, the body naturally reabsorbs the fluid, placenta, and other tissue. In the case of a completed miscarriages that are still in womb when passed, we don't know exactly when the embryo no longer grew.\nAn ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy where the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus (usually in a Fallopian tube). Even in this situation, it is an implantation and can therefore be considered pregnancy-like. If the pregnancy continues then the baby cannot develop and usually the woman becomes extremely sick, so these pregnancies are terminated (or have been). I would think it's also a case where there would be no fetus, but the implanted placental tissue and associated fluids would cause the same reaction.\nWhen the egg is fertilised by sperm (when sex happens) it moves into the fallopipian tubes and if it implants there it will be an aborrtion or hydatiform mole but if sperm reaches the vagina and there is no sex a hydragmoma can occur.\nI think they mean a human person.\nThere may be lots of other definitions but there are only two that really matter, to a Humanist.\nFirst there\u2019s the religious definition, which is the one I most object to.\n\u201cGod the Father and Jesus the Son made a sperm and an ovum unite.\u201d\nThis is not a definition that is based on knowledge, observation, reason or the available evidence.\nIt\u2019s a made-up, fantasy, fiction and a nonsense.\nSecond thing that matters is this..\nIs there any observable evidence of human \u2018people\u2019, as in children, being manufactured when sperm enters an ova.\nThe answer is quite clearly, no.\nBut all the reasons that that fact applies to human children also apply to sheep or goats or a zebra or an ape.

I would like to know if there is a difference between the two.\nArthritis is an inflammation of the joints. It is not a disease, it is the name of a group of diseases. There are over 100 different types of Arthritis. The most common types are Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthrits, Gout, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arhritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Scleroderma, Polymyositis and Dermatomyosistis, Reiter's Syndrome, Lyme Disease, Fibromyalgia, Juvenile Rheumatois Artritis (JRA), and Sjogren's syndrome. Arthriritis is usually a chronic disease that can be treated with medication, physical therapy, exercise, weight loss, or surgery. Hypehnic Peroneal Neuropathy (HNP) is caused by a genetic mutation in the PMP22 gene. This mutation causes the nerve to become smaller and thinner. As the nerves become thinner, they become more susceptible to damage. Symptoms of this disease include numbness, tingling, burning, pain, weakness, cramping, muscle atrophy, foot drop, difficulty walking, balance problems, loss of coordination, etc. Treatment for HYP includes physical and occupational therapy to help maintain muscle strength and prevent muscle loss. Medications such as Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta, Elavil, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, Nortriptiline, Pregabalin, Duloxetine, Venlafaxine, Trazodone, Zoloft, Paxil and Effexor can help with pain and nerve damage.\nI have HSNP and I also have arthritis in my hands.

Are these therapies also available here in Malaysia?\nThere are many possibilities for treatment, depending on the stage of the disease and the extent of weakness.\nIn mild cases, physical therapy may help people, but it depends on how much their arms and legs are weak and how fast this is deteriorating.\nMore commonly in CIDPs, a series of intravenous injections of Ig (IV-Gammaglobulin) is given once a week for a month, followed by maintenance of injections every 2-3 weeks. Although the improvement does not last long after the initial period of treatment with IV-Gam, the treatment of IV IG can be given indefinitely.\nPlasmapheresis is rarely tried as a treatment for CIDPS because it has few benefits for this particular disorder, although it can sometimes help in other rare neurological disorders such as MG.\nThere have been two new treatments recently developed that show promise: Rituximab, which has a similar mechanism of action as IV Ig, except it is a monoclonal antibody (that recognizes and binds to a marker or molecule that circulates in B- lymphocytes,) and one IV or SC injection kills off those B-cells which in turn, stops the production of certain parts of myelin which are responsible for attacking our own bodies. In theory, at least, we do eventually make fresh or new myelinated nerves by a replacement effect. This is only just now getting established for use, so we have learned the hard way that sometimes, it will take upwards of a year or even more to see the myriads of positive and negative effects these things can have on us. But, in general, those who do not improve after plasmophoresis (the procedure of drawing the blood from the body and treating it on a machine so that it removes antibodies), the same people have often improved dramatically or at the least partially when treated with Ritoximbi.

Other symptoms include jaw pain, scalp tenderness, fever, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, visual disturbances, diplopia and blindness. Patients may also experience a change in the color of their skin, such as redness or discoloration. Some patients may experience an increase in their blood pressure, while others may have a decrease in blood flow to their extremities. If left untreated, this disease may lead to permanent damage to organs such a heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, intestines, brain, spinal cord, eyes, ears, nose, throat, mouth, teeth, gums, tongue, lips, skin and hair.\nIn order to diagnose GCG, a physician will perform a physical examination and review the patient\u2019s medical history. A blood test may be performed to check for anemia, elevated white blood cell count, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An eye examination may reveal signs of inflammation in one or both eyes. Imaging tests such, as a CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, angiography, venography or arteriovenous fistula may help to confirm the diagnosis. Biopsy of affected tissue may show evidence of granulation tissue, giant cell formation, necrosis, fibrosis and calcification.\nTreatment for GGC includes corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, anticoagulants and vasodilators. Surgery may sometimes be necessary to remove affected arteries or veins. Physical therapy", "Dr. Prasad Rao answers this for Health2Biz.\nGiant Cell Arteritis or also known as \u201cTemporal Arterioritis\u201d is an inflammation or irritation of the temporal artery (located within the temple region of your face) and other body arteries.\nIt is commonly observed in old age. The most common symptom reported is throbbing or pounding headache, often one sided or over the temples on the back side of head. Along with this there may not be other symptoms.\nTreatment is with regular intake of steroid medication, usually prednisolone or Dexamethasone. It is given for upto 2 years and the frequency and dose is decided by the doctor based on your status. Once treated, there are no long term complications.\nSo, this is how you need to follow up with your doctor and treat the condition so that there is no permanent damage to the arteries which can be very dangerous.\nThank you for sharing this useful information about Giant cell arteritis, we are a patient support community that helps patients on their path to wellness; feel free to use our platform to share and exchange information.\nDear Ashwin, Thank you.

Find answers to all your queries here.\nGiant cell arteritis is a rare disease in which the inflammatory cells affect the lining of arteries in the head and neck, causing swelling of that area. The condition is also known as cranial giant cell arteries or temporal arteritises. It is more common in women than men. And in people over 50.\nIn the early stages, the most common symptoms are severe headache and tiredness. Over time, patients start to have pain and tenderness in their jaw, scalp pain, nausea, vomiting and sometimes loss of vision.\nThere is no known cure, but anti-inflammatory drugs are given to keep the arteries healthy. But surgery is needed in certain severe cases. Avoiding stress is very important and it is always easier to prevent the disease than cure it, so get your body checked by a doctor at least once in a year.\nThe giant cells are also called as multinucleated cells. Normally, multinuclear cells appear in cells that are highly active, such as osteoclasts, fibroblasts and macrophages. These multinulear cells or giant-cells found in blood vessel wall is considered by many to be a hallmark of giant-cell arteriopathy. Other than in vasuclitic syndromes, giantcells are seen in patients who have atherosclerosis in some arterial segments (which may indicate preexisting, concurrent atheromatous arteropathy) or in those who are taking certain corticosteroids. Some cases of polymyalgia rheumatica giant-ceils arteritic as well as nonarteritic are reported.\nSome other diseases such a polymyalsia rheumatics and Takayasu disease have also showed giant ceils cells in tissue that is infected. This disease mostly affects people above the age of 40. There in few reported cases where children have been affected.\nFor more information, consult: Dr. Ravi Shankar, Arthroplasty & Spine Surgeon (Consultant) - Medicover Fertility & Infertility Centre\nMumbai, India.

The headache is often described as a severe, diffuse pounding pain that occurs at night. Other symptoms may include high fever, weakness, weight loss, and fatigue. Patients often have aching and stiffness in the neck, shoulders and upper back. In addition, they may have jaw pain and difficulty in opening the jaw (jaw stiffness is commonly described by the patient as difficulty chewing). Because the disease occurs more commonly in individuals older than 50, many feel they are just too old for them.

{"Question": "How do I find out if my fibromyalgia is genetic?", "Free_form_answer": "Is fibromyalgia hereditary? Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Must_have": ["Fibromyalgia is not directly passed from parents to children.", "The disorder does tend to cluster within families.", "The chances of developing fibromyalgia are higher in families with a history of the disorder.", "There are certain genes that are associated with the increased risk of fibromyalgia, which play a role in your nervous system's response to pain."], "Nice_to_have": ["Studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia have identified a number of genes that could help explain why the disorder seems to run in families.", "Some of the same genes associated with fibromyalgia are also linked with depression and anxiety, which may explain why certain antidepressant medications can help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms."], "sample_predictions": ["I have a sister who has it and I am wondering if I will get it too.\nFibromalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and tenderness in the muscles and joints.

Fibroma can be found on any part of the body, including the face, neck, chest, back, arms, legs, hands, feet, or genitals. They are usually small and round, with smooth edges. Some fibrosarcomas are flat and look like moles. Others are raised and may have small bumps on them. Most fibrous tumors are not cancerous, although some can become cancer if they grow large enough. The most common type is called a dermal fibrosis, which is found in people who are overweight or obese. Other types include: -A fibroid tumor, also called an ovarian fibroadenoma -An endometrial fibroids, found inside the uterus -Cervical fibrotic tumors, located in women\u2019s reproductive organs -Testicular fibrocystic disease, affecting men\u2019s testicles -Lymph node fibrolipoma\nHow is fiboma diagnosed?\nFiboyma is diagnosed by a physical examination and a biopsy. A biopsy is when a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and sent to a laboratory for testing. This test can tell if the fibra is cancer or not. Fiboys are also diagnosed with imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan. These tests can show if a tumor is growing or shrinking.\nWhat are the signs of a Fibro?\nA Fibra can cause pain and swelling in your joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, cartilage, nerves, blood vessels, skin,", "Will my child have it?\nDoes anyone in my family have fibro?\nWhy do you think you got it and your family didn\u2019t?\nWhat were the chances I would get it since one person in the family had it?

A patient can have their DNA profiled to identify specific polymorphisms. Polymorphhips may provide information regarding pain management.\nFibromylagia is linked to HLA-DRB1*11 and HLAB*5 alleles.

As you age, your monthly period may be irregular and less frequent due to the natural low levels of progsterones.This can also cause menopause. Because of this, taking an oral progstergene pill with estrogen is the best option for helping women cope with menopastal symptoms. These symptoms include hot flushes, vaginal dryness, reduced libido, anxiety, decreased bone density. Taking progserone can prevent osteoporosis and heart disease in women.\nThe drug has many unwanted side-effects including bloated feelings in your abdomen which could disrupt your sex life.

My mother died of ovarian cancer. I do not have any children. Do estrogen patches have a protective effect against ovarian and/or uterine cancer? Should I continue use patches, or is the length of time I have used them unimportant?\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative Study clearly shows that estrogen use after the onset of menopause increases the incidence of cancer of the breast for women who have not had hysterectomy (removal of uterus), because the cancer occurs when estrogen is taken (in the form of estrogen pills or transdermal patches). The estrogen, which is a \"estrogen-like-steroid hormone\", acts to promote the normal growth of breast tissue, and it can act to accelerate growth and uncontrolled multiplication of normal cells (hyperplasia), so leading to a higher cancer risk. There is also an increased risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of womb lining) from estrogen treatment, especially in women not having had their ovaries removed. Fortunately, the uterus and endocrine (hormonal) control system is not dependent completely on the ovariy, but its own reproductive \"control center\" also has an influence on these events. The uterus is affected by the estrogen which helps the lining regenerate properly for the purpose of implantation of a newly fertilized ovum, so promoting early pregnancy. It is for this reason that there is increased endoemtrial cancer when there has been no previous pregnancy, since the endomterial cells become very active after cessation of menstruation for lack of hormone control of these cells. A protective influence of pregnancy in the woman who had ever been pregnant, is that the level of progesterone rises to inhibit the mitotic (cell division) activity of utero-lining cells to prevent the uteral lining from proliferating (excessive cell division). This is seen both in pregnancy and after menopouse (so called post-menopausel \"spotting\"). There has always been speculation that breast cancer may occur more frequently in childless women; it now appears that this is true. Why this should be the case is probably related to the effect of estrogens on breast \"tissue-lymphoid-stroma composition\".

Also, what is a \"good\" amount of wax/obstruction to keep in there?\nWe recommend against routine irrigation of the outer ear canal with peroxidized hydrogen perioxide or other agents and/or the use of cotton swabs for clearing the ears. Our recommendation is based on concerns over the risk of damage to the sensitive tissues (drums, eardrums) of this area as well as the possibility of introducing bacteria from the swab or solution into the middle ear.

Is this correct? If so, have you seen any research articles on this subject?\nThe brain does affect the human heart but it does not completely or directly control it. The sympathetic nerves to and parasympathetic nerves from (the brain) heart are directly involved in altering the functioning of heart muscle during periods of activity/stress, exercise, rest and sleep. Thus, these nerves provide for some degree of nervous modulation and direction of functioning but this is not a complete control of cardiac function. Instead we think of such control as being more like a governor of a car engine controlling the output of fuel to motor according to a programmed direction from a computer. There is some feedback and control, but the mechanism is one that is regulated at a distance from cardiac tissue. In fact, in animals which have been prepared, it has been found that the muscles of their heart beat continuously even if isolated and removed from an otherwise normal animal. Therefore, this response in a cardiac muscle is truly an automatic one, which is the basis for our term \"cardiac\" meaning automatic beating or function of muscle.\nIs there a relationship between depression and heart disease and / or strokes?\nThere are associations between these conditions, i.e., depression, and stroke as in acute and chronic heart failure. These associations are seen in both sexes, although the associations appear to be greater in males. Recent studies indicate that depression is also a predictor of survival. Specifically, depression appears to elevate mortality rates among patients discharged from hospitals and patients with high blood pressure and congestive heart", "I was told to do this and now I am worried that I may have harmed the function of the tympanic membrane.\nThe answer depends on whether or not the cerumen imparts a protective or a pathological effect.

Also, Strode and colleagues showed that middle ear function is better maintained in a cat model of ceruminous otitis media (Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. Oct 1997; 99(10 Pt 1):824-8).

M. de Azevedo, Associate Professor, MD\nBackground Sevofluorane is a volatile anesthetic agent that is used in clinical practice. The stability of the drug in the container after the seal has opened is unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness, stability and safety of a sevolfurano solution after opening the bottle. Methods A total of 60 patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 (n = 30) received sevolflurana solution from a new bottle, and Group II (30 patients) was given sevfluran solution that had been stored in a bottle for 24 h. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with sevlfurao. After 15 min, the patients received a bolus of fentanyl (1 \u03bcg/kg) and the sevfuran concentration was measured. Results The mean (SD) age of patients was 42.3 (15.1) yr. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, weight, height, sex, or duration of anesthesia. In Group I, sevulfur concentration decreased from 2.0% to 0.5% after 4 h, whereas in Group III, it decreased to only 3.2% in 6 h (P < 0001). The concentration of inhaled sevulflurae was significantly lower in patients in group II than in those in Grup I (0, 5 \u00b1 01% vs. 02 \u00b10 05%, respectively; P <0. 001). There was no difference in hemodynamic parameters between groups.

The study also measured effects on the patient\u2019s response to pain, pain reduction and the severity of pain.\nThe mean pH of the two control samples was significantly lower than the one with the filter when the samples were combined and then taken independently. When the data were taken separately, the mean pKa of samples with filters was not significantly different from the ones without the filters, but the average pKb values were significantly higher. The mean peak of pB values was higher among the participants who had Isoflowers without filters and lower among those who did not have the bacterial filters. Isoflower with filter and Isofleur without filter resulted in comparable mean percentages of patients with moderate to high pT levels. Both Isoflores without bacterial and bacterial Isofuor with or without a bacterial were associated with reduced pain intensity.\nThese results suggest that storage may have an effect on sevolurines due to pH changes and that this could possibly affect response of individuals to isoflue.\nFenestrations are small holes into the wall of a nerve, often present in cases of cranial nerves. They are an area of abnormal connection between the external and internal portions of one\u2019s nerves.\nBecause of this unique trait, many people find it difficult to remember how to make an appointment with their ENT physician so they may undergo diagnostic or surgical procedures for fenestration. However, if one can make a proper visit to their office as part of their schedule, they will be able to find out more about their condition in addition to learning ways to treat their symptoms.\nThis article will include a list of questions that can help you determine if you may need any further investigation from your doctor about fenestrated craniofacial surgeries.\nCan I make my appointment online?\nSome doctors who have patients who experience fenesters use the internet for the first time for appointments. This allows them", "What is a safe time frame for the sevohflurance to retain maximum quality?\nThis question addresses the issues of stability in the opened container under conditions of reasonable use, as opposed to the storage conditions recommended on the label, and the effectiveness of anesthetic concentration of the material after the container is opened. The first part of your question is answered by the expiration date printed on every opened package of a volatile anesthestic. While the contents may have changed significantly, it is expected that the delivered anatomic concentration remain constant. This is not always the case, of course, because of differences among manufacturers. Thus, while a study of concentration over time is impractical, the use of concentrations that have been shown to be valid within the limits of clinical usefulness is recommended. Since an actual expiration time has not been set, recommendations have not be made as to how far off expiration a container should be used. You may wish to contact the manufacturer for recommendations regarding the time period within which these products remain stable. In general, they state on their labels that any opened anesthesetics should not, per FDA regulation, be mixed with others in a syringe or other container.", "A review of the literature\nSevofur ane is a stable inhalational volatile anaesthetic agent that is commonly used in both adults and children during general anaesthesia.

However, they were able to perform an indirect comparison of data from several studies of similar designs. They found the data on storage of open sevolfuranes was consistent between studies, therefore they extrapolated to provide an answer to the review question.\nHow did they complete their review?\nThe authors conducted an electronic search in the following databases:\nThey also searched trial registries and websites for relevant studies.\nThey conducted their research according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines for systematic reviews.\nTwo reviewers independently selected suitable studies. Data extraction was independently carried out by three reviewers. Study quality was assessed using criteria suggested by The Cocharne Collaboration.\nOutcome measures of stability were defined as maintenance of isoflavone concentration; effectiviness as induction time; and toxic effects as a measurement for concentrations of compounds related to sevvolurana degradation, e.g. compound A, B or C in plasma concentrations.\nWhat were the results of their study?\nAll the available data were from experimental studies rather than clinical studies.There were no experimental clinical data. There were several inconsistencies between published studies.The stability of storage was related ot the frequency of opening.

The other forms of this disorder, or conditions are: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder.? The question of,?What causes these disorders? Is the answer still unknown. They can run in the family so some scientists believe that the causes are genetic, and environmental factors may have a role in their development. It is also thought that a combination of genetic and biological factors, plus a dysfunctional family life, may contribute to these conditions.\nThe behaviors, symptoms and characteristics of children with Opposition defiant Disorder are:\n1.? Constant arguments with parents and other adults.\n2.? Refuses to comply with adult requests and rules.\n3.? Blames others for their mistakes.\n4.? Often spiteful and vengeful, especially when they are caught doing the wrong thing.\n5.? Frequently loses their temper.\n6.? Is often angry and resentful.\n7.? May express irritation.\n8.?

It is not due to anything else, for instance a lack of intellectual capacity for the age, and it does not fit any of the criteria for another disorder.?\nThe following is a short list to give an flavour of some of these behaviours but there are too many to be able to fully give all of them here.? Opposition to adult authority. Being easily angered. Argues with adults. Often actively annoys people. Blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehaviour. Is often touchy or easily annoyed by others.\nIs often angry or resentful. Talks back to parents and adults in authority.? The child should not have other mental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, depression, etc. and the negative behaviour must occur and be evident for more than six months.\nThese things have been found to help parents to change their children's defiance: The parents do not provoke the child, they do so themselves. The parent learns to speak calmly and to remain in control. He or she only uses 'time out' as a last resort, in the case of dangerous, harmful or destructive behaviour.? This will be dealt with more widely in a later article.", "?\nOppositional defiant disorder is characterized by the child or adolescent having a pattern of defying or resisting requests or limitations, arguing with adults or refusing to follow the rules. The behavior is present for three months or longer, occurs in a variety of settings and represents the childs usual manner of behavior, not his or her behavior in response to a specific circumstance.?\nChildren with this condition often show several of the following: lose temper more easily than other children, have bad moods, are touchy or easily annoyed, get angry when they do not get their way, act vengefully or seek revenge, actively defy or deliberately bother people, do things to annoy others, blame others for mistakes or misbehavior, feel little or no guilt, and show irritability.", "It seems strange, this question has not previously appeared as a question on Answers.\nThe answer from Answers:\nOppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a type of disorder and characterized by a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures that fails to decline as expected between childhood and adolescence. The diagnosis of ODD is generally given to children who are seven years old and above.\nOpposite of opposition\nThe meaning of the word \"opposition\" in the expression \"Oppposition Defiance Disorder\" (\"ODDbear\") is simply the opposite of what you may think by the way it is written. Opposite does not mean contrary (as in opposite sides of a line) but rather in a general sense as opposites of other words. Example:\nA person may be \"nice\" while another may do things that are less than nice. I could say that one person is \"defant,\" and the other is the \"ant\" of it. You can have opposity of color or behavior.\nPeople that I know seem to have ODDD because they are the type that can argue or fight. They show opposition in that way, not to show disrespect or bad feelings, but only to get attention from their parents. A lot of these kids are quite smart (or at least that is what their mother tells them), but they don't act like it; instead, they often do silly things or put on an act to gain attention. There tends to be a personality difference in kids with ODDS or opposition defiance disorder. These kids need a firm hand; the kids who do so well at school don\u2019t want to spend another day with you.\nThis disorder is diagnosed in children; however, in some places, there are adults who also have this disorder.\nDo you want all the answers?\nThe fact that this problem appears at about the time a child begins to talk and has an impact on life suggests that the problem may exist in parents as well.\nAs a parent, I can look back at my own life and see that my mother was this type personality. She was a wonderful woman and a very good and loving mother but she always had an internal battle with herself. To be herself yet be what society expected of women at that time was hard. Then her children arrived and as with all good mothers, she gave her all to both her child and to the job of being a good mother. Yet another internal war", "The child is not able to control the inner impulse to oppose things that are in place or that authority and rules.?There are several other things attached to the disorder such as not listening to what an adult is saying or not obeying the instruction given.? They tend to say no when asked to do something or may tell an outright lie if necessary to get their way and to avoid performing a task that is in conflict with their desires.?They are often disrespectful and may talk back.? Some people think the condition is a product of the environment in which the child was raised but Dr. Martin has a different take on that particular issue.?Many of these children are taught to behave in such a way at a very young age and are disciplined if they attempt to be different and show good behavior.?Most people do not accept the idea of a child rebelling against them because it does not feel right and we do everything that we feel is necessary so that it will not occur.? Dr Martin, however, is suggesting that the behavior may be due to some kind of genetic defect in the brain where the impulse control areas do work efficiently and the problem with control will manifest itself as behavior which is out of order and considered to affect negatively in relationships.?He also suggests a kind and sensitive approach to children rather than the authoritarian one when attempting to deal with this behavioral issue.\n?It is essential that you use a gentle, loving, accepting approach.

{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition.

These include ciprofloxacin, levofloxin, and ceftriaxone.\nWhat is citrobacteria?\nCitrobactera is an infection caused by the bacteria Citrullus vulgaris. This bacteria is found naturally in soil and water, as well as in some animals and humans.\nCitro bacteria can infect the urinary tract, lungs, skin, or other parts of the body. Symptoms of citro bacterium infection include fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and swelling of lymph nodes.\nThe most serious complication of a citr o bacteremia infection is sepsis (blood poisoning). Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death if not treated quickly.\nHow do you get citobacte ria?\nThere are a few ways that you can get Citrobatia. One way is through contact with contaminated water or food. Another way to get it is by breathing in contaminated air. Finally, you could also get infected by coming into contact directly with the bacteri a itself.\nIf you think you may have been exposed to Citroatia, it\u2019s important to see a doctor as soon as possible.

She has treated many patients with successful outcomes through personalized treatment plans for individuals with a variety of medical conditions.\nCITROBACTER- WHAT DOES IT MEAN?\nCitrobactor is a species of bacterial\u00a0families that are associated with water and are also known as Citromicrobium.\nThese micro-organisms are gram-negative and have the ability to oxidize malic acid, sorbitol, maltose, salicin, xylitol and glycerol. Additionally, they can oxidise citrate within four hours and therefore grow on MacConkey agar, in contrast to non-oxidation by some bacteria.\nThe Citro group is responsible for the growth of Citobacter species.\nCitro is the Latin name for Malus domestica or apple tree.\nTYPICAL SIGN AND SYMPTOMS\nCitobactor typically causes infections in people who have had surgery to remove or repair part of one or all of their intestines. This type of operation is called a bowel preparation. During the operation, the surgeon will remove part or the entire length of the intestine that has become infected, often called the colon. After surgery, this section of intesting may be filled with the bacterium Citrabacter. If not treated early enough, people with Citrbactor infection may experience symptoms such as fever, chills, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. The symptoms may also include a painful lump in or around the abdomen.\nIt also occurs in immunocompromised infants and patients, usually when they are hospitalized in intensive care units.\nIn the USA, it is one of many common causes of urinary tract infections.\nSymptoms of a urinary catheter infection include:\nUrinary tract infection symptoms include: increased urination frequency and urgency; blood in your stool; burning feeling after peeing.\nHOW IS IT CAUSED?\nA urinary infection is most likely caused by something that irritates the urinary system.\nWhat exactly does it do", "A quick glance at the history\nThe bacterial genus Citrobac has been recognized for more than 150 years but there wasn't much of scientific research on this genus of bacteria. The first scientific mention of this microorganism can be found in 1858 when a bacterium was isolated from a water sample that showed an ability to grow on citrate. However, it took more time till the bacterrial genus was defined. More than sixty species have been described so far.\nThe Citracrobatus have a wide spread on our planet. Their presence in a certain ecological niche is often associated with polluted water.\nCitrobactera infect in different ways. In some cases there are no signs of infection. These bacteria can remain in the human body for a long time and not cause serious complications. They usually live in stomach and intestines. Sometimes bacteria migrate to other organs and cause inflammation of the brain, joints, kidneys, lungs or muscles.\nSome Citrocroacter have the ability of a rapid change of genetic structure. This is an important characteristic because it allows microorganisms to escape an antimicrobial defense and develop resistance to certain drugs.\nDue to the fact that Citrobeaters can settle in human and animal tissues for long periods of time, there have appeared antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are able to migrate the body fluids for many years, causing an infection.\nWhat type of diseases are caused by these bacteria?\nIn the last decade there has observed growing concern about the health risks posed by this group of micro-organisms. We are talking about Citrobat infections, in particular, septicemia or typhoid like fever because of these microbes which leads to meningitis.\nInfection of bone and adjacent tissue in some parts of body is called osteomyelitis. If osteoarthritis develops, then the patient has to deal with pain associated, limitation of movement. Bone infections can develop at any stage of life, but in most cases they appear in small children or older people.\nThere are many diseases, accompanied by an abnormal increase in body temperature: typhoon fever, meningococcus, bacterial sepsis, leptospirosis, staphylococcal infection, endocarditis, tuberculosis, scarlet fever. Bacterial toxins or products produced by the bacteria cause a fever.\nPeritonitis is the inflammation reaction of peritoneum. Periton is a thin layer of tissue that protects abdominal organs. It is located between pericardial fat and", "Here, we take a look at 37 drugs approved to treat diseases and conditions that are caused by Citroobacter and its variants.\nThere are two main types of Citobactor infections:\nFirst, there\u2019s a normal type called Citocobater freundii, which is a type of gram-negative bacteria. It typically causes UTIs in hospitalized person\u2019s who develop catheter-associated UTI. If they become infected with the bacteria, they will typically do so from having catheters, central venous catherts, or urinary cathets in their bodies. The bacteria can also cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) in those who have a weakened immune system.\nThe second type is Citrobecker rodentium, also commonly refer to as Rodentia Enteric Colonic Pathogen bacteria.\nCommon drugs used to cure and prevent Citrodacter diseases include:\nAntibacterails\nAntimicrobials such as ceftriaxone, erythromycin, cephalexin, and diclofenac\nMacrolides such\nAmoroxil\nCeftobiprole\nIf symptoms persist, patients may also nee treatment with\nDoxycyclline\nZidovudin\nYou may know cephalosporins as antibiotics, but many people don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re actually broad-spectrum antibiotics. They are most often prescribed for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) infections. Cephalospoins are also known as \u201cbeta-lactam antibiotics.\u201d The drugs all contain the same chemical, l-cysteine. As such, the antibiotics work by inhibiting the production of a protein called \u201cprostaglandin synthesis\u201d. This enzyme is essential for the normal growth and function of many bacteria that cause UTs and other infections\nThese medicines are frequently used for treatment of UTls. These medicines include ciprofloxacin, norfuxacin. ofloxaciin and lomefloxacins..\nAmoxicillins\nThey\u2019re typically used when there isn\u2019t any other drugs that can be given right away because they are generally considered to have fewer side effects than other types. Amoxicillin is only taken once daily for about four hours per day. This is why this medicine is sometimes referred to colloquially as a \u201cpill-in-the-pill\u201d. However, as with other medicines, some people may experience allergic reactions to them. So, in order to avoid these effects", "Let's figure out the answer to these questions.\nThe genus citrobater include bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The genus is characterized by a heterogeneity of microflora in nature. Pathogenic species of this genus include C. diversus, C.freundii, and C.koseri.\nCitrobacteria are normal microorganisms of fecal and oral flora. They are capable of causing asymptomatic forms of disease as well as severe infections in the newborns of premature children.\nDiseases caused by bacteria are classified according to the age characteristics of patients: newborn and child age. Newborn infants rarely suffer from citrate infections, but infants and children of preschool age are sick with different degrees of severity of infection. This pathogenic bacteria prefer to cause intestinal infections (peritonitis, parotitis). Infection can be transmitted from feces by food and water during food processing. Citobacteria multiply in water after a long period of storage, causing the formation of biofilms on the inner surface of reservoirs and pipelines.\nPathogenicity of bacteria in humans can vary. In some patients, infections may be asymptotic in others, acute intestinal infection, septicemia or urinary tract infections develop. These factors are influenced by the nature of pathogen and sensitivity of patient immunity. For example, the frequency of serious infections increases in patients whose immunity is lowered due to HIV-infection or due the use of drugs and long-term treatment. Bacteria of citratobater are able to produce toxins and hemolysins. Under the influence of endotoxins in children and adults, there is a general intoxication with an increase in temperature, a strong headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling of soft tissues. Patients should be urgently hospitalized in a hospital.\nAntibiotic therapy of C.tetani disease and other similar infections are carried out with the appointment of a wide-spectrum antibiotic with good gastrointestinal tolerance, which can penetrate effectively into the bloodstream and tissue fluids. Antibiotics, as a rule, are selected empirically, based on age and type of antibacterial susceptibility. If there are factors that indicate an isolated resistance of some bacteria, then local antibiograms must be conducted. Based on this data, pharmacological treatment should take place.", "Infection is caused by bacteria which belongs to the genus named Citroacter.\nThe bacteria can be found in water, raw milk, or in fruits as well as vegetables.\nIt doesn\u2019t pose much of a threat when handled with appropriate care. The bacteria usually do not cause many diseases, but it is known as an opportunistic pathogen and can cause urinary tract infection and neonatal meningitis.\nWhat causes Citobacter Infections?\nCitrobacters are naturally found anywhere. They usually attach to surfaces, and when it\u2019s inhaled or ingested into the body, it becomes infectious.\nSome types of diseases are caused due to these bacteria, such as urinary-tract infection, pneumonia, meningitides, pyomyositis, blood infections, abscesses, peritonitis and a host of others.\nThere are several types and species of citrobacteria which include the following.\nCitobater freundii\u00a0 is normally a harmless inhabitant of the digestive system, where as the citobacteria divergens \u00a0is a food poisoning\u00a0causative agent.\nAnother example of this type of bacteria is the\u00a0 citroacten cloacae that\u00a0can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.\nPeople that have\u00a0 kidney injury and those with implanted cardiac devices are at higher risk of getting this disease.\nHow are citrabacteria infections spread?\nPeople can become infected with this bacteria when they breathe in the contaminated dust, air or aerosols.\nThose who swallow it accidentally can get the infection by drinking contaminated water and even food.\nThis bacteria affects mostly immunosuppressed patients who may have HIV/AIDS, diabetes, those on chemotherapy, kidney patients and have implanted medical devices in their body.\nSymptoms of Citibacter infection\nCitro bacteria infections can affect people of all ages.

Is this just growing pains and will they go away or not?\nYou are correct you should seek out help immediately. Toddlers often have growing pain which is normal. But the fact your child has pain in several different area is concerning. These should be evaluated further by a physician. While it is important to try and identify if the source of the problem is an orthopedic issue such as muscle or bone or an inflammatory or neurological problem. This evaluation will be based on your report of what your toddler is experiencing along with a more thorough physical exam by the physician.\nYou should call and schedule an appointment with your pediatricians office. If this is not possible contact a local childrens hospital and make an immediate appointment. There you can see more specialists if needed and they can better evaluate your daughter.", "He walks with an odd gait, keeps falling and can't balance very well.\nIt's really hard to be certain who to see at such a young age. Usually, when kids have difficulties as described, it would be worth checking in with your family pediatrician to get the opinion of a pediatric orthopedist. This is a specialist in treating conditions of the bones and joints in kids.\nYour concern is not uncommon when it comes to toddlers and it should not be taken too lightly. It's important that you know that your pediatricians should always be the first line of contact and help. They could help you get an idea as to what's happening, if it could be a simple problem or if additional opinions are necessary.\nFor such problems, a good pediatric general practitioner or a certified family practitioner would have the most basic knowledge to do what they need to to determine if they require additional testing or help in that area. If they do require a referral, they are likely to refer you to a specialized orthopod trained in dealing with kids and their different problems.\nThe problem here is that if you have concerns, you'd likely be seeking for someone who is specialized in the area of their need. And when you look at it from that point of view, an orthopaedist is the one that we really need help from.\nOrthopaedic surgeons are trained to deal with problems of muscle, tendon, ligaments, cartilage and all the other soft tissues. Some of them are also further trained on surgical procedures of bones, joints and musculoskeletal system and some are not. Those that have taken on further training often go on to specialize even further.\nIn such cases, an Orthopaedics specialist may refer them to another specialist - which is more commonly called a sub-specialist - who has experience either with developmental ortho problems in babies, children, adolescents and young teenagers. Or, the referral could also be to someone that can help with a neuromuscular skeletal problem, where they have more experience dealing specifically with conditions related to the muscles, bones or tissues or nerves that may cause movement disorders in young children.\nYou'll find there are a few different specialists to choose from, ranging from pediatric rheumatologists, pediatric sports medicine, spine surgeons and even pediatric neurologists who'll do specialized testing so they can determine the specifics of your child's conditions.\nThere are even other people that they recommend you go to", "Also has anyone had back surgery?\nI\u2019ve seen several doctors, and I am now under a neurologist\u2019s care. I\u2019d call his office and ask. But I\u2019ve been to the chiropractor for years.\nWhen my toddler (then a baby!) had trouble holding her head up, her pediatrician sent her to a pediatric neurosurgeon for tests and we were able to determine that that she did not have scoliosis or kyphosis nor some of the other conditions that cause that problem (we got a clean bill of health on the rest of her spine too). She\u2019s now in a wheelchair though I do not know what brought that on.\nThe pediatric chiropractors are wonderful. We use one just for regular check-ups and sometimes if I think the kids have issues with their spines, she'll come and get it a check. She is fantastic. My 12 year old has an issue with his hip. He's growing too fast and it will pass but it was getting to that \"too long of a wait\" stage. So I got the pediatric chiro to use deep therapy and massage on him daily and he is moving along much better and quickly for him so I'm happy. Best part of it all is that my son said he much prefers her than the doctors. The doctors don't have great methods to ease her pain either.\nI go and see a chiroprater for my back pain. And sometimes go after getting shots for pain in my knee. They work well for some ailments.\nDo some research online and call the Pediatricians and Neurologists offices to see if you have to pay co-pays for just an appointment or just their advice, or if after one visit they will refer you to your medical insurance companies or doctors that will then refer. It is always a good thing to check everything out before you get your information just to make sure your insurance will cover the cost if necessary. If the insurance doesn't cover costs, always consider the costs before going in. Hope this helps.\nMy 10 month old would just sit on my bed and cry. His legs were really stiff, too.

{"Question": "Is dementia inherited? Can one develop dementia without inheriting it?\n", "Free_form_answer": "Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.\n 1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact. 2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2).\n\t\t\t\t", "Must_have": ["Alzheimer's disease, one form of dementia, is influenced by both risk genes and deterministic genes.", "Risk genes, such as apolipoprotein E-e4, increase the likelihood of developing the disease but do not guarantee it.", "Deterministic genes, including those coding for the proteins APP, PS-1, and PS-2, directly cause the disease and guarantee its development in those who inherit them.", "Inheritance of these genes only accounts for a fraction of Alzheimer's cases, however, and most dementia cases are not direct outcomes of genetics."], "Nice_to_have": ["Factors like lifestyle, age, and overall health can also contribute to the development of dementia.", "It's also worth noting that while genes can influence whether a person might develop Alzheimer's, they're not the sole factor.", "Non-genetic factors, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension, have also been associated with an increased risk of dementia."], "sample_predictions": ["Is dementia hereditary?? Can dementia be inherited?\nDementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common type of dementia. It is not a normal part of aging. The risk of Alzheimer's disease increases with age, but it is rare in people under age 60. In the United States, about 1 in 10 people age over 65 have Alzheimer disease. By age of 85, the rate increases to 30 percent. Dementia can also be caused by other conditions, such as stroke, Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\nDementias are often progressive, meaning symptoms start slowly and gradually worsen. However, there are some dementing illnesses that are not progressive. For example, some people with Alzheimer dementia may have a rapid onset of symptoms and then stabilize for years. Other dimentias, like Creuzfeld-Jacob disease, are rapidly progressive and fatal.\nThe cause of most dements is unknown. Some dents are caused or worsened by vascular disease (stroke), head injury, or other medical conditions. There are also some genetic causes of dementia. These are rare, and most cases of the common demente, Alzheimer, have no known cause.\nAlzheimer\u2019s is caused in part by a buildup of a protein called amyloid in the brain. This protein is also found in other parts of our bodies, including our blood. Scientists are studying whether amyloids in blood can be used to predict who will develop Alzheimer. They are looking at whether the amyoid in our brains is inherited. If so, it may be possible to screen for the gene that causes Alzheimer and prevent it.\nThere are several genes that have been linked to Alzheimer in some families. One of these genes is called APOE. A person with two copies of this gene has a 20 percent chance of developing Alzheimer by age sixty. People with one copy of APE have an 8 percent risk. Those with no copies have only a one percent lifetime risk.\nOther genes have also been found to cause Alzheimer or increase the risk for it. But these are very rare. Most cases are due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.", "Are there other reasons you would need to see a GP for a dementia assessment?\nThis book is for people being assessed for dementia and their families.

To get other formats ask at the library for 'Dementia: The journey through diagnosis to end of life, 2018, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Social Care Institute of Excellence -SCIE'.\nIn this fact sheet we explore the answers to these questions.\nThere is growing recognition that more people with dementia are living in nursing homes, residential or care homes. In 2001, more than half (59%) of people living with the condition were known to live independently. More recently, figures reveal these are reducing, and in 2105 the numbers of those living independently were found to be 39%. A further 5% were living alone in sheltered accommodation. The remaining 50% of patients were in some form of care or nursing home.\nWhy does my relative have dementia?\nAlthough the reasons for this are not always clear, it could be that you are at greater risk of picking up dementia through an unhealthy lifestyle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to look closely at your living habits as the main risk factors that can contribute to both vascular and Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nThe early stages of dementia can be distressing for relatives as it takes a long time to adjust to the new reality, you may have to accept changes such as driving the car, shopping alone, caring for the home and pets.

How is the chance of developing dementia by inhereting it from the parents or grandparents?\nHow likely are dementia-related diseases to be hereditary?", "Is dementia inheritance is possible?\nI will answer this two questions together because they are interconnected in one way. Yes, dementia is inheritable, but not necessarily. One can develop without inheritance. How do you know if you develop it by hereditary factors or you have developed it from other factors that are not inherited in the family? This will be the case if a dementia patient does not develop before 80 years.\nAlzheimer's disease, which is responsible for most cases of dementia, is characterized by cognitive deterioration occurring in all age groups. However, symptoms of Alzheimer's can be present for more than 15 years before they become apparent. This is known as early onset Alzheimer. People between the age of 40 and 60 can show symptoms that may indicate the onset of AD, in this case, there is the possibility that this disease is inherited from one generation to the other. In this scenario, it is clear that dementia can occur hereditarily in families.\nHowever, most of the cases are observed in individuals who cross at least 65 years of age, and dementia in such cases can happen due to several factors. Sometimes this can also happen after a trauma. But in most such instances, this is not observed to be heritable.\nA 2013 study showed that 50% of patients with early AD can inherit this AD because of mutation in some specific genes. These genes are APP, PSEN1 and TREN2. Therefore, if one person of family has early dementia before the 8th decade of life, then there can exist Alzheimer gene in family.\nIn a normal family, 5 to 10% can have dementia due Alzheimer before their 90th year of their life. Some studies showed this figure to as high as 13%.\nAs far as inheritance of Dementia is concerned, the symptoms in each case can vary widely. The degree and speed of symptoms also differs from person to person. There are many cases where a person can function independently and can work for several more years, although he/she can suffer from memory loss.\nOn the flipside, some patients tend to lose their motor functions in addition to cognitive functions much more effectively.

It is caused by a blockage of the airway. This can be caused either by the tongue falling back and blocking the throat or by enlarged tonsils and adenoids. The most common symptom is snoring. Other symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, and difficulty concentrating. Sleep apneoa can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, depression, anxiety, memory problems, weight gain, impotence, irritability, mood swings, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, headaches and other health problems. If you have any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment plan. There are several treatments available for sleep Apnea. One of them is called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). This involves wearing a mask over your nose and mouth while you sleep, which forces air into your lungs. Another option is to use a device called a mandibular advancement device (MAD). It works by moving your lower jaw forward, opening up your airways. A third option involves surgery. Surgery is usually recommended for people who have severe sleep disorders. However, it is not always necessary. In fact, many people with mild to moderate sleep problems do not need surgery.\nWhat are the symptoms of sleep disorder?\nSleep disorders are conditions that affect the quality of your sleep and cause problems during the day. They include insomnia, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, sleepwalking, night terrors, snore, apneas, bruxism, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, nocturnal enuresis, parasomnias, periodic limb movement disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder and sleep paralysis. Symptoms of a sleep problem include difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently during nighttime hours, feeling tired throughout the morning, daytime drowsiness and fatigue. People who suffer from sleep disturbances often experience problems concentrating, remembering things, making decisions, performing tasks, driving safely, working effectively, socializing, exercising, eating properly, maintaining relationships, getting along with others, being productive, enjoying life, having fun, staying healthy, living longer, achieving goals, accomplishing dreams, fulfilling potential, finding meaning in life and feeling happy.\nHow is the sleep study done?\nA sleep test is performed to determine whether you are", "The answer to the first question is that sleep disordered breathing is a term that encompasses different conditions where sleep is interrupted by blockage of the airways. Sleep Apnea also consists of Obstructive Sleep Disordered Breathing (OSDB) and is the most common form. In Obstruction Sleep Disorder Breeding (OSSB) the upper airway becomes blocked and you stop breathing which can lead to poor sleep and daytime sleepiness.\nTreatment is based on the type of disorer that is impacting you. Depending on whether you are diagnosed with OSSD or OSSB treatment can be administered including lifestyle changes, surgery, or using a c-pap machine to aid breathing during sleep. The c-Pap is an alternative to surgery.\nThere are several tests performed to make a diagnosis of sleep disorder and then determining the severity. An overnight sleep study is performed along with a physical examination and screening of blood oxygen levels. Surgery is recommended by the surgeon as your alternative treatment option. If you do have OSSDD, the surgery will not cure that and the cPAP machine will still be used.\nFor OSSA, there are also tests used to accurately diagnose. This type includes a thorough examination, a blood test, and a CT scan. There are non-surgical solutions, such as changing bed position, but the best method is to determine if your upper or lower jaw has a problem. A laser ablation may be performed if it is your lower air passage causing the problem, which is treated by performing surgery on your tongue, along the side of your jaw, throat, nasal passage or under the tongue.\nIf it\u2019s your nasal air passages are causing problems the procedure is called turbinate debridement. For severe cases, an endoscopic sinus surgery can change the shape of a block such a deviated septum. Some cases may require you to wear a nasal spray on a regular basis or having the area cauterized by laser.", "This is what these patients, who shared their personal success stories with us, have to say.\nSleep apnoea is a serious medical disorder in which a person temporarily stops breathing during sleep.\nIf not treated properly, such pauses in breathing can increase a patient\u2019s risk of heart attack and stroke. For patients who suffer from severe sleep-disordered breathing with significant daytime sleepiness, weight loss, sleep hygiene and position therapy including mandibular splint positioning treatment can be very helpful. But many times it is not enough and surgery proves to be the definitive treatment.\nDr. Ramakrishnan Gopalswamy, Director & Chief Consultant Otorhinolaryngology & ENT, CK Birla Hospitals, is one of India\u2019s most experienced ENT experts with more than 25 years of practice. He uses the most advanced treatments and procedures at the state-of-the-art CK Hospitals in Kolkata, which is spread across six floors and contains everything that a medical practitioner could ever dream of. The hospital boasts of two fully functional theatres and 9 OPDs where he conducts his treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders (OSA), snoring, allergy, ear ENT diseases and sinus problems. His expertise in this field is unparalleled and for anyone suffering from OSA, the best way to treat the symptoms is with CPAP.\nCPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the first-line of treatment for patients suffering OAS & snorer. While CPAN is very effective in most situations, CPAB is only required to manage the severity of the condition.\nBut at times, even CPBN proves ineffective in alleviating the patient of his condition or improves the quality of their sleep. In such situations and cases, where the anatomy is abnormal and where CPNN is ineffective, patients have no choice but to undergo a more direct treatment: surgery.\nSurgery is generally recommended to patients when they are unable to cope with their symptoms which can have dangerous consequences. Snoring can disturb sleep patterns and make the snorers tired during the day while obstructive sleep disorders can affect daily living routines of such patients. It is quite common for such sleep disorder patients to wake up gasping for breath during their slumber. This can lead to a variety of health conditions such as, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and more seriously - sudden cardiac death. Patients who undergo sleep surgery have an overall quality improvement in their life, feel better, more awake during day time (alertness", "Dr. Michael Helmy explains.\nWhat will our procedure do to help those suffering from obstructive sleep?\nAre the benefits of dental implants the same for both upper and lower jaw?\nHow is the dental implant process done?", "These are important questions for anyone who suffers from this condition. If you are looking for sleep solutions in Louisville, you may have considered sleep surgery as a treatment option. To help you better understand just how successful these procedures are, here are a couple of facts that you should be aware of:\n\u2022 Approximately 37 million American adults suffer from obstructive sleep Apnea (OSA).\n\u2022 85% of people who are diagnosed with this sleeping problem suffer a few, or a high number of, complications due to it each year.\n\u2022 Up to half of the population affected by OSA go undiagnosed.\nSleep Apneia: Is There a Cure?\nSleep apneic is a condition that may sometimes require surgery; however, there are other options which can be effective at treating patients who suffer more mildly. In severe cases, however surgery is one of only a very few options available so it is important to know what to expect from sleep surgeries such as:\nNasal Surgery Sleep apneas such nasal obstruction, deviated septum, and enlarged turbinate can cause OAS. However, many of these conditions are easy to treat and can often be corrected through non-surgical means. For those patients whose conditions cannot be treated using more mild, non-invasive methods of correction, nasal surgery has proven effective in relieving the pressure on patients\u2019 airways and reducing the risk of future sleep disorder problems.\nAdenoid Removal and Tonsillectomy Some patients with Osa suffer as result of enlarged tonsils and adenoids which are present due, in part, to inflammation and allergies. When these grow inflamed and large enough, the result is an impediment to airflow in the throat and trachea. This in turn, can block the patient\u2019s ability to breath while they are asleep, making it near impossible for them to receive a full nights rest. Removal of this tissue will often result in restored ability for the sufferer to be able to sleep unimpeded.\nOral Appliance Therapy and Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Masks and appliances are another common form of treatment for those who have Oa and snoring disorders. The oral device works by moving or holding the jaw in a position which allows the airway to remain open while the person sleeps. Many patients find great comfort in using oral appliances because they do not require cumbersome masks such asthe one needed for CPAP therapy. Although many patients have found this treatment to work very well,", "Here is some information from an expert to help.\nSleep apnoea, also referred to as obstructive sleep breathing disorder, is a condition in which the person affected experiences cessation of airflow during sleep due to complete or partial collapse of the upper airway. This condition results in repeated pauses in breathing while a person sleeps. These pauses are called apneas (plural of apnoc), which last typically greater than 10 seconds in length. A normal healthy person has up to 15 apneic periods in 5 minutes every now and then. However, a sleep disorder is diagnosed when this rate exceeds 1 or more apnceas in a 3 minute period. In the United States of America, this condition affects approximately 9% of women and 24% men aged 30 to50 years. It is important to make a diagnosis and treat the patient properly because this sleep condition is associated with increased risk of heart disease, type2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke and motor vehicle accidents.\nThe first line of treatment consists of either changing position while sleeping (sleeping on the side as opposed to sleeping on your back as it is more prone to aponeas) or wearing a mandibular advancement devices to prevent the collapse. CPAP therapy is the second line treatment wherein a machine with a tight fitting mask is given to the sleep patient. He/she is required to wear this tightfitting mask at night while he breaths air at positive pressure. Third line therapy consists primarily of undergoing surgical procedure to remove the obstruction.

If the patient develops such complaints, then, you must discontinue a mlodpine, not the A Ten.\nThe pulse can be monitored when the doctor checks up and if symptoms of a slower beat develop, a ten may be substituted by a calcium channel blocker more gradually, preferably over a period of 2 weeks or more.\nDrugs Affecting the Digestive System,\u00a0\u00a0 Fetal Development,, Angina,\u00a0 Acl, Fainting,", "Is there a danger of developing hypertension by doing this?\nThe short answer, of course, is that I have no way of knowing because I did not write your ACGME accreditation statement.

A patient should be tapered off amliodipene, before taking atenol or any other b blocking agent. If b blockers are started without a gradual taper, adverse effects such as fatigue, decreased blood pressure, nausea, dizziness and increased risk of depression can occur.

This is because the disease in older people is dangerous \u2013 some even require long-term care.\nIt is estimated that around one in ten shingling people will experience a reactivation of the herpes zoster virus in their childhood (chicken pox) in old age.\nThis causes the characteristic painful blisters with a scar tissue that forms for months and years.\nThe herpes virus usually hibernates until puberty, and then usually remains latent, not attacking the body and not spreading to other people. Only if the immune system is weakened do herpes viruses \u2013 like the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can be transmitted sexually, or HIV, for example, \u2013 cause disease. The immune response in adolescence and young adulthood is considered the most important factor influencing the age of re-activation. In Germany, 95% of boys and girls have been infected with the chickenpox virus by adolescence; in Western countries, about once in three people with chicken poxs gets shings. A vaccination against chicken pus is not part of childhood immunization in any country, mainly because it is generally assumed to be a harmless mild disease, particularly in comparison with diseases against which vaccination is widespread. Yet the virus can reactivate at any time. However, it almost never causes shinging if it leaves the baby\u2019s body within the first month of life. If it occurs, there will be fever, skin rash and malaise. While the older a person becomes, one is more likely to experience more severe symptoms: 50% by age 30; 70% to 80% if age at 60 years; and 90% at age over 65 years at the onset of disease.\nIn addition to the risk of shimsles, a weakened immune defence is especially dangerous at a time in life when people are most vulnerable to a whole range of common infections. These include those transmitted by infected people, such as tuberculosis and varicella, as well as gastrointestinal illnesses, especially salmonella and campylobacter infections, which cause many cases of serious diarrhoea in adults.

Such consanguinity is one of the numerous factors that could potentially contribute to the condition, and the individual risk is influenced by many factors including the specifics of the family's genetic makeup.Long-term pulmonary sequelae are possible, as untreated CDH can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, and potentially longer-term lung function abnormalities.

CD causes breathing problems because the intestines and other organs are actually in the chest, rather than in their normal positions in abdomen. So, the lungs are compressed, or collapsed.\nThere has been very little research done to predict the outcome of an infant born to mother that had a CD. This is for the main reason that very few women with this disorder actually end up having children.\nWhat type of outcome the baby will have depends on a number of factors.\nMost important, if the CD occurs on the right side, there is a greater chance that the newborn could die within the first few hours of of life than with the left-side CD hernias.

However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase.

Shingles happens when the virus that causes chicken-pox remains dormant within the body after a person has had chicken - po - and is later activated by a change in your immune system. The virus is not communicable in any way after chicken-box has been successfully fought by the immune systems. No special measures are needed to prevent the transmission of shingl es.", "As a health educator I have a duty to educate my co-workers and the employees of a local restaurant about shingle variecs and any other health-related topics. My concern in this case involved the transmission of herpes zoster. Although these viruses do not cause a direct infection in those who are immunosuppressed, they can be very dangerous. They have the potential to transmit a severe viral infection and result in serious consequences.\nShingles, herpes simplex, and cold sores are all caused by similar viruses that infect the same site. All of these viral infections occur either spontaneously or in response to a stressor that has caused damage to the immune system. Symptoms in common are tingling, pain, blisters, fevers, muscle aches, fatigue, anxiety, depression, poor coordination, vision problems, headache, nausea, sore throat, cough, diarrhea or gas. In addition, the symptoms will most often be mild, lasting maybe just a few days, although sometimes they will only be severe or long lasting, depending on the person\u2019s age, immune status, nutritional status and so on.\nAn individual who is exposed to one of the aforementioned viruses can come in contact with a virus by coming in direct contact (directly or indirectly) with an infected person. It is not known if or how often an uninfected person can become infected through the use of \u201chazards\u201d; however, if the infected individual has a good level of immunity, he or she may experience only minor symptoms or no symptoms at all. If the level is very low however or if this person has not been vaccinated against all of his or her viruses (including herpes), the individual can die from a simple shinges virus infection.\nThe shingler outbreak has also been related to unclean hands and other body parts, such as genital areas. Contamination from the body\u2019s own immune cells, even the ones that lie deep within the skin, is thought to cause this condition. Researchers are hopeful that they may eventually learn how to safely prevent shinge outbreaks. For now, those at risk are advised to keep close watch on their symptoms and report any changes to their health care providers.\nAnother possible cause of shinches outbreaks is foodborne illness due to salmonella, which has been growing in popularity in recent years.

If you have any of these symptoms after being shocked, you should seek medical attention right once.\nElectrocution is a type of injury caused by electric shock. It can be caused in a number of ways, but the most common is by touching a source of electricity, such as a wire or a plug. Electrocutions can also be fatal if the person is not wearing protective clothing or if they are not aware of the danger.\nCan you be killed by plugging in an appliance?\nThe most frequent cause of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities is electrical injury. The most prevalent ECG abnormalities are ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion, which are both caused to the heart\u2019s electrical system. These abnormalities can lead to arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeat, as well as other heart problems.\nThe majority of people who are shocked do not die. However, if you do die, it is most likely because of a heart attack or stroke.

Ect is also used in the treatment of other mental health disorders, like as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. There are a few symptoms that you may experience after receiving ETC.

I could do nothing for about 10 minutes after I was shocked but, then I finally coughed and spat it out. That was one huge shock, they said that I can't do heavy workout or anything like that. After that my throat muscles were not the same. Just imagine that an electric shock goes through your throat as well like through the whole organism.

It made an electric shock but not too bad. I also think it had been hit on one of the two wires that was on the middle of it. But it wasn't anything bad and there wasn\u2019t\u2019 even an outlet (it was a soccer game). Afterwards I noticed I had trouble swallowing the next day and still now (3 days later). I just wanted to see if what happened was bad or not. Does this type of shock causes this.?\nA football goal post is not an object that ordinarily has high voltages (i.e. dangerous electrical currents) running through it\nSwallowing difficulties are most often caused by physical diseases such as heart valve defects and esophageal motility disorders (which affect the ability to swallow) rather than by electricity\nAlthough electrical shocks are often associated with injuries and pain, the type and extent of injuries are not strictly dictated by the amount of electrochemical energy present.\nAn electrical current produces a large variety of symptoms depending on:\nits voltage or the strength of its electric field\nits frequency (how many times it cycles in a single second)\nhow its conductors (e.g. the hands) are holding on to it.\nthe location and type or nature of electric contact with the body\nthe temperature of body tissues.\nIf the current travels through muscle tissue and not neural tissue (tissue of nerves), the muscles will cramp, contract and go into spasms. The muscles can be forced to contract so forcefully that they break (like some of us do on a regular basis when playing sports\u2026ouch! :)). If a high level of electrical energy passes through the heart, it could cause the electrical impulses in the brain to malfunction and cause cardiac arrest.\nThe degree and severity of pain are unpredictable. Some very high currents make very little noise (a crackling or buzzing sound) and produce virtually undetectable pain in some subjects. In this regard, pain is one sensation of injury that is subject to a subjective, psychological interpretation. For example, a small, low current, direct contact electric current to the head may leave the person not feeling any pain and no outward signs of damage, but after a mental examination by a trained physician, there may be irreversible brain damage due to that electric energy.", "Can a electrical shock (High voltage) cause long term problems. such as difficulty in swallowing and hoarseness?\nWhat causes difficulty swallowing?\nThis is also referred to as dysphasia or dysphonasia.

On blini, they are always served with a dollop of sour cream, and sometimes a slice of lemon or a spoonful of red or black cavier is thrown in as garnish.

For the most part, however, it does not appear in that country's cuisine much, probably because it has a less prominent flavor than other fish oils or fish liver oils.\nOther cove ingredients include cumin, capers, bay leaves, dill, olive oil, tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, pepper and wine for flavoring; olive leaf, tarragon, papakka, basil and leeks for color; and spices", "Can calcitinon salmon be left at room temperature for 45 minutes\n?

They occur when one vertebra in my middle back protrudes into the disc between that one and the one below it.\nThere is no reason I know of - just an abnormality. Like you ask is it causing problems, it may, but not likely. Is there pain? If the pain is in your back and radiates down the back of your legs, that's another possibility. My father had degenerative disc disease which resulted in him needing a disk replaced in his back. The pain can radiate down to your butt. Any chance you've had back problems in that area of the spine, before? Could be a sign of degeneration of that part of spine.\nWhat's a Schmonrl's node?\nThere's no cure. Treatment involves some kind of anti-inflammatory pain killer. If pain persists, you may undergo a fusion. That just means they basically remove the middle section of two vertabrea and attach them together by a rod.\nThe vertabrae just protrude into your disk, meaning you have more than the usual \"hole\" for the nerves in between the vertbrae. This can be cause the nerve to protruide further than usual, causing some of what you describe.\nMy father didn't have any pain until one day he couldn't go to work because his whole back was in pain, all the way to his butt cheeks! He did a bunch of physical therapy which he said helped quite a bit. He needed surgery to relieve the pressure on the the disks. Hope this helps. Let's all hope it's not a hereditary condition.\nAre your Schmoorl nodes just \"holes\" or are they a protrusion? The latter sounds similar to a \"slipped disc\".

To find out more, or to talk to a specialist at the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association of America (SBHAA), visit the Healthline. How are Schmoral's Node detected? Schmore's node are detected by: X-ray : This procedure produces images of your X-rays. The X ray are passed through your body and detect the soft tissues in your bone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) : Magnetic field, as well as radio waves, creates pictures of the inside of body. When they are joined, MRI images are detailed in the X rays of brain, muscles, tendons, and other internal organs. Computer tomography (CT) scans : CT scans are created when Xrays at many angles produce a detailed cross sectional picture of internal structures. Schmoer's Nodes is sometimes known as Herniated discs. But what is disc herniation? Herniation occurs when a part of disc moves from its place in vertebra. This occurs in spine, when vertebare are separated one from other by intervertebral discs, which are soft and round. These are actually cushions located between two vertberare. Hernia causes pain in neck or pain that radiates to arms and legs.It may or may not be accompanied by nerve weakness. As disc's move, they pinch the nerve. Discs move because they can become weakened or are exposed to excess strain. There are various possible cause for back pain. Some of them are not serious and may cure within few days. Many causes are related to injuries, such as strains, sprains or back trauma. Sometimes people may develop back problems at age, due to degenerative disease like osteoporosis. However some causes can develop into a serious medical condition and require urgent treatment, like infection, tumors, fractures. Back pain due herniated disk may get severe enough to radiate to one or both legs or arms, cause tingling or numbness in legs to the point, where you can't control them and cause weakness in muscles. In such cases doctor can diagnose hernia by physical examination and testing, by the following techniques: Physical examination : Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your back and leg for any abnormal movements, swelling or tenderness. He /she will also examine sensitivity by touching certain areas. While you are lying face down on the table,", "I have three and need to be checked by a ortho or rheumatologist.\nSchmorlz nodes are the name given to small bony spur formations on the disc, visible in MRI's. They could indicate a ruptured disc. The name derives from a German Doctor who first described the condition and should not be confused with schmorls node syndrome.", "?\nSchmorls nodes are degeneration of the nucleus pulposis with the vertebral body and have been described as herniations of this nucleus into the marrow.\nI would like more information please. A MRI of my lower spine was taken about three months ago. The spine has had many problems and I have had five operations on my back and abdomen. My MRI said Schmolls nodes were found in my L1,L2 and L3 vertabrae. I think I only have one more question; I read on another site that \"they are small cyst-like structures that occur on the bony ends of each vertebra. Schmoorl\u2019s nodes occur in the lower half of most people\u2019s spines and they often remain there throughout a person\u2019s entire life without ever developing into osteophytes.\" What does that mean? How many do you get? Where do all these boney cysts end up? And when they do not develop into a spurring or osteohyte, what do they become and why did they appear? I would say that I am not a \"normal\" person cause I hurt and pain every day and feel every joint, muscle, bone and organ in your body. Thanks a ton, you are very caring and do so much for people!\nSchmort's Nodes\nThey are areas where bone grows into an area of degenerative disc disease causing the disc to bulge into that area. It is usually a result of trauma and most commonly seen in young athletes. When they are found within the subchondral bone where the growths are located it is called a sub-chondoral insufficiency fracture.", "I had one that I did not want to be cut out even though it was quite large, like a big hole.\nSchmorls nodes are depressions on the bone in the spinal discs that look like tiny herniations. Schmorphs nodes can exist with mild back pain symptoms. But, at times. they can lead to spinal stenosis and spinal issues. As a chiropractor, we can relieve symptoms without having to have surgery. You are lucky to live in an age of the internet. There is information by the thousands on any topic you would want. It would be a good idea to do background reading on spinal health. Best Regards.\nThere are probably all sorts of reasons. One might be that in some people the bony ring around the discs is less dense than it is in others, so the disc has more of a \"give\" -- it has a greater ability to absorb force.\nThis greater capacity for absorbing stresses is why discs are found between the vertebrae in humans and other vertebrates. By acting as shock absorbers, they prevent the impact of walking, running, and jumping from being transferred straight-up to the nervous system.\nAs your spine is loaded -- while you are bending to pick up a book, say -- the stress will be distributed to a number of levels, not absorbed fully by just one or two. Also, a Schmoral node is not a herniated disc where the internal nucleus pulposis presses out through the tough outer annulus.\nIt's kind of like when, as a child, I used to break sticks over my knee to get them into thin enough pieces to use as straws. The break would occur at the spot of maximum stress, where I was leaning down on my thigh. Where the forces are being applied, the weakest point will break, or be stressed the most.\nSo in any given person, discs at different points in their spine will experience more stress when doing certain activities. This is where you can get the \"back pain\" when something is out of alignment with your body center of gravity.\nYes it\u2019s true you have a \u201chole\u201d in your Lumbar spine called a schmorrls node.

Insomnia can have many causes, including stress, anxiety, and depression.\n-Narcolepsy: Narcoleptics experience sudden and uncontrollable sleepiness during the day. They may also experience cataplexy, which is sudden muscle weakness or paralysis.\n-Obstructive sleep apnea: Obstructed sleep Apnea is when the airway becomes blocked during sleep, causing the sleeper to stop breathing for short periods of time.

Sometimes, medications may help as well.", "It is a phenomenon most of us have heard about, but what causes it? What triggers this state of paralysis? If you have ever felt like a \u201cghost haunting you\u201d in the middle of the night, chances are it was actually sleep \u201cparalysis.\u201d\nThere is nothing supernatural or paranormal about sleep\u00a0paralyzes. It results from a disorder of REM sleep cycle.\u00a0\nWhat causes sleep Paralysis?\u00a0\nAs a sleep disorder, sleep paralyzation occurs when you wake up before completing the entire sleep process. Sleep paralysis is associated with narcolepsy, which is why the symptoms of sleepiness\u00a0and other symptoms\u00a0usually accompany it. This condition can last for a few seconds or even minutes.\nSleep paralysis usually lasts until the muscles relax and you can move your body. While sleep can be frightening and frightening, the process itself is not considered dangerous. When it accompanies other sleep disorders, such as narcolipsey, it can cause drowsiness during the day and sleep disturbances at night that negatively affect your quality of life.\u00a0Sleep paralyses, on the other hand, is the involuntary lack of muscle activity, especially in case of involuntary movement that could interfere with sleep. According to the International Classification of Sleep disorders 3 (ICSD-3), sleep, paralysis can occur in people between the ages of 18 and 25 years.\nWhat Is The Process Of Sleep?\nSleep is an essential part of a person\u2019s quality life, as it plays an important role in mental and physical health. During sleep at least six stages are involved. These include sleep onset, light sleep (REM or non-REM), deep sleep or slow-wave sleep and REM or dream sleep.\nHow It Feels To Experience Sleep Paralisis?\u00a0\u00a0\nSleep, paralyze is characterized by a sense of \u201cweightlessness\u201d, while the sensation of not being able to move their limbs or breathe normally is considered \u201cphysiological paralysis.\u201d\nWhat Causes Sleep\u00a0Paralysis and How Does It Happen? \u2013 Sleep, Sleep Cycle, Paralyzers\nIn the case that Sleep parasyse is accompanied by hallucination, most people have no control over them, and this is where they describe their most distressing experience. In sleep,\u00a0it feels as if a stranger, ghost or scary monster is sitting on their chest or shoulders and trying to attack them at all costs.\nThis state is also called \u201cNight Terrors\u201d due to this reason. Sometimes a strange voice or a strong smell", "Sleep paralysis was observed around the globe among different societies. Many cultures have been using the term sleep or night terrors to explain the condition. It is a condition where the patient is awake and yet they\u2019re not feeling the sensation of movement. They are also not able to open their eyes or move a muscle.\nSleep Paralysis Symptoms & Causes\nIn some cases, they also hear sounds or have visions where they see an unseen creature. Sleep Paralis is usually brought about by some brain condition and it could be a part of a wider condition called Narcolepsy. The condition leads to sudden muscle relaxation where you\u2019ll be unable to move for some time.\nCauses of sleep deprivation include: sleeping conditions, stress, excessive work, and a number of health conditions. In fact, narcoleptics usually have sleep paralisis episodes when they don\u2019t get sufficient sleep. Another reason most people suffer sleep problems during daytime sleeps or naps is because they usually fall asleep quickly. Falling asleep instantly means you have an increased chance of having sleep issues like hallucinations and paralysis. When sleep is interrupted in the form of the above symptoms, it makes it tough to continue with your day to day activities. You may experience severe fatigue during the day and have difficulty concentrating, in addition to headaches and other symptoms.\nTypes Of Sleep\nSome patients suffer sleeping problems if they have a poor diet, consume too much tea and coffee, or don't exercise enough. So if you\u2019ve been suffering similar kind of episodes of sleeping paralysis, you should consult your physician immediately. Your physician will then ask you to take a few tests in order to determine the causes of your symptoms. Some of these tests include blood tests and brain scans. Brain scans show if there is any problem with the areas of our brain that regulate our sleep patterns.\nThere are other ways of preventing sleeping disorders like narcolaplis. Narcolypsis is an extremely rare sleep disorder that makes you feel groggy throughout the evening. This affects both your sleep and wakefulness cycles. If you go in for regular exercises and stick to a nutritious diet and avoid stressful situations, then you can successfully prevent this sleeping problem from recurring.\nNarcolypsia is another type of disorder affecting the upper neck muscles. These muscles get weak during sleep because of lack of exercise. Hence, a person who has narcoletics tends to experience excessive sleepiness during his daily activities.\nPeople with narcololecto suffer from excessive sleeping even after a night", "Here\u2019s the answer.\nIt\u2019s scary feeling. You think you\u2019re sound asleep, like everyone else, but this time you think is slightly different. This time, you can\u2019t move. And you know, deep down, that you are not about to wake up. Nothing is going right. Something is very wrong. There are also other things about your senses that feel off. Your legs don\u2019t want to move, your eyes don't want open- you just want this feeling to end. But the feeling doesn\u2019t leave you until you're fully awake.\nThat is the definition of sleep apnea.\nWhat Is Sleep Apnea and What Does It Feel like\nThis is one of those strange medical conditions that people experience rarely, and don\u2019 know it can be fixed simply.\nThe first and most common symptoms of it, according to an article by Healthline are feeling that your body is paralyzed, struggling to breathe, or being suffocated. It could be a combination of two of these, as well.\nIf your partner has a similar nightmare, it\u2019s possible they are experiencing sleepwalking or sleeping on the bed edge at night.\nIf you have sleep issues, there is a chance that something is wrong with your sleeping patterns because people who sleep too little are likely to have higher risks of being diagnosed with this problem (1). Additionally, people with mental issues like anxiety and depression tend to suffer more than others.\nSleep apnoea often doesn't happen by itself; it's linked to other diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, narcolepsy, brain damage after stroke or head injury and heart disease.\nThese are just some of the symptoms that can happen to someone suffering from sleep breathing disorder.\nThere are other signs too, including restless leg syndrome, sleep disordered breathing, obstructed airways, snoring, restless legs, increased saliva production, difficulty sleeping, waking after two to three hours of nighttime sleep, night terrors, frequent nightmares or trouble sleeping through the entire night.\nHowever, the only way to find out if you or someone has Sleep apenea is through a sleep study, also called polysome graphs monitoring (PSG) testing. A doctor might recommend this test if he or she thinks that the patient doesn' t sleep well enough and needs help sleeping more peacefully at some point in his or life such as after the pregnancy. The PSG records brain waves, heart rate, breathing pattern,", "Learn what causes sleep panic attacks and other related conditions.\nIf you\u2019ve ever had an out-of-body experience (OBE) while falling asleep, you may have what is called \u201csleep paralysis.\u201d This condition is where people wake up with a sense of being trapped inside their own bodies and may not be able to move or speak. It feels like you are watching everything happen, but you\u2019re unable to act.\nYou may even experience hallucinations of evil entities like demons, ghosts, or evil spirits. Sleep paralysis is much more common than most realize, so let\u2019s learn how this happens to people!\nWe\u2019ll also go over what you can do to treat it before going into depth with this mysterious condition.\nWhat Causes Sleep Paralysis?\nAlthough sleep paralyses has many different causes, the most common is one\u2019s sleep cycle. Normally people fall into a dreaming state as they sleep and wake from this dream when they feel like they should be awake but still have an awareness of what they were dreaming.\nThe problem that plagues people who experience sleep disorientation is that their dreaming process continues even after waking up which means that they may feel trapped, out of body, and have trouble moving around.\nThis is extremely scary for many people because it usually occurs right before they fall asleep when their conscious mind knows that this does not make any sense.\nSymptoms of Sleep Panic Attack\nWhen a person suffers from sleep disorder, they typically wake feeling restless and agitated. The typical symptoms include feelings of intense anxiety, palpitations, shortness of breath, a racing heart, sweating excessive, shivering or trembling and the feeling of choking.\nThese can occur as frequently as once every few seconds to hourly. There are many reasons that people suffer from episodes where feeling \u201ctoo awake,\u201d when in fact they are not aware of it and this is what we call \u201cparalysis.\u201d The cause for this sleep related incident needs exploration. However, there are several studies that look into this phenomenon and are coming up empty handed on a cause.\nHowever, most sleep experts agree that sleep is a process by which your brain goes through various states. One of these states is dreaming where you have the ability to be aware. Another state is when you sleep deeply enough, your body stops working and you physically cannot move.\nMost of the time when people experience \u201cstumbling\u201d they will realize they haven\u2019t been moving their body correctly and correct this. This is an important point because most people associate paralysis with being unable or unm", "Does the human body have the power to stop and completely immobilize itself?\nAlthough this is a question on everybody\u2019s mind, however, there is still confusion about what really happens inside a person\u2019s body when they suffer from sleep or paralysis.\nWhat Exactly Is Sleep Paralysis?\nThis usually happens when the person is sleeping and is not supposed to have any control over their body, especially what their physical reaction is supposed in that position, but it happens in the sense that they will be able to move or control.\nSleep paralysis is the inability to control some of your body. This can be the case in which you cannot move your limbs or your head during sleep.\nPeople who feel like they can feel their breathing being tightened while staying in bed and having a dream, and unable to be woken up, they start to lose consciousness, have a hard time controlling their behavior for a while.\nThere is actually no way to predict when you will experience sleep, or to prevent it in any way.\nIt is usually believed that sleep occurs during the transition of phases during REM and non-REM sleep. Since sleep is considered to occur when a brain is about to return to a waking or non-dream state.\nThis particular feeling during your sleep creates a feeling of panic, fear, terror, even the feeling that evil spirits or demons have been able in control your consciousness and body as you try to find a way out of this feeling, many of you don\u2019t realize the true cause of these episodes.\nThe true purpose of the sleep\nThe most difficult part here is that, the more you go to bed to sleep and the mind starts to accept sleep as a natural activity, it will become even more difficult to try.\nWith that being said, for those who have not experienced this kind of feeling are unlikely to feel the fear of such a thing again.\nIn some cases, sleep can cause pain due to being unable during some other activities, such as the desire to walk to the bathroom to relieve or because of pain in their legs.\nHow Does Sleep Affect The Body Physically?\nMany people think they are stuck or paralyzed, this can lead to more serious problems because it has been noted that some people are known to die in these sleep states due from the lack of oxygen and other related issues.\nA person who experiences sleep will have their entire body immobilized while at the same time their brain will not be aware of what is happening around them.\nUsually, when someone wakes up from a sleep while still"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6061, "rouge1_r": 0.1205, "rouge1_f1": 0.201, "rouge2_p": 0.1385, "rouge2_r": 0.0272, "rouge2_f1": 0.0455, "rougel_p": 0.3182, "rougel_r": 0.0633, "rougel_f1": 0.1055, "bleurt": 0.353, "bert_score_p": 0.8222, "bert_score_r": 0.8669, "bert_score_f1": 0.844, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1599}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5758, "rouge1_r": 0.0964, "rouge1_f1": 0.1652, "rouge2_p": 0.1385, "rouge2_r": 0.0229, "rouge2_f1": 0.0393, "rougel_p": 0.3485, "rougel_r": 0.0584, "rougel_f1": 0.1, "bleurt": 0.323, "bert_score_p": 0.8008, "bert_score_r": 0.8543, "bert_score_f1": 0.8267, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1403}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.6061, "rouge1_r": 0.0939, "rouge1_f1": 0.1626, "rouge2_p": 0.1385, "rouge2_r": 0.0212, "rouge2_f1": 0.0367, "rougel_p": 0.3485, "rougel_r": 0.054, "rougel_f1": 0.0935, "bleurt": 0.3535, "bert_score_p": 0.809, "bert_score_r": 0.8663, "bert_score_f1": 0.8367, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1311}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5606, "rouge1_r": 0.09, "rouge1_f1": 0.1551, "rouge2_p": 0.1077, "rouge2_r": 0.0171, "rouge2_f1": 0.0295, "rougel_p": 0.2424, "rougel_r": 0.0389, "rougel_f1": 0.0671, "bleurt": 0.3294, "bert_score_p": 0.7974, "bert_score_r": 0.857, "bert_score_f1": 0.8261, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.134}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5152, "rouge1_r": 0.0778, "rouge1_f1": 0.1352, "rouge2_p": 0.0615, "rouge2_r": 0.0092, "rouge2_f1": 0.016, "rougel_p": 0.3182, "rougel_r": 0.0481, "rougel_f1": 0.0835, "bleurt": 0.3471, "bert_score_p": 0.795, "bert_score_r": 0.8407, "bert_score_f1": 0.8172, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1256}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5303, "rouge1_r": 0.0771, "rouge1_f1": 0.1346, "rouge2_p": 0.1077, "rouge2_r": 0.0155, "rouge2_f1": 0.027, "rougel_p": 0.3485, "rougel_r": 0.0507, "rougel_f1": 0.0885, "bleurt": 0.3412, "bert_score_p": 0.7981, "bert_score_r": 0.8396, "bert_score_f1": 0.8183, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1253}]}

This inflammation makes the passages narrower and more sensitive to irritants. When the muscles around the narrowed airway contract, the passage becomes even narrower, making it difficult to breathe. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing and shortness of breathe.\nThe severity of symptoms varies from person to person.

Even if your child breathes very slowly and gently and is able to feel comfortable and relaxed with a certain yoga technique, remember that for people with certain lung conditions in particular, holding a single breath and trying to clear his breathing space are not recommended.\nYogic breathing requires the lungs to reach full capacity with the breaths inhaled and those exhaled. This increases the rate of breathing, and with regular practice it is possible to increase the lung capacity over time.\nMany children who are diagnosed with an Asthma-like condition also benefit from a holistic approach. There is evidence for the benefits that exercise has on mood, sleep, anxiety and depression as well as the physical and respiratory benefits.\nFor children, a gentle exercise which could provide all these benefits along with muscle strengthening is Tai Chi.

If you do go further than 50 minutes, pay attention to any signs of fatigue, so you know not to overdo it.\nJogging \u2013\u00a0 Jogging can also help with your strength, balance and co-ordination and you may find it easier to start with this exercise. Like the walking you just have to make sure you make it more of an aerobic activity and not just a stroll through the park.\nGym-based machine exercise:\u00a0 If the weather is unpleasant or you find that it\u2019s hard for you to go outside, gym-based machines could work for as they do not cause a large surge in pressure within the cardiovascular system. A good start-up exercise here is elliptical training. This is where you use levers to perform the action of stair climbing. They keep the entire body involved and ensure more muscle resistance than other forms of aerobic cardiorespiratory training.\nSwimming: \u00a0It\u2019s a low-impact exercise and that\u2019s why it works for the chest as there is no pounding on joints and muscles. The movement of the arms and legs in different directions work the upper body, hips, thighs and calves; but remember to always warm up the muscles before doing strenuous exercise.\nYoga: \u00a0 Yoga could be ideal for people who have difficulty walking or have mobility issues. Some studies suggests that yoga helps you breathe", "?\nQ. What exercises are safe for asthma patients? Please don\u2019t just say \u201ctalk to your doctor\u201d!! I\u2019m not looking for a medical answer\u2013what actual exercise can a patient safely do? I\u2019ve even had a few patients say that swimming is the best thing for keeping their asthma under control, but I doubt that\u2019s a recommendation everyone would get from their healthcare provider.\nIn 2020, this question was rephrased to ask about exercise for someone with obesity and moderate to severe asthma. The original answer still applies for this category of patient.\nA. This answer was previously published in the January 2002 issue of IDEA Fitness Manager magazine and is republished here.\nThe International Sports Science Journal published a meta-analysis of existing research on the effect of regular exercise on asthma symptoms. They found that exercise:\nIn the past 18 years, there have been several studies comparing the relative safety of different forms of exercise. None of these has demonstrated any significant difference in respiratory adverse events (bronchospasm or increase in RPE) between weight lifting and aerobic exercise.\nAll forms are equally safe.\nThere was a very large study by Van Veldhoven and colleagues in 2010 that looked at a wide range or populations with varying degrees of training and exercise and levels of asthma severity. While they looked for the most adverse effects with running, they found very little, if any difference between running and other forms training. Their main point for exercise prescription is to not choose high-intensity, high-volume training during the acute phases of an asthma attack.\nI see far more cases of severe exercise-associated asthma attacks in nonathletes, and those who exercise only a little bit (perhaps once or twice a week) than I see in active, or highly active individuals.\nWhat is most important is that the asthma sufferer\u2019s medication regimen be optimized, either via a pulmonologist or an allergist, to insure adequate control for both symptoms and lung function.\nSwimming is often touted as the \u201cbest remedy\u201d for many disorders. In fact, a lot of this comes from anecdotal information from physicians and physical therapists, since they see better results with swimming than any other form of physical therapy or medical treatment. I have found no formal, published study looking at the effects of swimming on individuals with either mild, moderate, severe or even exercise-induced asthma, so this is simply opinion.\nFinally, be aware that it is perfectly acceptable for some individuals, like myself, who have"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.625, "rouge1_r": 0.0524, "rouge1_f1": 0.0968, "rouge2_p": 0.3043, "rouge2_r": 0.0246, "rouge2_f1": 0.0455, "rougel_p": 0.5, "rougel_r": 0.042, "rougel_f1": 0.0774, "bleurt": 0.3585, "bert_score_p": 0.8113, "bert_score_r": 0.844, "bert_score_f1": 0.8273, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0733}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5417, "rouge1_r": 0.0311, "rouge1_f1": 0.0588, "rouge2_p": 0.087, "rouge2_r": 0.0048, "rouge2_f1": 0.0091, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.0191, "rougel_f1": 0.0362, "bleurt": 0.3151, "bert_score_p": 0.7669, "bert_score_r": 0.8122, "bert_score_f1": 0.7889, "hallucination": 71.42857142857143, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.0501}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4167, "rouge1_r": 0.1087, "rouge1_f1": 0.1724, "rouge2_p": 0.0435, "rouge2_r": 0.011, "rouge2_f1": 0.0175, "rougel_p": 0.2917, "rougel_r": 0.0761, "rougel_f1": 0.1207, "bleurt": 0.2156, "bert_score_p": 0.8279, "bert_score_r": 0.8306, "bert_score_f1": 0.8292, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.1728}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.5833, "rouge1_r": 0.0718, "rouge1_f1": 0.1279, "rouge2_p": 0.0435, "rouge2_r": 0.0052, "rouge2_f1": 0.0092, "rougel_p": 0.3333, "rougel_r": 0.041, "rougel_f1": 0.0731, "bleurt": 0.3298, "bert_score_p": 0.8181, "bert_score_r": 0.8195, "bert_score_f1": 0.8188, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0916}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.625, "rouge1_r": 0.0349, "rouge1_f1": 0.0661, "rouge2_p": 0.1739, "rouge2_r": 0.0093, "rouge2_f1": 0.0177, "rougel_p": 0.4167, "rougel_r": 0.0233, "rougel_f1": 0.0441, "bleurt": 0.2856, "bert_score_p": 0.7858, "bert_score_r": 0.8259, "bert_score_f1": 0.8054, "hallucination": 28.57142857142857, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0478}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5833, "rouge1_r": 0.0332, "rouge1_f1": 0.0628, "rouge2_p": 0.1304, "rouge2_r": 0.0071, "rouge2_f1": 0.0135, "rougel_p": 0.5, "rougel_r": 0.0284, "rougel_f1": 0.0538, "bleurt": 0.2616, "bert_score_p": 0.7809, "bert_score_r": 0.8217, "bert_score_f1": 0.8008, "hallucination": 71.42857142857143, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.0491}]}

The bundle of His has two main branches or divisions, the right and the left bundles.The bundle branches extend the bundle down the septal areas. Branch block is not synonymous with bundle-branch block. There are several types of left bundle blocks depending on the location of the block (proximal, distal or intercalated) within the interventricular septum. A left branch- block, LBB, means that the electrical impulses generated by the SA node travel to the ventricles at unequal rates. This can be confirmed by electrocardiography. It usually denotes a structural abnormality of either of these two anatomical tracts (called fascicles). Left sided bundle can have 3 to 4 fasciules and a block in any one or more of them may result in an LBP. However, when these three to four bundle fascicle are affected together their effect is called bifascicular block which includes BBB of one side and BBB + one fascile of bundle on other side.\nA right branch-block, RBF, denotes abnormal slow conduction of impulses to either the inferior ventricular wall (right ventricle) or superior wall of ventrical septation. If right, then this denotes the superior septam with involvement of right-sided bundle and inferior septa with left-sided involvement.\nHow are there four different types?\nThe type depends on which bundle is affected and which fascicule. For example if the anterior part of a single branch of RFB is completely blocked a QRS interval of 0.14 and 12 mm of ST-segment elevation can occur in lead V1, known as RSR'. That's called R wave in inferior leads (III and v4-6) 6mm or higher than the S wave is considered as abnormal, more so if its associated with wide Q-R-S complex i.e. bundle branching. Right fascicular blocks can also be a cause of complete R- and L.-BB and AV blocks so it may sometimes be associated to complete heart blocks like Mobitz type 2 blocks and second and third degree, i.\nIf you look at this example here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_branch_block#First_degree.2C_type_I_Bundle_Branch_Blocking_(LBB), you will see there are three varieties of LFF, depending in", "The first symptom is getting stuck when starting to work.

A branch block occurs when your heart beat doesn't properly conduct through one of your main heart chambers.\nA branch Bundle, is a main pathway of electrical conduction that travels through the left or right ventricle of the heart. When the bundle branch is functioning properly, the electrical impulse will travel through it. However, when a person develops a heart block, this bundle is unable to conduct electricity. And the signal has to \u201cfind\u201d another way to the ventricles in order to get the muscle to contract.\nWhat Type of Heart Issues Does a Bundle Branch Block Cause?\nBranch blocks are typically treated with a pacemaker because they can lead to serious consequences if untreated. In some individuals, a block in the right side of their heart will not lead the to further issues because that side doesn\u2019t pump blood as an important task as the other does. But problems on the lower left ventricular branch can cause further damage that can affect the health significantly. Problems with the branch blocks can occur alongside high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, infection, excessive alcohol use, exposure to certain medicines and smoking.\nDo Your Symptoms Signal Branch Blocks are Occurring?\nHeart beats that feel irregular, weak, or are skipped.\nDizziness. If a patient experiences dizziness or lightheadedness while standing this can be a sign that they are experiencing problems with their blood flow which is not uncommon in people with bundle of branch defects.\nSweating. Some people experience excessive sweating, especially when they\u2019re nervous. Sweating at an alarming rate or being profusely sweaty can sometimes be an indication that more is wrong than just nerves.\nShortness of breath. Sometimes breathing can seem difficult for certain people that are dealing with this problem.\nIf a heartbeat is weak or skips a beat, then it\u2019s best to have it evaluated. This doesn\u2018t always signal a problem with your Bundle of Branch. It could be something else that is causing this sensation, but it is always best you get examined professionally by a medical professional.\nAt Heart Rhythm Services of North Georgia we have 4 board-certified doctors to meet your treatment needs, such as pacemakers or Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs). These are a great way for medical professionals to treat your problem which could help to improve heart health.

Please be patient.\nA branch bundle block is the narrowing of one or more of the coronary arteries (heart blood vessels) which results in myocardial ischemia (the death of tissue that is not getting enough oxygen from the blood). If part of your bundle is blocked you usually show an elevation of ST segments in your ECG and increased Troponin I levels in the cardiac portion of a blood test.\nTreatment depends on how many branches of blood are blocked and what degree the blockage is in each branch. Sometimes it can be treated pharmacologically by treating the area with a medication such as Nitroglycerin and other the time it requires medical attention and sometimes surgery (cardiac catheterization and stenting or surgery to open the blocked area).\nWe appreciate, but our support for older products has changed.

Atrial fibrillatio and ablate of SVT are two different medical terms that have different treatment methods and techniques. If you also want to know about ablations then read this article completely.\nWhat does Heart Ablation mean?\nThe heart is a four-chambered organ that has one electrical system to control and coordinate its function of pumping of blood to the different parts of the body at a steady pace. But, sometimes the electrical circuit of your heart does not work properly which causes abnormal heart rhythm (arrhytmia) called as atril fibrilation. For this type of improper heart beat and rhythms, doctors often perform a medical procedure known as abaltion of arrhymias.\nAn abltion is done by inserting a catheter through the vein through which a doctor will be able to reach the heart. The cathater is guided in such a way that is is in contact with the nerve that causes the arrhytimia. Once the catheters comes in the contact, heat energy (electricity) is delivered through it to heat and cut (ablate) this nerve from the circuit. This technique is very useful for treating some types of abnormally fast or slow heartbeats also known arrhythmi and atria fibrilaton and SV T.\nWhen Should you Get a Heart Ablation Procedure?\nMostly, ablatons are not recommended except when your doctor finds you:\nHigh risk for more severe side effects form medications prescribed like bleeding or infection.\nHave other heath problems including:\nHeart disease, such as narrowed heart valves or heart muscle problems (coronary artery disease) that might not get better with antiarrhthmic medications.\nA history of taking other medications and getting problems like irregular heabeat\nA heart abnormality (heart defect) from birth like a hole in your hearts walls or valves.\nHeart abulation is not suitable for people with serious other health care conditions like kidney or liver problems that will make your medication not to work appropriately.\nSo, before you have abletion procedure make sure to talk to your health expert about the pros and cons of this procedure.\nCan Heart abalation help in treating atrila fibrllatio?\nYes, heart absaltions can help you in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with atrail rhyhtimia like asytonic or symptomatic nonvalvular AF.

Are there risks of atrial fibrillation after afib ablaition?\nThere are many causes ablati0n AF and they may vary according to the type of A-fib. Some patients get AF, but not a-fibs, and for others AF ablations do not work. For some patients, they require more than one procedure to get back into a rhythm and maintain that rhythm. Abplatlon, like all medical practices, does not always yield the same outcomes for all patients. Also, certain types of anitarrhythmics are necessary or better for patients who have AF as opposed to other patients; they include Flecainide, Dofetilide and Amiodarone. Certain patients have a high proabability of having recurring AF. The best way to know if abaltion is right for you is to consult with your physician. I hope this helps you.\nThere is no guaranteed success and no one can answer you accurately. Studies have shown that success rates range from anywhere to 25% to approximately 75% depending on the kind of arrythmia, the expertise of the ablator, etc. There are risks involved in the procedure, as with any surgery, some people do much better than others, again depending upon the experience of dr. and other factors. This is why it has become a very lucrative profession and patients should insist on dr.s who are well versed in Ablations and their long term complications.\nSuccess rate varies depending if you have lone af which is parasympathetic and is a simple procedure performed in out patient or one of your arteries are blocked or you are in your 40s for a first time ab. As all of you may already know, lone parsympatic af is simple and the machine they use is called ice-maps which creates cold on one part of lung and heart which basically kills nerves going to atrium which causes the contractions and therefore creates af but only for 30 seconds after you stop breathing. Once you start breathing again, nerve sends signal and you might be back in normal rhythm for one to three months. Those 4 or so patients that I did, 20% went back to af because they are at an early stage and that requires going back on that treatment for couple more times until they fix this.\nOther kind is caused by blood blocks in", "These and other burning questions are answered in this video.\nMy name is Dr. Anil Kumar and I am the director of electrophysiology at the Emory University School of Medicine. I\u2019m with Cardiologists at Emery Heart in north Atlanta. This is a question about ablations. What is abaltion? It\u2019s a procedure.\nIt\u2019s an in-patient procedure. We do it under anesthesia. A catheter is passed with the patient\u2019s body up into the heart and in some cases across the body like the pulmonary valve across it. By applying high, focused electrical current between the two catheters which are insulated except at their most far apart point, we\u2019re able to sort of destroy a small patch of the surface of it or scar a patch. In general, in normal people, an ablaton is like a high-powered photocopier.\nYou have to destroy the tissue with a little bit of heat or a a lot of cold but it\u2019s like photocopying it and then destroying the paper and the toner because we don\u2019t want it in our body. So what we do is we sorta take a copy of our surface heart but we destroy what it is with high-level electrical heat. Now, the main risk is heart wall damage, is that this is not a one step procedure that can be done.\nSo when we start it, it does it a few at a time just to see where it starts and we get better and better at it but you can never completely predict how far it will go. With every attempt, you run the risk of going too far and injuring part of one of your actual heart walls and so a big risk with it that we have for people is they might experience a low ejection fraction after it which they wouldn\u2019t have had in any of their prior.\nPrevious to the abltion.

The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.", "Must_have": ["The FDA has approved naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but it is not FDA-approved for the treatment of depression.", "The efficacy of low dose naltrexone as an adjunct treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is still under study."], "Nice_to_have": ["A pilot study is being conducted to determine the potential effectiveness of low dose naltrexone in treating relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who are already on an antidepressant regimen.", "The hypothesis is that those given low dose naltrexone might show higher rates of response compared to those taking a placebo."], "sample_predictions": ["I have been on 50mg of sertraline for 2 years and it has helped me a lot. I am now on a low carb diet and have lost 20 pounds. My depression has gotten worse and I feel like I need to do something else. Can low-dose natrexone help me?\nLow-dosage nartrexon is a medication that is used for the treatment of depression. It is also used in the management of anxiety disorders. The medication is available in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid. Low-doses of narteon are usually taken once a day, but some people may need more frequent doses. Nartreone is generally well tolerated, with few side effects. However, some patients may experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. If you are considering taking low doses of Natreon, it is important to speak with your doctor first to determine if it would be appropriate for you.\nWhat is low dosage nattrex?\nNattreex is an antidepressant medication used primarily to help people with depression and anxiety. This medication can be taken in low dosages, which can help to reduce the side effect of nausea and vomiting. Additionally, low natterex dosing can also help reduce anxiety and improve mood.\nHow does low-nattex work?\nThere is no one definitive answer to this question as the effects of low- naterex on depression may vary from person to person. Some people report that low -naterx helps them feel more relaxed and less anxious, while others find that it helps to improve their mood and energy levels. In general, however, most people who take low \u2013 naterex report feeling better overall.\nIs low Nattreson safe?\nYes, nattrison is safe to use in small doses for short periods of time. There is some evidence that natrium may help improve symptoms of mild to moderate depression, although more research is needed to confirm this. Side effects are generally mild and include nausea or vomiting.\nCan I take natarx with other medications?\nIf you\u2019re taking natarex with another medication, be sure to talk to your pharmacist or doctor about the potential interactions. While there are no known interactions between natorx and other drugs, there is the possibility of side-effects. For example, if you take a drug that affects your blood pressure, you may have a higher risk of developing high blood sugar levels.", "The answer is maybe, or possibly. It might be possible to use a small dose of nattrexon to help with severe mood disorders such as chronic depression, seasonal affective disorder or bipolar disorder. If you have had many episodes of low or no mood in your life, you should see your doctor right away if you notice them coming on again with the same intensity. Your doctor can prescribe medication that will help you reduce the severity of your mood swings and make them more manageable.\nIf you are currently taking antidepressant medication, nalmoxef acetate may be prescribed to replace the antidepressants. You may also be advised to discontinue the drug and to gradually taper the dosage of the Nalmoxicillin. NALMOXEF is available from most health food stores, pharmacies and some hospitals. A doctor\u2019s referral will be required for you to receive this medication. Some pharmacies require a doctor to order your prescription and will charge a fee for their services.\nNalmocycine is a derivative of a natural substance found in several plants, insects, fish and rodents. This natural product is used by doctors in certain surgical procedures to combat infection and reduce inflammation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naloxyfene for use as an anti-inflammatory drug. Unfortunately, there have been some adverse reactions reported by the FDA including hiccups and drowsiness. Patients taking Naloxone acetaleate are also at increased risk of developing blood clots and should not use it if they have a history of blood clotting. People with diabetes should also consult their physicians before taking this drug because high glucose levels could lead to serious complications.\nPeople who have high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, kidney disease, high cholesterol, depression or anxiety may experience serious side effects from NALTREM. Women who are pregnant or nursing should talk to their health care professionals before starting treatment with this medicine. Pregnant women might need additional monitoring because of their potential risk to mothers and fetuses should they fall outside of normal treatment procedures. Before Naltrem is taken, it\u2019s imperative that women confirm that they are not taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications. These could interfere with or reduce Nalto\u2019s effectiveness.\nWhile Nalatrem has not shown any real efficacy for the treatment of ADHD, some experts believe that it may work in conjunction with other non-prescription ADHD medicines to improve attention deficits.

Thank you in advance.\nI\u2019m not sure it could be considered LDN (low-dosage nartrexin). It can be, but if you were getting it from a different source, it sounds like you got it at a dosage that isn\u2019t safe. Because of the nature of withdrawal, if it wasn\u2019t a drug like this you would have been back to normal by now; but this would also have required a doctor to have prescribed it, usually for substance dependence.\nWe don't know of much information on narterxxin being used for severe depresssion--not that LDn is any different on this. Maybe we don\u2019t have that much info on LDNs either (since I donot see it often as something prescribed). I think it does need to come from your normal doctor for something that specific, since it comes with a prescription (in a high dose) and you do need it as a higher dose for most of it\u2019s uses.\nHope you're doing better soon!", "I take 30mg a day and only feel somewhat better.

She dropped from 100+ pounds to 68 pounds in a little under a year. This weight had accumulated because of being on massive amounts of Prozacthe only antidepressant she used for 4 years, and the loss of her husband. Once we got her a blood test done to make sure her blood sugar was fine, she started on the Wellibutrin because she also had high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

Hep A and E are usually mild and self-limiting, while B and C are more serious and can lead to chronic liver disease. D is a rare form of viral hepatitis that is usually contracted through contact with infected blood. All forms of Hep can cause liver damage, but some are much more dangerous than others. If you think you may have been exposed to Hep, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible so that you can get the proper treatment.\nHepatitis A is the most common type of acute viral Hep.

This can happen through contaminated food or water, contact\nWhat are the symptoms of hep A?\nHavrix is one of several vaccines that can help protect against hepatitis A. Other vaccines include Vaqta and Twinrix. These vaccines are given as a series of shots, usually over a period of 6 months. They are very effective in preventing hepatitis, with over 95% of people who receive the vaccine developing immunity. However, the vaccines do not provide 100% protection, so it\u2019s still important for people to take precautions to avoid getting the virus. For example, people should wash their hands frequently and avoid contactwith peoplewho are sick. In addition, there are some groups ofpeople who should not receive these vaccines, such as those who are allergic to eggs or who have a weakened immune system. Overall, these hepatitis vaccines provide an important tool in the fight against this potentially deadly disease.\nWhat causes hepatitis B?\nThe hepatitis virus can spread through sexual activity, sharing needles, blood transfusions, mother-to-child transmission, tattoos, piercings, acupuncture, etc. Symptoms of HBV include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored stools, joint pain and jaundice. HBsAg is found in blood and other body fluids of infected people. HBeAg indicates that the person is contagious and able to spread the disease to others.\nHow is Hep B treated?\nThere is no cure for hepatitis C.

There are different hepatitis of different origins, but in general they all cause the same symptoms, such as an inflammation of some organs, which may be the liver, the pancreas, etc. For this reason, hepatitis is a group of diseases that have the primary characteristic of infecting the organs.\nThe liver is one of those affected by the hepatitis. In this case, its cells are attacked, a process that leads to inflammation and the appearance of lesions. But it happens that the most common virus that causes it, namely hepatitis B, can also affect other organs such a s the kidneys, intestines, muscles, eyes, skin and heart. Therefore, some experts have questioned the possibility that these viruses are really related to multiple sclerosis, and other specialists respond no.\nOne of them is Dr. J. Allan Hobson, who is considered one the leading authorities and experts on the subject. Hobssohn is the author of The Dream Drugstore, in partnership with Robert McCarley.

The reality is that many scientists are dedicated to the development of new agents or therapies that may provide new information about what causes the disorder.\nAnd if you consider the information contained in this report on hepatitis, you may recall some of your symptoms. They range from the simple to severe. Common symptoms are pain when the person needs to urinate or defecate, as well as a weakness in the lower back and a loss of control of defocation and urination. If the patient does a lot of physical effort or exercise, there are also significant muscular spasms that are very painful, often accompanied by sudden and severe cramps.\nThere are some people who have a higher risk of developing a form of hepatitis that is not as contagious as others.

However, hepatitis A can cause more severe symptoms and even death in some people.\nMost people with hepatitis B will not have symptoms. It is not unusual then, for infected persons to have the infection for a long period of time before it is discovered, thereby spreading the disease unknowingly.\nPeople with chronic hepatitis infection are at an increased risk for developing serious liver-related health problems, including some cancers of the blood and liver. With chronic infection, there are two possible outcomes: either the viral infection may diminish in severity over several years or the patient's immune response may fail and the virus will multiply again, causing more serious health consequences.\nIt is important to note that the only symptom for some types is fatigue!

This illness can be acute (lasts 6 months or less) or chronic (lifespan over 2 months).\nHepatitis can also be caused by drugs and alcohol consumption. Viral diseases that can transmit the disease are hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. Non-viral diseases can cause other types of hepatitis such as Alcoholic hepatitis or drug induced.\nHow is the transmission of viral hepatitis?\nViral hepatitis C can appear in three ways: sexually, blood and parenterally (contamination via needle puncture). Viruses can survive for hours outside the body and can travel from one person to another through infected surfaces. In case of sexual transmission, virus B and D can affect healthy people while all other viruses are transmitted through blood, infected needles and contaminated wounds. Therefore, precautions must be taken to avoid any direct contact with blood.\nTo prevent hepatitis B virus, the person should not be contaminated with infected material in the same way as in hepatitis.

As with any kind of pain that is experienced while lying or standing upright, rib pain can get in your way of having a good day. But what are the causes of this type of chest pain?\nCauses of Rib Pain\nOne of them causes would have to be stress and tension. Stress and muscle tension in any part of our body would likely cause pains in many other parts. In particular, stress can lead to tension not only in our faces and neck but also in other areas like around the rib area. So when the muscles around this region contract, it creates pressure that in turn causes aches and pains to the area.\nYou might sometimes find yourself experiencing sharp pain on your rib. It can be a simple pain, but it can also be very uncomfortable. Aside from the symptoms, its causes can vary from one person to another.\nHow to Relieve Pain from Rib Injury\nAn injury to your ribs can come at any time, causing pain and affecting your mobility.

And, usually, it\u2019s because of one of the above reasons, for which I\u2019ll discuss further on this article. But, what causes you to experience it?\nPain in left or right ribs occurs frequently and for a variety of reasons. This pain can be temporary or chronic, but is usually only due to a temporary injury to the soft tissue. Some of these conditions include rib fractures, muscle strains, and rib subluxation. There are many causes for pain between your ribs and treatment varies according to your condition. Pain between the ribs is called intercostal pain. Intercostal muscles are located between each rib and run from the back to front. They aid in respiration and allow your chest wall to move when you breathe in and out.\nThis condition occurs most commonly when someone is in pain, such as during an injury, accident, or exercise, especially jogging. In these instances, the pain is often felt in the rib joint itself. It is then caused by inflammation, which often occurs when the bones and joints are forced into a new anatomical position, without a supportive structure. To be able to properly align the joints, they need to be lubricated, stretched, massaged, balanced, strengthened, lengthened, loosened up and finally, compressed. Sometimes, a person\u2019s discomfort is not only limited to these symptoms but can also be felt at other joints or along other parts of their body where the joint\u2019s movement is limited. For example, if a muscle or ligament is tight or inflamed, then it can lead to joint dysfunction, as well as muscle and ligature spasms.\nAlso, be aware of activities that cause you pain in your rib joints. If you play contact sports like basketball, football, baseball, tennis or any other sporting activity, you need extra protection for your body as any sudden movements, like a tackle in football or a foul ball in tennis, can easily cause injury.

There are several different types of hantan viruses, including Sin Nombre virus, Andes virus and New York virus. These viruses are found in rodents, such as mice, rats and voles. Humans can become infected with hantar viruses if they come into contact\nWhat causes hana virus?\nThe hata virus can infect humans through the respiratory tract or through direct contact. It is most commonly spread by rodents. Rodents can carry the hatar virus in their urine and feces. If a person comes into direct or indirect contact (such as through contaminated surfaces) with the urine or fecal matter of an infected rod, they can contract the disease.\nHow do you get hanna virus\nThe most common way to get the Hanta Virus is through breathing in the air that has been contaminated with mouse urine. This can happen if a mouse dies in your home and its body is not removed quickly enough. Another way is to touch something that is contaminated, like a piece of furniture or a doorknob, and then touch your mouth or nose. You can also get it by eating food that was prepared in a kitchen where there are mice.\nHana Virus Symptoms\nSymptoms of the Hanna virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and confusion. In severe cases, the infection can lead to death.\nThere is no specific treatment for the Hannah virus infection. Treatment is supportive and aimed at relieving symptoms. Patients may need hospitalization for supportive care.\nPrevention of Hanna Virus\nThere are some things you can do to prevent getting the Hanan virus:\nKeep your house clean and free of clutter. Mice like to hide in cluttered areas.\nSeal up any holes or cracks in walls, floors, or ceilings where mice could enter your living space.\nUse traps or poison to kill mice if necessary.\nWear gloves when cleaning up after mice or their droplets.\nAvoid contact between your skin and mouse drool or urine.\nIf you are", "Here\u2019s what you need to know\nWhat do we know about the disease?\nHantaviruses are the cause of an acute and potentially fatal illness called hanta pulmonary syndrome.

It is about 3 inches long and is located in the lower right side of the abdomen. The appendix has no known function, but it can become inflamed and infected, causing appendicits. Appendicitus is an emergency condition that requires immediate medical attention. If left untreated, the appendix can rupture, which can be life-threatening.\nThe most common symptom of appendix inflammation is pain in your lower abdomen, usually on the right-hand side. This pain may be mild at first, and then it may become more severe. You may also have a fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In some cases, you may not have any symptoms at all.\nIf you think you have appendicis, it is important to see a doctor right away. They will be able to diagnose the condition and determine the best course of treatment. Treatment for appendictis usually involves surgery to remove the inflammed appendix.\nWhat are some of its complications?\nAppendicitistis is the inflammation of your appendix. Your appendix sits at the end of a tube that connects your large and small intestines. When your appendix becomes inflamated, a blockage can form and cause pain. Sometimes, this blockade can lead to a rupture of you appendix, leading to serious complications.\nSome of these complications include:\n\u2013 Peritonitis: This is when the infection spreads to your abdominal cavity. Peritinitis can cause fever and chills, as well as abdominal pain and tenderness.\n\u2013 Abscess: An abscess is another complication that can occur when your infection is not treated properly. An abcess can develop in you abdomen or pelvis, often causing pain, fever, and redness.\n-Septic shock: Septic Shock is one of most serious complication of Appendicistitis. Septi Shock occurs when bacteria from your infected appendix enters your bloodstream and causes a severe reaction throughout your body. Symptoms of Septici Shock include fever; chils; rapid heart rate; low blood pressure; confusion; and difficulty breathing.\nHow is appendectomy performed?\nAn appendectectomy is surgery performed to treat appendiciitis, an inflammation or infection of he appendix that causes severe abdominal pains. During an appendecctomy, your surgeon will make a cut in he abdomen and remove your inflame appendix and any infected tissue. After surgery,", "Is a surgical or medical approach preferred for treatment of patients? Should the surgery be performed through a laparoscope? What is the role of antibiotics only? Are there other conditions that can mimic appendicits?\nThe objective of this review was to provide an overview of the evidence on diagnosing and treating appendicisitis (Appendicitus). We conducted a search in databases and hand-searched the reference list of relevant articles. We did not identify any relevant high-quality systematic reviews or well-designed primary studies. Our review addressed the clinical questions as follows:\n1. Diagnosis Is there an efficient and cost-effective diagnostic process that allows us to distinguish acute appendecitis from other non-surgical conditions such as viral gastroenteritis? If an appendix diagnosis is not feasible, are there good guidelines that direct appropriate treatment? No evidence from the studies we found could address either of these questions.\n2. Treatment What are the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical therapy for acute abdominal conditions associated pain and fever that may be attributed to appendectomists? We found no primary research studies that compared these interventions. A second research question addresses the comparative benefit and harm of a medical or surgical intervention in those patients with an existing diagnosis of appendetics. There is limited evidence that laparscopic surgical is safe and may offer benefits of cost and shorter recovery time (relative to open surgical) but we did find any comparative harms. Most evidence for surgical treatments of acute bacterial appendiceis (acute inflammation and infection of appendix) comes from secondary sources (case reports and reviews). One study (Karlsson J. 1991) (n = 14) described the use of non-invasive surgery which used antimicrobials to treat bacterial infection, with high success rates; one follow-up case reported 2 years later reported that the infection returned after 10 days, which required surgery, but the patient subsequently recovered. The treatment success rate in that study is 90%; the follow up observation was 0.5 years. No harm was reported in this study.\n3. Quality of Evidence for Surgical Treatment Only Two studies were identified that reported on surgery for appendices. One was the Karlsson 1981 case study with N =14 with a post-surgery observation of 1 month. This study investigated surgical treatment for bacterial infections without appendectomy (i.e. non-invistive surgery was performed) and found success in 13/14 patients. An overall success for non invasive surgery at", "(updated)\nWhen I started doing the research for my first book, it didn't take long for me to discover that there are some very interesting points of view around the subject of\u00a0 appendicits. Some medical professionals I interviewed described the appendix as a vestigial organ and, therefore, pointless, and didn\u2019t even recognize that inflammation of the organ was a condition at all. These people suggested that all cases should be treated as an emergency and removed immediately for a range of different reasons. Others believed that removing the diseased organ unnecessarily is almost as dangerous as being operated on for appendicities where inflammation has not yet been established, especially for children.\nEven more fascinating, however, was that some people believed a fever was not necessarily an indicator that appendecitis had set in. Dr. Michael Gendron, a Canadian general surgeon, explains this as follows:\n\u201cAs soon as your appendiitis starts to evolve, there is an inflammatory response and your body heats it up. So, we\u2019re talking in degrees, not much elevated body temperature and it\u2019s a little red for the most part. If that turns into severe and persistent nausea and vomiting, that\u2019s when most people end up coming to the E.R.\u2019s and then you may take a history that includes a low-grade, low-temperature like 98.8 F fever. That doesn\u2019t mean that the fever went from having a normal body temp and a couple of hours later spiked to 130 F. It\u2019s just that your temperature is a bit elevated from its baseline of 80 F, somewhere around 100 F and the redness and pain and swelling is worse. However, I\u2019ve seen plenty of acute appendiceal infections where a patient was very ill, quite uncomfortable with severe pain, vomiting \u2013 all the typical symptoms of appendicius, but the temperature was completely normal, only in extreme cases you might see a temperature of only 99.5 F.\u201d\nA little later he goes on to add, \u201c The fever is nothing more than an infection. The only way we can say for sure that somebody has appendacitis is for there to be a white blood count. A white count is the blood test and to raise the inflammatory markers and also having signs and symptoms. When you combine an exam with a blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, blood sugar, white cell count, you\u2019re really looking at a lot. In addition to that you have pain in the mid-abdomen, localized pain", "If so, why?\nQuestion: While working in the E.R., all it takes for me to think 'appendicitism' - even without abdominal pain - is if they say their temperature is >38.5 degrees C and they also have lower abdominal tenderness. Is this an accepted rule? I've also read a study suggesting that fever is a useful sign in ruling out appendices.\nIn children, 89% of cases were associated fever (temperature >99.9 F, I believe).\nI've read several accounts of appendectomy patients who said they did not know they had any fever prior to having their appendicectomy... so I suspect that they were not aware of them, or that it started after being in pain for a while. I guess I want some better evidence / data? This sounds to me like the usual rule is that a fever indicates inflammation, and most inflammations are caused by some type of bacterial invasion. Why would there not be inflammation when a worm is in there?\nOr am I just trying to over analyze?\n$\\begingroup$ What's the actual study, by the way? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0 user3164 Feb 4 '15 at 21:42\n$\\egroup$\nI believe you are trying (excessively) to understand in what regards appenditic infections.\nAppendicitic infections are the most common type, because they are usually bacterial (and there should always be bacteria in that part of the gastrointestinal tract).\nNot all appendicits are infected.\nSome cases are described as having an ischemic necrosis of a distal pa and as a consequence it's called gangrene of appendix. Other cases describe peritonitic inflammation and the abscess forms. It can also be described cases in which both appendix and mesentery becomes acutely inflamed.\nA less common case is the acute appendecal torsion (twisting) (not infection), the inflammation in this case comes from the obstruction of venous flow.\nUsually it is described appendicial infections as the main type.\nFever is commonly found with almost any type appendectomia (except for the gangrenous cases).\nFrequently the temperature goes with an increase of neutrophils. (Leucocytosis)\nA temperature increase above 38'C (normally found in patients that are evaluated or who have symptoms for 12-24 hrs) is considered in a normal context as fever associated to an infection.\nThe most commonly associated infection are stre", "If you are having your appendix removed, what kind of temperature should you expect?\nIn the case of inflammation due to appendiciits there is sometimes an initial decrease in fever (to hypothermia), which increases again when the temperature rises.\nIn all likelihood, there will be an increase in temperature during surgery.\nWhat is a good number?\nThe fever often returns within a few days. Do you often see fever?\nYour fever should be decreasing by now. It is not necessary, you will see in 2 days again, until 1 week. Of course only if you can stand the fever. But it also depends, whether your child can be kept awake for so long. Sometimes it is better to reduce the dosage, even if it means that the pain is more severe. If there are no fever, your baby should do better tomorrow.\nThere was also a general question, and I would like to reply to that. The first question is: I hope there won't be more infections after removing appendix.\nI had the operation on 4/21 and had fever last night again.\nCan you tell me when you noticed the change? How about your temperature?\nMy opinion is that there should not be any more fever at the time of the first appointment, ie in the second week after surgery. This also means without antibiotics. So even though you still have fever today, the chances are that in a week there still is fever.\nFrom the start, an operation is the last resort. An operation should take the burden off the appendix, but even after we have taken the appendi out, it still causes irritation in certain patients..\nI wish you could read and respond to those. I'm afraid there'll be no infection this time.", "No. A minority of patients with acute appendices may have a normal temperature.\nHow does the appendix get infected? It is thought to be due to the blockage of the vermiform appendix with either faeces or lymphoid tissue.\nWhat colour lymphatic vessels are associated in appendiceal carcinomas? They are blue because they are dilated lymphatics.\nIt isn't thought that carcinoid tumours actually arise from this site. The carcinoids of this location are known as'small intestinal-type carcinoidal tumour' as the immunohistochemical markers are similar to those carcinids arising from the small intestine.\nDo carcinid tumous invade adjacent structures? Unlike carcinodids of Meckel's diverticulum, for example, carciniods of appendix do not invade the mesentery.\nAre carcinodal tumurs of appendicus usually encapsulated? Yes.

This can relieve moderate to severe short-term pain in cases of injury or post-surgery and also long-term debilitating pain as well as help people with pain during severe cancer processes.\nWhen using Hydrocoton, your patient may appear drowsy, be restless, or have tremors. Your child may have anorexia, nausea and vomiting and constipation. Dry mucous membranes, including the mouth, nose and throat, may cause thirst and difficulty swallowing. Dilated pupils and blurred vision can also occur. When these medicines are misused or used excessively, there is an obvious risk of physical dependence on opioids.

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome, is present at birth and not progressive.", "Diagnosis of trisomy 13 usually involves clinical examination at birth, prenatal screening, and a karyotype test to identify the extra copy of chromosome 13."], "Nice_to_have": ["Symptoms for Trisomy 13 often include heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without a cleft palate, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia).", "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), high-resolution ultrasound during pregnancy, and diagnostic tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can also aid in the diagnosis of trisomy 13."], "sample_predictions": ["What are the symptoms of trismoy 18 (Edwards syndrome)? What is the life expectancy of a child with trisonomy? How is trisionomy diagnosed?\nTrisomies are genetic disorders that occur when a person has three copies of one of their chromosomes instead of the usual two. There are three main types of Trisomic disorders: Trisony 21 (Down syndrome), Trismomy18 and Trisionmy 14 (also known as Pataus syndrome). Trisoymy is a genetic disorder that occurs when an individual has an extra copy of chromosome 16. This extra chromosome causes a variety of physical and mental health problems. Trismoym is one type of chromosomal disorder. It occurs in about 1 out of every 2,000 births. The extra genetic material causes problems with the development of many different organs and tissues in the body. In some cases, trismoyme can be fatal. However, most people with this condition live into adulthood.", "\u2013 Children\u2019s\nIs Trisomia 21 Progressive or degenerativa?\nTrisomi\u00e1 a, de Down y de Pata\u00fa. P\u00e1gina de la familia\nTr\u00edsis de 18\nThere is no treatment for triseom\u00eda 22. It mainly involves the use of supportive care to help patients and families manage the challenges.\nIn the case of PTC, which is the most common treatment in most hospitals, you will need a small piece of tissue (biopsy) from the inside of your cheek. This test is done under anesthesia. To obtain the tissue for the study, the doctor will use a needle connected to a syringe.\nIf you decide to do a PTK and test the saliva, it is important to wash your hands before handling the collection device, since otherwise there is a risk of false positive results. The saliva test (PTC) is usually the preferred method because it only involves rubbing with a cotton swab, and many patients find it easier and less painful. These tests only need to be done once. In fact, there are many cases where the test does not have to detect the gene mutation if other symptoms are present. If the results are positive, a geneticist will discuss treatment options and the risks associated with them.\nAt the moment a woman is pregnant, genetic testing of the fetus can be performed on tissue obtained from amniocentesis or chorionic villi, or in the second or third trimester. All these tests involve a procedure in which a sample of amnion liquid is taken or a piece is collected for genetic analysis. Although it can cause some discomfort or discomfort, they are safe procedures that have very little risk for mother and fetus.\nChromosome study\nSome of them include a more general testing, but these are usually used in conjunction with other types of tests or when a general analysis of chromosomes is needed.\nOnce the diagnosis is confirmed, if you want to know if the mutation of these genes is present, some of its causes may include trisisome, P, P (Down) and 19 (Edwards). If you have no results from P or P testing and are not sure what condition they have, other ways to confirm the P23 diagnosis, one of which involves having a chromosome study or analysis to study an individual\u2019s chromosomes, including their gene sequences.\nFolkets Trisisomie 17, syge\nFor these cases", "Is the chromosome test performed at diagnosis helpful in determining prognosis?\nPrenatal diagnosis by chromosome analysis with amniocentesis, cell free DNA or CVS is very helpful to determine prognosis. The chromosomes are analyzed in the karyotype by fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH and/or array testing. Trisomies tend to progress in severity and often, chromosomal testing can help in understanding if the chromosomes will progress worse with time.", "Will it worsen, become more severe?\nTrisomies are the most common type of genetic abnormality in neonatal loss, and there is an increased recurrence risk in future pregnancies. Pataus syndrome has become much less well recognized with the advent of maternal serum screening, but the incidence appears to be about 1/5,000 pregnancies in the world today. With advances in ultrasound and genetic studies, the vast majority of babies with Pateaus syndrome are detected in utero. A normal baby is born with 46 chromosomes in each cell - 23 pairs. In trismy 21 and trimumy-13, an extra chromosome 22 or extra 42,9 respectively is present, giving 47 chromosomes per cell. Most cases of Pateau syndrome result from a marmation or mutation of the paternal chromosome pair. The mother and father each contribute 44 chromosomes to their child, so the extra set of chromosome must result as a result of a non-disjunction of chromosomes during the cell division of gamete formation in either the father alone or in both the mother AND the farher.

There is no quinee, quinnie or quino. You are probably referring to quina, the Spanish name of the bark of Cinchona tree, from which quinia is extracted. In the 19th century, when quinea was the only source of this alkaloids, there were many attempts to synthesize it, with no success. Nowadays, synthetic quines are available, as well as quins, derived from quinas.\nQuines and quinos are not the same. They are different alkalines, although they are both derived of cinchonine. Both are used as antimalarials, however, they have different pharmacological properties.", "Does quina have any other benefits?\nAnswer Quinine is a natural remedy for legs cramp. It has been used in tonic water for decades with the flavoring of quinoa in it. Quinidine is the active ingredient in quinoline. This compound is used to treat leg conditions. But since quinnidine has serious side effects, it is now classified as a drug to be prescribed by a doctor.\nTonic water contains quinin and a weakly acidic substance called quinite which is not soluble, so it has no effect.\nAnswer 1 - Quini will help relieve leg pain but it may have side-effects such as heart problems, hearing problems and hallucination. Therefore, ask the doctor to prescribe it instead of buying it.\nThe problem is that quinia is highly dangerous if you take it without medical advice. Please do not do it but let a medico prescribe and guide you for taking it properly. Thanks.\nQuinine water does help in relief for leg muscle cramping.

Is it also effective for other pain types?\nBy admin on Thu, November, 3,2016\nTo prevent the problem, sipping a glass of sarsaparilla every evening has been mentioned as helping to cure an intermittent cramp.\nOn the other hand, while many swear by it, it is not known to be effective against leg pain. Therefore, we cannot take as fact the claims of anyone who has used quercetin to relieve their leg pains.\nIf your leg is in pain because of lack of muscle strength, the following are some of the more common causes:\n\u2013 Obesity or overuse of joint.\n\u2013 Arthritis.\nTherefore, to ease the pain in one\u2019s legs should depend on the specific type of leg discomfort. There is also the question of whether quince in the water is an adequate treatment. While quincense and sartine are present in certain foods, there is no single known food containing all these substances. Although the presence of these two compounds in some foods has not yet been established, some researchers think that the compounds present are also contained in querns.\nSodium in its present form is very different from that found in human body. In fact, many studies have demonstrated that it cannot be absorbed by our body to a large extent. It is important that, for the sake of health, foods that contain sodium should be eaten regularly.\nThis helps avoid building up excess amounts of sodium in our system and which then will be used in various bodily processes and then to aid in maintaining physiological balance. The presence or absence of quinse in foods is definitely linked to this difference.\nThe other reason why many people are not aware that quinn is effective as a food and that its lack in their diet is contributing to their discomfort is because they are unaware that this particular chemical is found abundantly in food. Quinn is widely available and is often part of a typical diet.\nIn fact there are foods which do not have any quinoa in them and still the quine is present. However, quino is a necessary food which means that a lack is only likely to develop with insufficient intake of this specific food or with the addition of too much sodium that is used by the body for maintaining the salt level equilibrium.\nFor example, in order to find querno in apples, a variety of fruits and vegetables should also be included. Most fruit juices that are commercially available are deficient", "Are other solutions? Any experience?\nI do have one question.

Muscle contraction is induced and regulated by calcium (Ca+2). Ca+ 2 plays an important role in the regulation of muscle tone. According to a report, Quinine relaxes skeletal muscle by reducing the influx of calcium across the muscle cell membrane.\nAlthough the mechanisms underlying quinidine's anticonvulsant and antilipidemic effects may occur through the inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels and the P/Q-type channels. L- and P-type calcium channels play an essential role because during high-frequency stimulation, the large, sustained Ca(2+) inflow, which occurs through P-/Q-type and ryanodine-sensitive Ca 1.1 Ca3+ channel types, is primarily responsible for the Ca (2) overload. During repetitive stimulation of skeletal muscles, P- /Q- Ca1+ -type and Ca7+1-type rytanodin-sensitive channels produce a large sustained inflows. The calcium inflowing may cause the calcium overload and calcium-dependent degeneration. So, quine can play a role on the prevention of the overload of quench, and that may prevent the degenerative process itself.\nIn summary, my own study supported the results of other reports that found quino can reduce the leg muscles through Ca inflowy. Even though quining is known as a dangerous drug, in appropriate amount, it could be a promising effect to be the treatment of cramping muscle.", "[duplicate]\nWhat\u2019s better for cramp: quinisine gluconate + soderbolic salts or plain water?

Is it okay to drink wine while taking medications? These are all questions that many people have asked themselves at one point or another. The answer to these questions depends on the type of medication you are taking and how much alcohol you consume. In this blog post, we will discuss the safety of taking certain medications while drinking wine.\nIs It Safe To Take Medications With Wine At Dinnertim\nIs Wine Safe With Medication?\nWine is a popular beverage that is enjoyed by many. It is also a common ingredient in many recipes. However, some people may wonder if it is safe for them to consume wine if they are on medication. There are a few things to consider when answering this question.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to know what type and dosage of medications you\u2019re taking. Some medications can interact with alcohol and cause serious side effects. If you have any questions about whether or not it would be safe, you should always consult with your doctor or pharmacist.\nSecond, if you do decide to have a drink, be sure to do so in moderation. Drinking too much can lead to dehydration and other health problems. So, enjoy your wine responsibly and in small amounts.\nFinally, remember that everyone\u2019s body is different. What may be fine for one person may not be for another.\nIf you want to be on safe side, then it might be best to avoid drinking alcohol while on medications. But if your physician has given you the green light, go ahead and enjoy a nice glass (or two) of your favorite wine!\nWhat Are The Risks Of Taking Medicines With Alcohol?\nThere are many risks associated with taking medicines with alcoholic beverages. Alcohol can interfere with the way your body absorbs and processes certain drugs, which can make them less effective or even dangerous. Additionally, alcohol can increase the side effect of some medications, such as drowsiness or dizziness.\nIt\u2019s always best practice to speak with a doctor before taking any medication, especially if alcohol is involved. They can help you understand the risks and make sure you take the medication safely.\nWhat Medicinal Drugs Should Not Be Taken With Alcoholic Beverages?\nSome medications should not to taken with any alcoholic beverage.

If an herbal supplement seems to alleviate stomach distress and a glass of wine takes the edge off the discomfort, how do you know how to treat your body? The simple answer is to talk to your healthcare provider. Your physician and pharmacist are the best resources for this particular question, particularly as the answer can change over time. In order to help you understand your medications and how they impact the body, let\u2019s start with two general pieces of advice: don\u2019t take your meds at least two hours before or after you eat or drink, and don't mix your medication with alcohol, including wine.\nHow wine affects your digestion\nDigestion is just one aspect to look at when you ask how wine impacts your health.

That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0178t mean that alcohol is good for you, it just may not always be harmful. You just need to remember that moderate drinking of any alcohol will negatively affect your liver.\nWhy you should avoid alcohol with your medicine\nThe best advice for any medication is not to drink alcohol. That may sound extreme, however it is crucial advice to follow. Why? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the biochemistry of drugs - the way they work in your system. Medications that you take orally affect how hormones and enzymes function in the gut, kidneys, liver, or wherever in you system the medications are absorbed. And because many people who use drugs for chronic conditions rely on alcohol to cope with pain or side effects of their disorders, you will need a thorough explanation on your alcohol interactions to determine if or when a small glass is safe.\nWhile there is no formal definition of moderate alcohol use, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that women (or men) should make choices that limit intake to:\nUp to 1 drink per day for women\nUp To 2 drinks per for men\nThese limits reflect the amount of alcohol that typically does not lead to negative outcomes such as an increased risk of an alcohol-related injury or illness.\nThere are two things to think about when", "Here's a look.

Hypoglcyemia is a condition where the blood sugar level is low. It is also known as low blood glucose or low glucose. The normal blood level of glucose is between 70 and 100 mg/dl. If the level falls below 50 mg/ dl, it is considered as hypoglcemia. In newborn babies, the normal level should be between the range of 40 and100mg/dL. A level below this range is called hypoglcemia. This condition is very common in babies. About 1 in 10 babies are born with hypglcemic. Babies born to diabetic mothers are more likely to have hypgylcimia. There are two types of hypglycima. One is transient hypolcema and the other is persistent hypolgycemia.\nTransient hypolyemia occurs in the first few days of life. Most of the time, this condition goes away on its own. Persistent hyplyemia lasts for more than 3 days. Some babies may have both types. Transient hypoylcima is caused by the baby\u2019s inability to produce enough glucose to meet the body\u2019s needs. When the mother is diabetic, her baby may not be able to make enough insulin to use the glucose in his or her body. Insulin is the hormone that helps the cells in our body to take in glucose from the bloodstream. Without enough insuline, glucose cannot enter the cell. As a result, there is not enough energy for the brain and other organs to function properly. Another cause of transient hypo is when the placenta is damaged during delivery. Placenta provides the nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. Sometimes, when there are problems with the placent, such as placental abruption, placenat infarction, or placentitis, these problems can lead to hypogylymia in a newborn. These problems are usually caused during pregnancy. They can also occur during labor and delivery.\nPersistent hypylyema is usually due to problems in how the pancreas works. Pancreas is an organ that produces insulin. Problems with how it works can cause hypylcyema. For example, if the beta cells of pancrea are damaged, they cannot produce insulin properly.\nThere are several ways to treat hypgylyma. First,", "These are concerns that a mother may ask herself and may feel overwhelmed. How can she protect her unborn child from a condition that may be potentially life-threatening? By learning as much as possible about hypoglyaemia and becoming aware of conditions that will increase your risk of having a baby with hypoglycemia during your pregnancy, you can learn how to manage it. Hypoglucemic disorders appear in around 10% of newborn infants. However, hypolgycemic newborn disorder usually is not associated with long-term effects.\nNewborn Hypoyglycemic Disorder\nHypolycemias are characterized by extremely low blood glucose (sugar) levels. It can be referred to as a sugar level of less than 70 mg/dl in a newborn.\u00a0 It is extremely important that you keep track of your glucose levels at all times during pregnancy. If you\u2019ve notice low levels, contact your doctor so that they can make the proper precautions.\nHypo-glycaemia is common in infants, as their glucose requirements at this stage of growth is very high. This could be because the baby may have hypotonia or low muscle tone, making his muscles and other muscles less active than usual. In some cases, the muscles might not be working properly to start with, or the blood sugar levels may simply be lower than normal.\nCauses of Hypo-gylcaemic Newborn Disorder\u00a0\nDuring pregnancy, it is important to take the time to keep an eye on your blood pressure. You may need to change the way you are administering your medication or simply take more time before you take them on. While this may not seem like a big deal at the moment, it could make all the difference later on down the road. Pregnant women should also keep a watch on their blood levels during the pregnancy to make sure that it doesn\u2019t rise too high.\nSymptoms and Signs of\u00a0Hypoglcemic Disorders\nDiabetic mothers are very susceptible to have babies that suffer from Hypglycaemi. Mothers who suffer form diabetes are likely to suffer problems in gestation. Therefore, babies born to women who have diabetes or were diagnosed with diabetes during their pregnancy are more likely than the rest of the population to be born with this problem.\u00a0\nAlso, premature birth and low birth weight are some factors that put the infant at risk for developing hypglycaeimia due", "My daughter was born and her BG was 27. Can I avoid this next time?\nMy son when born had hypogalacema too and he was fine by the time we were in the car on the way to the hospital. He was also born at 35 weeks and has hypothyroidism so it can take a while to get your levels up.\nThis may be over simplifying things, but I believe that because of all the changes the babies body experiences, the insulin becomes less responsive to being activated and the blood glucose levels go up before the body has the ability to metabolize and clear itself.", "This is an issue that you will not find very much information about online. It is a problem that I came across during the course of another research project.\nI had been advised by a specialist to undertake a study on the causes of Hypothyroidism. During that research I investigated the link between low thyroid and low blood sugar. I have to mention that in terms of natural medicine one's own body should have a natural ability to regulate the blood glucose levels. However this is not true in everyone!\nHypoghydemia, in the simplest of terms means low sugar levels in blood. This problem is so severe that it can be fatal within hours unless urgent and immediate treatment is given. In simple terms it means the newborn baby is unable to maintain a normal blood level of sugar due to an ineffective glucose system within the cells of the body.\nThe signs of hypogycemia are very difficult to identify if the baby does have the problem. One of these signs often seen is Jitteriness and twitching. A medical professional will take blood tests to detect low glucose level but not always will the signs be present. If the Jittriness is seen a paediatrician may be called in. To me this seems strange, why are paedarticians involved if it is the Hypothroid isms that causes this problem in particular??\nWhat are the possible causes for hypothyrodism?\nAs to the cause for low levels of thyroid production I will leave as that is my own specific study and research. You can find that information by clicking on \" hypoyroid\"\nTo come back to this discussion on Hypo glycemia.\nWhat is Hypoythyroidis that caused by?\nIt is basically a deficiency in Thyroid that will lead to hypoglucemia which is in fact low carbohydrate level.\nMy research has now come to include all the symptoms for both. Thyro ism is just the opposite to hypo. the word thyro-ism refers to goiter and the lack of thytoide hormone production in your childs thyroid. Hypythyrod is referred to as a hormone in general for your body and can effect many organs.\nIt's a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone.\nNormally, the thyroid releases small amounts of hormones into your bloodstream, which are carried to every organ of your your boby. These hormones tell", "What happens if a woman has hypogilcemic syndrome prior to pregnancy. Will the baby be ok?\nHypogylcemi in the newborn can be fatal to any child born that way. The condition is caused by insulin production before the child is born or the development of a condition like diabetes before birth and at birth. Children are sensitive to all medical conditions in this way because their bodies and their hearts are much smaller and are usually in a state where they are not able to keep up with regular demands like an adult.\nA pregnant women that wants to prevent complications like hypglycimi might want to see her doctor as soon as she finds out she is pregnant to rule out any possible condition. These conditions tend to be genetic and the mother would not know about certain symptoms unless a doctor tests her regularly during pregnancy.\nDoctors usually give children born with a medical condition a low dose of regular insulin as a precaution to protect the children. This helps babies that are born without hypglcyemia and it is especially helpful to babies born premature. When children come into the world before a certain gestation date they can have a harder time coping with their environment. A dose like this is usually enough to help the babies transition into a new environment and make a full recovery with no added risk or complications.\nIf a women has a tendency for hypocglyemia that she has gotten a diagnosis on, she will most likely get the same conditions passed down onto the fetus and children she delivers. However if she does know and can treat this condition throughout pregnancy she might be able give up some of her own insulin and give better nutrients to the unborn child while still taking in normal amounts herself on a day to day basis.\nI have had hypoglcecemia the whole time I have been pregnant and have just had another baby with hyperglycemica. I believe that my baby had a different blood type or something like that because when we saw doctors they were able too find this problem.\nHowever, I do not think I would want any other women to take my advise or to not let a mother be tested if they know they have hypos in their families. Everyone is different and not everyone is going to get this type of condition but it might save some children's lives or give them less risk for it to develop down the road.", "According to an article by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) an infant with Neonatal Hypo is typically born with a normal blood sugar level, but blood glucose drops to low levels.\u00a0 This happens from the time they are born up to 60 hours after birth.\nNeonatal hypoglocemia tends to occur more often in pre-term infants than those born after 40 weeks.\nIf there are no complications by 48 hours of age the mother is advised to begin normal feeding.\nSigns of Hypoblycernia\nThe mother of a baby is not likely to know her baby has Hypoglcyemia especially if the infant was born prematurely or large or very small, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\u00a0 However, if infants are bottle fed a mother should observe her infant\u2019s behavior, as in formula fed infants.

It is essentially x-rays of the body where images are taken from several different angles. A CT is better quality than an xray.

It is necessary to evaluate these situations also with physical examination.", "CT Scan and Diverticular Disease\nA CT (computed tomography) scan can detect signs of diverticular disease or any complications of it in your colon (large intestine). Since the colon is easily read on a CAT Scan, finding evidence of a divertictilitis, diverticloular disease, a perforated diveictulum, is easier to see and make the diagnosis for your doctor. Most of the time the CAT scan is able to determine the extent of inflammation along with the abscess, peritonitis, etc.\nThe CT scanner uses x-rays along other forms of electronic scanning to create a 3D cross section of any part of your body, including the area around the large intestine. Because a barium enema can tell your physician about the inflammation and other conditions of colon disease the CT helps diagnose more readily the condition. A CAT may also be helpful in determining a polyp in addition to diverticulties.\nSince CT scans are not usually used to evaluate for mild divertivulilitits or asymptomatic divertulular disease. This type of examination (CT scan) is not recommended in routine, healthy people as it is for those suffering from symptoms like pain and diarrhea.\nCAT Scans are also used for the detection of cancerous changes in the skin, liver, lungs and bone are commonly evaluated by a computed tomogram. Other examinations of this type may include a cardiac CT for examination of arteries in and around your heart.\nDiverticula are small pouches in any of our abdominal organs. They may be in our oesophagus (swelling leading to heartburn and chest pain), bladder (also called as bladder divertica), or intestines (small intestine, also called Meckles divertcula). They are present in nearly all adults over age 70. Rarely found after age of 30.\nIn the intesting they also are called diverticitlits when symptoms develop. The small sacs are very common and in 90% of patients over the age are 80 - 10% will have some degree of these divertucles or sac in their digestive system. Often when these small pockets of intestine develop they cause no problem at all. But, if they become inflamed they can be more troublesome. When these sac become irritaed they lead to Diverrtilies.

What are some of the best ways to prevent the spread of colds and flu? In this article, we will discuss the different ways that cold and influenza viruses are spread, and how you can protect your loved ones from catching these illnesses.\nThe most effective way to protect against cold viruses is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water. This will help remove any germy particles that may be on your skin or in your nose and mouth. You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, as this can spread germines from one person to another.\nAnother way that you and others can prevent cold virus spread is by staying home when you are sick. If you have a cold or flu, it is important to stay home from work or school so that others do not catch your illness. It is also important not to go out in public when sick, especially if you will be around other people who are more susceptible to getting ill.\nIf you do need to leave the house while sick with a common cold, make sure to cover your mouth and nose with either a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. Also, try to avoid close contact with others as much as possible. Finally, if someone in the household is sick and has been diagnosed with the flu or another contagious illness, take extra precautions to keep them away from others until they are no longer contagious.\nHow do cold & flu viruses spread?\nCold and Flu viruses can be spread through direct contact, indirect contact and airborne transmission. Direct contact occurs when an infected person coughs or talks near another person who then breathes in droplets containing the virus. Indirect contact happens when someone touches something that has come into contact an ill person, such as a doorknob or keyboard, then touches their own mouth or nose. Airborne transmission occurs if an unwell person sneeze or cough into the air and someone else breaths in those droplet particles.\nWhat is the difference between a Cold and the Flu?\nA cold is a viral infection of your upper respiratory tract, which includes your sinuses, throat, airways and lungs. The flu is an infection caused by the influenza virus that can affect your entire body. Both illnesses can cause similar symptoms such such fever, chills, body aches, fatigue and cough. However, the symptoms of a flu are usually more severe than those of an ordinary cold", "How can I protect myself?\nCold and flu viruses spread primarily through person-to-person contact (coughing or sneezing). This puts anyone close to an infected person at risk. It helps to wash hands often to protect yourself and others.\nA runny nose, congestion, and cough are some of the typical signs and symptoms of having a cold and the common flu.

When exposed to other common viruses or bacteria (e.g., influenza and pneumococcus virus) an individual develops what we call a \u201csecondary infection.\u201d In such cases, the illness may be much worse than the condition on which it is superimposed (i.e., the cold) and may even cause death.\nIn contrast to respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses and bacteria, fungal spores are not transmitted from human-to-human; they are found throughout the whole environment. Therefore, respiratory tract infections (bronchitis and pneumonia) due to common fungal species are seen in those individuals who are immunocompromised, as well as the very young and very old. A common bacterial infection associated with a sore throat and fever is acute pharyngitis.\nAre There Different Types and Degrees of Common Cold and Coughing?\nAccording to Ayurveda, most cold and cough problems are Kaphaja.

It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Metforin is an oral medication that helps to lower blood sugar levels. Metfornin works by increasing the amount of insulin that the body produces. This helps the cells in your body to use glucose more efficiently. The drug is available in tablet form and is usually taken twice a day. You should take the drug with food to help prevent stomach upset. If you experience any side effect, you should contact your doctor immediately.\nMetforine is the brand name for the generic drug metoprolol. Meforine belongs to a class of drugs called beta blockers. Beta blockers are used for treating high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure. They work by blocking the effects on the heart and blood vessels. When you have high cholesterol, your blood vessel walls become thick and stiff. As a result, the blood flow through your arteries is reduced. Your heart has to pump harder to get the same amount blood through the arteries. Over time, this can lead to heart disease. To prevent this from happening, doctors often prescribe beta blocker drugs. These drugs help relax the muscles in and around the artery walls. By doing this, they reduce the pressure on your heart. In addition, beta-blockers can help lower your cholesterol levels.\nMefo is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for type II diabetes mellitus.

The other 1 0 patients receive placebo. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were recorded at baseline and after 30 and - 90 days. Baseline characteristics (age, bmi, percentage of fat mass, and fasting plasma glucose) were similar in two treatment groups at a significance level p 5.05.\nFor 12 patients in Met group, no adverse effects were found. Met treated patients lose a greater weight, had reductions in hip, waist, systolic blood pressure and bmi. No clinically meaningful changes in systo!ic or diastolic BP were observed in patients treated with PLACEBO.\nSignificant differences between met and placebo were noted for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resis- tance (homa \u2013 ir), total cholesterol (tc), high density lipoprotein (hdl-c), hdl-c/ total\u2013c ratio and triglycerides (t gly). Met significantly decreased the insulin sensi- bility index, the total amount of cholesterol, Hdl and t glycerin.

Thanks for your help.\nSubacute Sclerosising Panencepahalities ( SS PE) is an extremely rare complication that can occur after measles infection. It is more common in children than adults, although it can develop in any age group. The risk of developing SS P E is very low, even in those who have not been immunized against the measles virus. In fact, the risk is so low that it would be very unlikely that you would develop this condition.", "My father developed the disease which is caused by measles virus at age 71 and he had never been vaccinated against measles when he was a child. Please help me out.\nSSPE is Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis. Measles Virus, the causative agent for this disorder, may also cause serious complications like encephalopathy or death. The onset of symptoms, in most cases is between age groups of 4-12 but this rare (very rare) disorder may develop in adult too. This virus enters the central nervous system by binding to the cells of the brain known as oligodendrocytes and disrupts its function. Its actual mechanism on these cells is not well understood. People diagnosed with SSIP usually have a history of having measles at an early age. There are still debates regarding how measles is related to SSPI. According to some, SSNI is a result of a chronic infection of measles whereas others have argued that the incidence of SSNE is increased if not the person had at least one attack of atypical measles during childhood years. In the meantime, even the measles may have been eliminated in various countries like US, Canada etc SSRI cases are not getting rare.\nIt is an established thought that if the child had an attack to measles, his chances of developing SSIE is 50 times higher. An infection with measles triggers the immune system which, later on may produce antibodies against the virus to keep it further attacks or any recurrence. Some antibodies may react against brain tissue of their normal functioning, which damages the myelin membrane of oligonodroglia and affects its functions. Though these antibodies are produced against other cells which are different form oligodeudrilos but they are mistaken as a target cell due to their common characteristics. Antibodies produced by the body against these tissues may be related with the autoimmune diseases as well.\nThere is no known treatment for SSNP, since it is fatal in the end and progresses with devastating effects. A combination of drugs like auranofin, isoprinosine, and methotrexate are used to manage the symptoms and its rapid progression. It may sometimes be treated with a corticosteroid to reduce the seizures or inflammation with is more rapid and aggressive with these drugs. No vaccine for preventing this is available but vaccines for other diseases are administered during infantile years (2 months old) which reduces the chances.

Thank you in advance for your answer.\nMeasles is caused by the measles virus, and there are a number of subtypes of this virus. In some cases a sub-type of the virus that you were vaccinated against (or had natural immunity from) is able to enter your body, but cannot cause the disease (i.e. the infection is \u201csilent\u201d). However in some of these cases, over a long period of time this sub -type might be able the cause a disease later \u2013 in my opinion this is not very likely, although I can\u2019t prove it mathematically.\nThanks for the answer. Could you please tell if it has to be a subtype, or all the viruses that cause measles could?\nSomehow, I had an impression, that since vaccine contain only live viruses, the ones which are used for vaccination has some difference from those viruses in natural outbreaks, probably only a small difference, i.e., a vaccine uses subtype of one virus strain and not all.\nThere are indeed several sub-types. The vaccine has been changed several times to match the most prevalent sub type in a locality (as has the natural strain). However, each of them still causes the same disease. So, for instance type B3 which is prevalent in the US will get you ill in Sweden as well as type D8 which would be prevalent here.

The clinical course of this disorder is discussed in more detail than before.[5] A patient was first reported to be ill in May 1978 with high fever (40\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C), followed by a rash, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathies, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea. Although these symptoms were suggestive of measles, the patient denied ever having received a measles vaccine or a natural measles infection. A measles IgM antibody test was performed, but the initial results were negative. Consequently, an anti-measles virus (MV) test using an intra-cutaneous vaccine was done in an attempt to induce MV-neutralizing antibodies, instead of vaccinating with a live vaccine; this test also gave a negative reaction. After three months, a second MV Ig M antibody titer was determined and this revealed a clearcut measles seroconversion. Aspiration cytology revealed large, mononuclear, multinucleated, giant cells in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen, taken from the lumbar subarachnoidal space. These results suggested that a subacute sclerosing pancreatitis (SSPE) could have resulted from a delayed natural MV infection, rather than from natural SSME.[10]\nWe followed an SSNE patient who had received vaccine and who died. This patient had a remarkably progressive course and a histological diagnosis was made from biopsy specimens. Our present case provides a further opportunity to learn about the clinical features of viral encephalitis. In addition, this is only the second case in which the disease was diagnosed clinically before an autopsy was undertaken, whereas the histopathologic data from all previous cases were based on biopsy material.\n## Case report\nA 9-year-old right-handed girl was admitted to hospital with an uncertain diagnosis on 17 Oct. 1986.

What are Kts?\nKets is defined as a rare syndrome in which there is an excessive and overgrowth of tissues. This occurs because of genetic abnormality which leads to the production of extra amount of protein causing abnormal growth. Usually, this syndrome affects single body parts like the face or arm but it can also occur in different parts of body with each body part showing varying degree of involvement.\n2. How do we diagnose it?\nThere are some symptoms that are usually present during early stage which includes enlarged body organs suchas heart, liver, pancreas, spleen and thyroid gland. Some other symptoms can include short stature, large hands and feet, and abnormal skin.\n3.

And the average age at which they were identified was between 4 and 12 years old. When they finally diagnose and get rid of it, it stops growing, usually disappearing by the time they've reached their teenage years.\nIt is unclear how many patients need to undergo treatment, because the rate was extremely variable: some lesions disappeared, some required intervention and some simply grew on and got bigger.

I don't know if she is right or not. What is your opinion?\nIron is an essential mineral that is needed for the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Iron is also needed to make myoglobin which is found in muscle cells and to help the immune system function properly. The body does not make iron, so it must be obtained from the diet. A diet that contains too much iron can be toxic. In the United States, iron toxicity is most often seen in children who have accidentally ingested iron supplements. Adults who take iron tablets for anemia or iron deficiency can also be at risk for iron poisoning. Symptoms of iron overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. If you think you have taken too high a dose of an iron supplement, you should seek medical attention immediately. Your doctor will likely order a blood test to check your iron levels and may also order an abdominal x-ray to look for signs of damage to your stomach or intestines. Treatment for severe iron overdoses may include the use of a medication called deferoxamine, which helps to remove iron from your body.", "Are people on the verge of death, or at death's door, sometimes saved from themselves?\nIt all depends on how many pills you take, in my experience, so far as the people I care about are on iron pills (for treatment and prevention of anemia). 15 pills, maybe, is serious; more than that, it really can kill you. A little too much of iron in your veins can block oxygenation to organs, and that can lead to problems with those organs. I think people who have swallowed a whole bottle of pills are sometimes rescued, yes.\nIt's kind of strange that a woman like you would have even one woman in her life, because you seem to take a very unfeminine position with these questions that I've been asking you, which are about sex, reproduction, how people can make babies after babies are born. Women in our society have the idea that if you don't reproduce it means that you're a freak, that God has cursed you with sterility, but in fact this is not true, as you can plainly see.\nTo go back to what I was saying and to continue on that line of thought, I'm talking about when there are no pills whatsoever; I don t have anything because I get them every once in a while; and then I am having intercourse with my husband and I need to get more pills right away. Also, there's the question of what's going to happen if he should decide to leave me someday? If this was going on, if this happened very, very often, when I got to some doctor s office to ask them for birth control pills and he just started saying, Look, this woman has had too many children already, you know what, she's already over the top.\nBecause it was only a question that came from here, from the doctor's office or the women's health organization, not from me, anyway. The man has to do the same thing as me and the woman, except that he also has the option, after all, of simply stopping the pills. This isn't like, say, a man having a vasectomy or taking something else that s irreversible like with a girl child's birth-control pill. Yes, he can have two or four of them, depending on what he wants.", ".\nAfter taking Iron pill, what will be the first symptoms? what should we do?? Please help.\nThis is a standard course of treatment.\n1.When you are sure you have taken a higher dose of iron pills then prescribed for you then the best thing is to take it again at the hospital. This is because iron is poisonous and can even cause poisoning.\n2.In case you took a very high dose, it is preferable not to induce vomiting as it may worsen your condition. But you should not wait until the symptoms appear.\n3.If you suspect that you may have a severe form of poisoning then you must check your pulse, blood pressure and level of oxygen in the blood.\n4.If these conditions show any adverse effect then this person must be given a supply of fresh air, fluids and glucose to treat hypoglycemia.\n5.In a critical case of severe poisoning the person should be admitted to hospital for further treatment.", "He has been diagnosed with anemia and prescribed iron supplements. I know that people are told not to flush iron pills; but what do you do for the individual who has consumed many and it is likely, if not certain, that he/she is quite concerned? The pharmacist who gave the pills told him/her not take them together with food but no explanation was given. This person does not drink alcohol and is a teetotaler. He/she does live on his/her own.\nThe best advice I can give you are the recommendations of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Their recommendations are to:\nGet the person to the nearest hospital as rapidly as possible.\nWhile waiting for an ambulance or your own transportation, try to keep the victim calm and at the hospital staff is present try talking about something other than the symptoms.\nIf you think the iron tablets have come in contact with the stomach contents of a drink, such as soda or wine, give an adequate amount of water or milk to dilute or neutralize it.\nDo not use anything in the home to try and help remove the poison. The iron will not pass quickly through the intestines but will actually absorb nutrients from foods. That means laxatives won\u2019t work.\nCall the emergency number 911, unless the poisoning is not severe and a ride to a hospital is available.\nA doctor or nurse should check the patient at a local hospital emergency room to make sure nothing bad is happening.", "He only took 10 mg. It was supposed to be 100 mg according to the directions. What might possibly happen?\nMost likely nothing at all will happen.\nWe are not doctors, and have no way to determine what dose of medication was in the bottle. You obviously know more about the medication than we do. Please ask your pharmacist about this or a doctor or hospital if you are really concerned about what happened.", "My boyfriend is a type A personality and a bit OCD and he accidentally double dosed. After 12 hours he is just starting to perk up, and feels his body may just purge most of the iron out when the body is done processing it. He's not sure and is starting the process of taking a charcoal tablet to help prevent absorption. I can tell he feels terribly guilty but I know it's an accident and it does happen. Should we call the Poison Control Line? Can we give him something like milk or juice? Help.\nWell, I am probably not the right doctor to consult, but let me at least give you the answers I would give if you call a poison control center (and maybe you should do just that).\nFirst, how many pills did he take? How much iron is in them?\nNext, is he a Type A guy about this, too, or is it a bad idea for you to call me. Well, a dose of 5-10 grams, taken by mouth, as iron pills, (not \"regular\" table salt) is potentially life threatening. As I said, let's call poison.\nI had been told this might have happened to me, although I'm not totally sure, maybe I just ate too much spinach. It was like my body just turned black, all of a sudden, from the inside out. And I have had more then my share of headaches! But my doctor said I couldn't call and talk to him either. Apparently there aren't enough doctors in the world to go around!\nIt could have been iron toxicity, caused by a little overdose. Spinach does contain iron, it is better absorbed from meats. For adults with anemia, 50-100 mg 3 times a day is often recommended, if on a liquid diet (like intravenous feeding) that may be even more. There is no absolute rule on what we would consider a safe level, nor what may cause problems. We know that in adults, more than 20 grams IV given in more 1 hour is life-threatening and can cause kidney failure. So, given orally, this amount should be much less.\nThere is an antidote available for iron poisoning, \"Desferrioxamine\", which is not available as a prescription, that the poison centers could use.\nThat is one answer, however you may want to consider the following possibilities:\nI know this is going to seem lame and trite,"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.0, "rouge1_r": 0.0, "rouge1_f1": 0.0, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0, "rougel_r": 0, "rougel_f1": 0, "bleurt": 0.3078, "bert_score_p": 0.0, "bert_score_r": 0.0, "bert_score_f1": 0.0, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.0}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.0, "rouge1_r": 0.0, "rouge1_f1": 0.0, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0, "rougel_r": 0, "rougel_f1": 0, "bleurt": 0.2781, "bert_score_p": 0.0, "bert_score_r": 0.0, "bert_score_f1": 0.0, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.0}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.0, "rouge1_r": 0.0, "rouge1_f1": 0.0, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0, "rougel_r": 0, "rougel_f1": 0, "bleurt": 0.4038, "bert_score_p": 0.0, "bert_score_r": 0.0, "bert_score_f1": 0.0, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.0}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.0, "rouge1_r": 0.0, "rouge1_f1": 0.0, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0, "rougel_r": 0, "rougel_f1": 0, "bleurt": 0.29, "bert_score_p": 0.0, "bert_score_r": 0.0, "bert_score_f1": 0.0, "hallucination": 20.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.0, "rouge1_r": 0.0, "rouge1_f1": 0.0, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0, "rougel_r": 0, "rougel_f1": 0, "bleurt": 0.2848, "bert_score_p": 0.0, "bert_score_r": 0.0, "bert_score_f1": 0.0, "hallucination": 80.0, "comprehensive": 33.33333333333333, "fluency": 0.0}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.0, "rouge1_r": 0.0, "rouge1_f1": 0.0, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0, "rougel_r": 0, "rougel_f1": 0, "bleurt": 0.2879, "bert_score_p": 0.0, "bert_score_r": 0.0, "bert_score_f1": 0.0, "hallucination": 40.0, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.0}]}
{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

Is it true that the child of a diabetic can be expected to be diabetic? In other words, is disease usually passed from parents to children? And is it possible to prevent heritable ricketts? These are but a few of the queries one hears from the public.\nGenetics is not only the science of inheritance but is also concerned with the chemistry of reproduction. Although its principles are rather simple, they are complicated by the facts that both males and females have two sets of genes and by crossbreeding, inbreeling, outbredding, and genetic drift. Some of these complications are discussed in the following sections, but not in any detail. Genetics is a vast and highly specialized subject, which has been the object of much research and controversy for many years.\n**The Genetic Material**\nThe most important of all genetic units is DNA. It consists of two long chains, each made of nucleotide units, wound about themselves like a string of beads about a knitting needle. These chains are joined together by hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases on the strands.\nDNA carries the genetic information that makes it the heredo-deuter. The genes are segments of DNA which, by a process of mutation, undergo changes in arrangement. When the two strands are separated, one for each parent, the process known as replication can take place in such a way that each strand is copied, segment for segment. As long as the copying is exact this will account for the likeness of father to son, mother to daughter. In heredy rickts, however, an error has taken place. One of its basic chemical units has undergone a change from adenine, guanine, thymine (or cytidine), to either a different kind of purine ring or a ring for a pyrimidine acid. This can cause ricktis in an otherwise normal child for reasons which need not concern us here.\n## Genetics and Public Health\nAlthough the mechanisms of genetic transmission are well understood, there are numerous variables which add to the complexity of predicting the outcome of various genetic combinations and, particularly, of what changes can occur in their future expression.\nEach human being has 24 chromosomes, 23 of them the autosomes, i.e., the chromosomes which are not paired; they appear to have no sex differences. Paired are chromosomes 1,2,3,4,5,6", "A child with mild forms will not feel that anything is wrong, although most will have some form of the condition. However, the main factor in rachitic development is vitamin D, a deficiency which causes bone disease that can only be prevented by exposure to sunlight as far back as the days when the human species began to evolve. Vitamin D is important in helping the body to absorb calcium. Other ricket-related conditions include: The main aim of treatment for rick is to increase the level of vitamin-D and calcium in the patient\u2019s body.

The first known mention of rhabdomyolysis in relation to a football game was in 1996, when ten players playing a game in Minnesota, US sustained rhipidid from a combination of overexertion and lack of hydration. What is Rickets? Ricketts disease was first described by Thomas Sydenham in \u2026 When you think of childhood maladies, what diseases do children get that you remember experiencing as a child - or maybe that your kids have? This article has been rated as Start-Class. In humans, this disease is characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone, which results in softening, pain, and skeletal deformities, as well as bone fractures. Rhab-domy-OL-ee-sis. Many physicians still call rictus a rachelite smile, but not as much as they did in previous years. It could also affect the function of glands such as parathyroid glands.

Because of this, there is a 3/4 (75%) likelihood of the disease not being passed on. However, if one has only one gene left, the risk could rise to 50% in the event that the other parent can be a carrier. The likelihood is one in four for two carrier individuals, that is 25%.\nWhat are the signs of rachitis?\nIn very early cases of childhood rashes, no symptoms are present, but the growth and development of a rash are common. This happens during the first and final years. Children also run the chance of having problems with vision and motor coordination. In many cases there are problems such as cataracts and joint issues (rachitic roseola). Although it\u2019s very rare, a few individuals are also given severe rickety syndrome.\nIs there any method to prevent rhesus disease?\nPrevention is more effective than treatment. It is important to ensure that infants are able to get sufficient amounts of vitamin D. Most countries require supplementation through the milk formula and the diet to avoid ricks. Another preventive measure comprises calcium levels to the bone. Rickettsia can develop into osteomalacia due to inadequate diet and excessive reliance on phosphorus-rich foods on children.\nCan you cure this disease with exercise and calcium? ricket disease in adults? Vitamin D isn\u2019t only found in oily fish and oily foods. Certain foods, including cereals that are fortified have Vitamin-D supplement. Many countries are now providing their own milk and food products fortified with VitaminD or D3. Vitamin supplements can also be taken to boost levels. When the nutritional intake of calcium is low patients may be advised to take calcium supplements for women or other medicines.\nWhat\u2019s the danger of developing osteoporosis-related disease? Osteoporotic diseases like brittle-bones and brittle bones that have been caused by too little calcium, as well as a lack of Vitamin d can result in problems later in life.\nHow can you get rid of bone issues related to calcium deficiency or ricky-like symptoms? The best methods to combat osteopathy will be to improve diet by getting enough calcium and vitamin-D.

But, unlike other diseases, it is not contagious; it occurs when body calcium and vitamin D are low, resulting in bones that are weak, fragile and prone to breaking. Ricket is caused by a deficiency of Vitamin D in childhood. Since Vitamin is synthesized in the skin under UV light exposure, a lack of sunlight in northern climates was thought to be the main cause.\nHow to use Vitamin d3 cream for rickety baby\nWhen the cause of rachel was confirmed in 1919, this knowledge was exploited in an attempt to eradicate the disease. However, despite all the efforts (and despite some successes), it became clear over time that not all cases of the ritch were caused solely by lack; some cases were also due to metabolic disorders, such as kidney diseases. And even when the lack was actually the reason for the existence of a rach, its prevention through simple measures such the provision of fresh milk or by exposing children to sunlight was quite unsuccessful. For some time the medical profession and public activists were puzzled. On the one hand, the number of cases was much lower than previously expected. This is logical, since the new medical knowledge provided the tools for correct diagnosis and successful treatment. Another thing was the high percentage of black and Hispanic children with racha. By the 1980s, public attention began to shift to rackets in populations where the deficiency was more likely (such as indigenous peoples) and where vitamin deficiency and sunlight exposure were only a part of it. It was also realized that some ethnic groups, while living in a climate that is usually exposed to lack, could be protected by genetic adaptation to their environment. Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism is important in this context; genetic polymorphisms have been linked to susceptibility to a variety of diseases and are important for their prevention and treatment.\nThe heritability of many human traits and diseases\nThere are many different human diseases that we know are genetic in nature.

You might have heard this illness by different names like fibrositis, fibrotic condition, neuromyositis and fibrosis disorder. Whatever you think of it, the reality is that fibroids are very painful and can disrupt your everyday activities. In fact, it can also affect your overall mood and well being.\nHowever, a big myth in the treatment of this problem is \u2013 the use of surgery. As a matter of fact even though surgery is used in extreme cases, in most cases it is not required. This is because fibroid can be easily removed surgically in some cases. So rather than opting for an operation, you can simply get the fibroma treated with medicines. These medicines include:\n* Herbal medication \u2013 These medications can cure fibrodysplasia very effectively. However, these medicines can work more effectively only if you choose a qualified alternative practitioner, or one who is trained in alternative medicine. The alternative practitioners will always choose the most effective and efficient treatment methods and procedures for their patients.\n* Antibiotics \u2013 Antibiotic medicines are often prescribed by physicians to treat this type of disorder which affects the nervous system, such as fibroatomy. Fibrosis is a very common disorder, which occurs when the normal function of a fibrocystic breast tissue, due to infection or damage.\nThere are no known reasons for this disorder; though, research studies show that the disorder may be due primarily to bacterial infections. Due to this reason, antibiotics are generally not used to cure this condition. Antibacterial agents will only help in relieving the pain caused by the inflamed fibrose.\nAlthough it has no harmful side effects, yet, if it causes pain, one can take over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen to alleviate the symptoms. Ibuprofin and other non steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers can sometimes cause side-effects to pregnant women and children. They are dangerous for children, so it\u2019s better to avoid this medication.\nSurgery \u2013 Surgery is another kind of treatment used for treating fibrouse disease or fibrome.

It causes widespread chronic pain with trigger points to a heightened sensibility of the body to pain. Pain affects the entire body with fatigue, stiffness, poor sleep, and mood swings.\nWho suffers from fibrromyaglia? It is about 80% women who suffer from this type. Women suffer about three times more than men. Fibro is not a disorder, but it is an abnormal physical change that occurs to the pain pathways that signal the brain. The patient with fibro becomes more sensitized to trigger pain.\nHow can a Chiropractor help in the treatment? When a person suffers or lives with pain, it can interfere with the quality of life and daily activities. A patient will be encouraged to exercise, eat healthy, make lifestyle changes, stress management, relaxation techniques, acupuncture, massage and chiropractic. Chiroropractic will help loosen, balance and stabilize the muscles of pain areas (including the trigger point which is the main cause of fibrosymaglai symptoms). The chiropractor will also provide exercises that are specific to strengthening these areas to help reduce pain and strengthen muscles.

The person can produce anything from mildly decreased to severely decreased (which is very rare) levels of an enzyme, which is actually a cofactor for methylation reactions in the body. If the mother of the child in question has the mutation, she probably has elevated methylmalonic homocysteine and reduced folate. She doesn't look at her folates at all. So she supplements with something like folinic acid to make sure things look good in her urine and when she goes for pregnancy testing. That helps to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Once mother and child have that out of control, then she looks at methylcobalamin levels. They're going to be lower, because methyl is bound with homcyte and vitamin B12 gets consumed while doing those reactions. Folic acid and folacin won't help. You can't take a bunch of folic; you can get the methylated folacins. As long as she's supplementing with that, it will help convert to methyl cobalum and methionine. To address other cofactors for the reactions, especially cystathionin and cholinesterase, they help produce the same cofacor that can be used to produce methonine which can then form choline. Supplementation can make everything work better.", "What are the possible complications?\nIn short, I do not believe A-129-8-C, also known as the A1289C polymorphism has anything to do with homocysteine metabolism, per se. \u00a0So I really cannot comment on long-term prognosis.\nI would think that the long tern prognosis would depend largely on the total body homosystein level. I believe that Mthfr polymorphisms are only the beginning of the pathway of Htc accumulation. This, in turn, can lead to elevated homostein levels, which in tum, may lead not only to high homostenyotin levels but to other related conditions, such as hyperhomocysterinemia, thrombosis and vascular disease.", "?\nIf your question was really directed at me, let me assure you that I never really understood this question. I am a member of Yahoo's forum: Mthfr.net. The answers seem to vary greatly. Some have taken a long time to manifest symptoms of M.T.H.F.R. Others have experienced symptoms in early years (mine was 21).\nThere also seems to be a variation of symptoms that can be experienced by M.t.h.f.r. sufferers. My experience was (and is) with the Methyl/Ado Met/ Homocystne pathway. This pathway is not complete until the AdoMet can properly transfer the methylation to the SAM pathway which would then complete the process of the metabolism of folic acid, B12, etc. As I recall Adenine, and Guanine are transferred but the Serine is missing. Thus, the transfer of a methylated base to other processes and hormones is impaired.\nMethylation (that is the insertion of methyl groups) is a process that involves much more than the processes that we now know so well. Methylation is involved in the manufacture of neurotransmitting substances like Serotonin, Dopamine, Melatonin and several other hormones.\nI still don't have all the answers. So far, I have not found a doctor that really understands the entire processes.\nThe best advice I can give you for now is to seek out the book \"MTHF and Gene Therapy\" by Dr. Richard Shames. A list of doctors that \"know\" can also be gotten from the Yahoo Group. They are: Drs: Sherry, Mickle, Jockens, Brownstein and a small number of others. These all are from various parts of country. Dr's Sherr and Brownsten practice in Oregon. Unfortunately. you would be one of many thousand needing their services. One of these doctors could be the one that leads to success.\nOne last suggestion, go to a local Health Food store. Many have a vitamin specialist that may know somethings.

It is best to take vitamin in the form of D3 as it is more readily converted into a useful form.\nIn some instances, a person experiences digestive distress and flatulent is the result of very high dosing of cholecalciferol (vitamin d).\nA better, more gradual approach to vitamin deficiency is to use vitamin k2-7 which actually directs calcium from soft tissue to bone and teeth to prevent bone mineralization and other problems.\nThe other problem is that vitamin A is converted from vitamin and there is a risk of hypervitaminosis A if the amount of this form exceeds daily needs.\nIf someone has been instructed by a doctor to do high dosage of Vitamin D (D3), it should be taken very strictly as prescribed.

Vitamin\u00a0D is a hot topic and many people are beginning to realize there\u2019s a link between deficient\u00a0levels\u00a0and our thyroid function. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple.\nIt helps reduce pain and inflammation, protects our bones, and boosts our immune function.\u00a0Vitamin\u00a0D has the potential to affect the thyroid hormone, thyroxine, although research confirms it does have some positive effects.\u00a0In one study of 1,600 women with underactive thyroids, researchers at the University of Rome found that\u00a0women with low levels of serum 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D) or vitamin \u00a0D had worse outcomes. However, further analysis showed that only the 400 or so \u00a0nurses who had vitamin-D levels above 30 ng/mL also had better outcomes.\nThis is very interesting. In 2014 I went in for a routine checkup and everything was normal. Later I got a call from my doctor, telling me that my thyroid levels were high and that I needed to be on a medication for the next year. That next check showed my levels at 5 and they said that if they didn\u2019t go down, then I would need to take something for life. Well now four months later, my level is at zero. All I\u2019m doing now is taking Iodine on an as needed basis and I\u2019ve been taking D-3. 24,800 IU daily. As I said, there is one check, one week from today to determine my next action, but the doctor told me to get my D level as high as I can and to use the iodine.

Vitamins are micronutrients that are not generated by the human body, therefore we must get it from food sources or by supplement.

We\u2019ll also look into the pros and cons of a traditional medical insurance plan, as traditional policy has now become the least popular option for anyone with a chronic disease or condition.\nIf you have a pre-existing medical condition, or a lifestyle that includes a number of risk factors, it\u2019s more than likely that your insurance premiums are going to be higher than someone with no preexisting conditions or lifestyle-related risks. There are many different ways for insurers to determine how much you\u2019re going pay for your policy, including age, where you live, any underlying health concerns you may have, how many kids you plan on having and your medical history, among others.\nYou can also choose to purchase a \u201cgap\u201d policy that is designed to fill the gap between what your regular insurance will cover and what Medicare covers. This type of plan is often known as a Supplemental plan.\nThis type is not actually insurance, but a service that helps pay any leftover expenses that Medicare will not pay. It\u2019s also called secondary insurance and can often be added to a primary health plan like Medicare or Medicaid. Medigap insurance can be used with many policies, though it is typically more expensive than other alternatives because it covers expenses beyond what the primary policy would.\nMedigapp was introduced by Congress to help seniors pay their deductibles and coinsurance. All Medipaps must obey to the same regulations, so that they are all basically the exact same product, allowing seniors with limited incomes to save on costs related to Medicare.\nFor more information on Medicare and medigaps, visit the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website.\nThe average annual premium for a Medigaap policy is $3,300, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some policies may cover additional benefits, such as prescription drugs and hospital stays if certain requirements are met.\nPeople who have Medicare but don\u2019t meet all the requirements for coverage may be required to pay out-of-pocket expenses, known in the industry as deductable copays.\nTo be eligible for medicare, seniors must have had at least 12 months of consecutive", "The shingle cell membrane that lies below a single row of roof tiles is the weakest part of the roof. The sun will expand and contract at different temperature levels. This allows rainwater in which, in turn, will break out the nails securing the shingled sheet. A roof leak can be a devastating experience for the inexperienced individual who has to take the risk of doing repairs on his own. It can cause further damage to the house if not done correctly.\nShingles are thin sheets of wood or fibreglass that are laid over a roof by roofers in Sydney. They are nailed to a timber frame and are connected to an additional piece of timber in a frame attached to timber beams which are then fixed to walls or buildings. Shingles can also be built-up shakers, which make them more complicated to construct. Single-piece shingers can often be damaged by heavy winds. In this situation it is important to contact roof repair companies.\nThere are two primary types of shinge: concrete and fiber cement. Concrete shinders have been the most commonly used over the past two decades or so. However this type of concrete roof tile roof has a high rate for water damage. While cement shinges may be strong enough for some applications However, they\u2019re not appropriate for damp areas. Waterproof coating is therefore recommended for waterproofing these varieties of tiles.\nIt is essential to hire professional roofing contractors to repair and waterproof both types or concrete shindles. Most roof repairs are usually required only during the winter months. Roof leaks can occur inside a building due to heavy snowfall and excessive humidity. If water is not properly drained, it can seep through doors and windows, causing water-damage to cabinets, flooring, and walls. Water leaks could also damage the structure of your house such as the walls and roof.\nLeaky shings are typically caused by two different issues. There could be an issue with the seal underneath the tile. Another reason is an ineffective installation of cement tiles. Leaks can result when roof cement is placed on a surface that is wet or contaminated by debris. You may need to replace damaged or loose roof shins.", "It\u2019s a matter of science, but one study has come to a surprising conclusion. Shingles cause is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which was originally responsible for chickenpox.\nAfter about two to three weeks after the infection, there is no longer detectable virus in the body, and the rash itself begins to fade away. The cause of shingled bumps is reactivated dormant virus within sensory neurons, a part of nerves which connects to the skin.\nShingles is a recurrent virus which causes painful skin eruptions typically seen as shingle bumps or shingly bumps. As the person suffering from shings heals, new cells grow and take the place of infected cells and are therefore called \u201cshingly\u201d because they resemble shined or polished skin. Some people may experience pain for longer periods of time after having shinged. Doctors have been able to pinpoint one of many triggers for shinge that seems to contribute to why some patients have recurring shinges.\nResearchers from the University of Utah found that those who smoke at least two packs of cigarettes daily were more than twice as likely to have a bout of recurring herpes as those not smoking. Researchers are still not quite sure how this link is made but believe that chronic tobacco use may affect the immune system in such a way as to decrease its ability to produce enough antibodies to fight off the virus.\nAntibodies are made up of two major compounds that are used to help fight against various bacterial and viral infections: the T-cells cells which are partof the white blood cell family; and b-cell, another part that is part. B-celli cells are also a main component of how the liver protects us against disease. In addition, they help break down fats and cholesterol.\nSo what causes the shin and shiver, the pain, itching, tingling, rash and burning sensation that some people experience when they get a shig? Experts believe it is because the nerves in and around the face tend to be more sensitive because of their proximity to other nerves. This can make a person have more sensitivity in certain areas. For instance, if your throat gets sore when you eat something or talk, it may be because your tongue is more closely related to another nerve than it does your tonsil.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that all cases of facial herpes are caused only by shivering or itching. There is still a chance that it can only be caused when the sore is on the tip of your nose", "Here's a look at how shingle treatment can relieve pain and discomfort.\nShingles is a painful infection that can be triggered when the chickenpox virus in the body becomes re-activated. It typically happens as a result of lowered immunity, such as during a period of illness. While shingels can generally be treated and heal, it's important to seek professional medical attention in time.\nSo what is shings and and can shington be cured? Read on to learn more about the causes, signs, and symptoms of this painful ailment.\nWhat is Shingles (Herpes Zoster)?\nSymptoms of Shingon (Zona)\nSymptons of shnails include pain or itchy sensations on the skin, accompanied by lesions which form along nerve strands. The majority of people who have contracted shangon previously suffered from chicken pox as children.\nTypically, the most painful symptoms are in fact the itches caused by the rash rather than the virus itself. Symptoms can last for anywhere between weeksto a month. In rare cases, shingly can cause long-lasting nerve pain that's called post-herpetic neuralgia. This can also cause headaches, fatigue, fever, or other flu-like symptoms.\nThere are a few different kinds of symptoms that one may experience with the herpes virus. First of all, there's the actual rash on your skin. These might seem like blisters, but they're actually filled with liquid called fluid or serum. You might also feel prickly, tingly sensations, aches, swelling and burning sensations. Swelling around the lymph nodes may be another symptom as well as fever and fatigue.\nThe rash usually appears a day or so after the itching has stopped, which is why it could be mistaken for a bacterial infection or the flu at first. A few weeks later, once healing has occurred, you will notice scabbed-over lesions. However, if you're unlucky enough to develop postherpes neuralia, these effects can stay with you for quite some time or even for life. Be sure to talk to your doctor about any lingering symptoms or concerns you may have about them.\nHow Common Is Shingle?\nWhile shinging itself can usually be effectively suppressed with modern treatments, unfortunately, post-zoster or post-shingle neuralgias can potentially lead to painful chronic conditions that affect the sensory and motor symptoms. For example, in some cases people may develop pain even when no lesions are present.\nIt is thought that", "Here are the answers, plus everything you wanted to know about this common painful viral rash!\nYou may have heard that, in addition to causing chickenpox, the herpes zoster virus can also cause shingling. This highly contagious virus causes a blister-like skin rash in nearly 90 percent of people who\u2019ve ever had chicken pox. Here\u2019s what you could do about it!\n1. Why is shingle (also known as herpes Zoster) called the same as \u2018Herpes Simplex\u2019?\nShingles is also known by the clinical name of \u201cHerpetic Ophthalmitis\u201d or \u201cshingle\u201d. This term was coined in 1899 when a French ophthalmologist who was treating a patient, accidentally discovered the skin-tingling pain and discomfort known today as shins.\n2. How do Shingles start?\nIn most cases, shingers start as a rash that appears on the face or in the armpit or between the thighs. Pain, burning, tingling, aching, or itchiness may develop in these areas. However, only 50% of patients have symptoms within the first day or two following the rash.\nYou must contact your doctor or the nearest emergency room in order to be correctly diagnosed and inquired as to what type of virus is causing the shiners.\n3.

First, it's very important to see a practitioner who can determine the root cause of your pain. Your pain is not normal for your age as you point out. Pain can radiate into the hip and legs and many things can cause this. It's also important that you receive support and education about pain management. Many people end up using pain drugs that can take their lives and that shouldn't be. I hope you're able to find out what's causing your nerve pain and pain relief. Keep us posted.\nHi @margaret55, @brianlyons and I also have some chronic pain from a disc injury (at age 17) and have trouble telling when I push myself too hard and can get very sore and stiff for several days after something a little beyond a 'normal' workload.\nI am 70 years old, but my experience would point to what @tammieh said. There is something wrong that is causing this pain... and even at 20 or 30 it wouldn't have been ok to have pain like this.\nGood job on getting some help to deal with it.\nHow do you handle your post physical activity \"recovery days\"?\nWhen we are young we take advantage of the ability of our bodies to recover relatively easily from some damage. As we age we can more easily overdo it or do more than we recover in time for.\nSo my advice would be to identify when you've overdone something and take a day or two to just let yourself rest and heal.\nYou will probably feel some discomfort for a few days... then that stops. This can save days of pain down the road when we push too far and don't allow time to rest.\nThat's something I struggle with every day as I need to pace myself to continue to work fulltime and still do the things important in life.\nWhat's important is that we have people like you working to help educate others on aging in ways that help keep us healthy and allow us to stay safe and independent longer.\nThank you so much for sharing that. You and others do make an impact in the lives of others.\n@timmeh I have found that as we get older, the body tends to heal more slowly and so the rest period is greater. In my case", "I have taken ibuprofen with good results, but it makes me feel bad. Is there a better treatment?\nThere are several medications you can try that may give you some relief. Here are some options that you have, and their respective side effects. Your pharmacist may have other suggestions for you.\nIbuprofin works as a pain reliever. It can cause upset stomach, heartburn, diarrhea and constipation. Also, it can affect your stomach lining if taken for a long time.\nAcetaminophen may be a safe alternative to ibupfrofin. Many common medications contain acetaminphen in them. For example, Excedrin has acetamentinophan; Percoset contains acetiminophin, Aspirin is a different kind of medication that can be used but is similar in the way it works. If you take acetominophien on a regular basis you may need to be careful as it may effect your liver. Take only the recommended doses or speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\nTopinrol (Tofranil, elavil) is an anti-depressant that acts as an pain killer. Possible side affects are drynness of mouth, constippation, sedation. Check these side effect when you are not using these for depression.\nNortriptyline (Pamelor) may also be an alternative.\nLidocaine patches may ease pain. They have no bad side-effects unless you apply too much. There is also capsaicin cream that is sometimes used for neuropathic pain that gives some analgesic effect by depleting serotonin and norepinephrine from nerve endings for several hours. Again, this works best when applied at bedtime.\nIn more extreme cases, you should ask your doctor about other treatments such as anti-convulsants. Gabapentin comes to mind as one of the best treatments for chronic pain problems. A second line treatment is Pregabalin also known by the drug name Lyrica. These agents are good for nerve pain, though they may cause some dizziness as side-affects.\nIf leg swelling is the problem, diurectics may help. Lasix (furosemide) or hydrochlorthiazide are available over the counter. Ask about these if your leg appears to have fluid swelling.\nThe last option is narcotics such Tramadol, Ultram, Percocet.

The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies.

Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.

And I have been experiencing problems with my thyroid and have had an increased blood cell levels in my blood work.\nCVID is one of the hypogammaglobulinemias, a variety of blood disorder characterized by deficiencies in a portion of white blood cells called \"B cells,\" which have the job of producing antibodies, essential elements of immunity. When there is insufficient amounts of normal antibodies to fight off common bacteria, infections can occur that can become resistant to antibiotics. Cycles of antibiotics may result in greater chances of a superinfection. Common bacteria that occur frequently in Cvid patients include bronchialitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, and gastrointestinal infections. Other illnesses occur as well, such as recurrent ear infections, strep throat, urinary tract infection, skin infections, and hepatitis C.\nIgA is a serum protein that belongs to a group of serum globulins called immunoglobulines. Immunoglobulin proteins, or antibodies, are secreted by white cells in the lymphoid tissue. The function of antibodies are to protect the body from harmful agents by acting against the antigen and by agglutinating and precipitating toxins, bacteria or soluble antigen. Normally, IgG and IgM antibodies circulate in plasma and are involved in infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such in pneumonia and in recurrent urinary infections. IgE and Immunoglobin are usually confined to mast cells involved mainly in allergic reactions. On the other hand, the main function og Ig A and also Ig D (immunoglobulus D) is in mucosal immunity.

{"Question": "What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body?", "Free_form_answer": "Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves.

There are three main types: type 1, type two, and gestational diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of the disease, affecting 90-95% of all people with diabetes.\nType 3 diabetes, also known as gestation diabetes or gestatational, is when a woman develops diabetes during pregnancy. This type is usually temporary and goes away after the baby is born. However, it can lead to type II diabetes later in life.\nWhat is type one diabetes?\nType one is an autoimmune disease that causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin. Insulin is needed to convert sugar into energy. Without insulin, the sugar builds up in the blood and can cause serious health problems. People with type I diabetes must take insulin injections or use an insulin pump to control their blood sugar levels.\nThere are two main forms of type III diabetes: insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent. In insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the patient\u2019s body does not produce enough insulin to meet the needs of their body. Non-insuline dependent (NIDM) is caused by the inability of cells to respond to insulin.\nThe symptoms of both types are similar and include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, slow healing wounds, tingling or numbness in hands or feet, mood swings, irritability, depression, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, memory loss and more.\nHow does type three diabetes affect your body?\nGestational Diabetes (GDM) occurs when the mother\u2019s blood glucose levels are higher than normal during her pregnancy.\nGlycemic control is important for both mother and baby. If left untreated, GDM can result in complications such as preeclampsia, preterm labor, macrosomia (large baby), and stillbirth.\nSymptoms of GMD include excessive thirst and urinating, blurry vision and fatigue. It is diagnosed through a blood test called a glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test measures how well the placenta is able to remove glucose from the bloodstream.\nIf you have GDD, you will need to monitor your blood sugars closely during your pregnancy and after delivery. You may also need medication to help control your glucose level.\nDiabetes is one of those diseases that can be managed with proper care and treatment.

Here are eight facts you should know about diabetes.\nType 1 and Type II diabetes are both life-long diseases of the blood that stem from the inability to make insulin efficiently. However,\nType I (Diabetes mellitus) is a disease of a faulty immune system where the immune cells, which should be keeping us healthy, are actually attacking and killing insulin-producing cells in our pancreas.\nThe pancrea is responsible for producing hormones that help regulate our metabolism, blood sugar, and glucose levels. Type I diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood.\nInsulin is the hormone required to store glucose in the liver and other body tissues. Without enough insulin, the glucose builds up in your blood and the cells then begin to malfunction.\nDiagnosed at an earlier age and requires treatment with daily insulin injections or by an insulin pump. People with Type-1 diabetes require regular insulin pumps.\nThere is no cure or prevention for Type l diabetes, however, good blood sugars and regular exercise may help prevent complications such as blindness, kidney failure and amputations. Diet can also play a key factor in managing Type1 Diabetes.\nRisk factors for getting Type\u00a01 include having certain HLA types (genes that increase the likelihood of Typel diabetes). Some of these Hla genes are found in 23% of people with diabetes. Unfortunately, little can be done to prevent Type! diabetes\nType II (Non insulin dependent diabetes)\u00a0 is characterized as high blood glucose due to either a decreased ability of cells to use insulin glucose, or to the diminished blood insulin.\nMost commonly found as a complication of an aging population who have gained weight in middle age, it is becoming far more common in children now as well and is more likely to affect people in low and middle income countries.\nPeople who are diagnosed with this type of Diabetes can generally lose weight and become healthy with life style changes, exercise and nutritional changes or medications.\nYou\u2019re three times more at risk if you\u2019re from one of\u00a0the world\u2019s 10 most affected countries (USA, India, China, Egypt, Mexico, Indonesia, Pakistan, France, Germany and United Kingdom)\nIt\u2019s four times as likely if your family has or had diabetes - especially with your immediate family members like sisters, brothers, parents, etc.\nObesity can lead to diabetes or makes it extremely hard to treat- which is why it\u2019s vital to get and stay at and", "The type of cell that stores and releases the extra glucose in the blood is called a \u03b2-cell. This cells is located in pancreas. Pancreas is an organ in our body that produces enzymes which helps in digestion of our food. It also produces insulin.\nInsulin is a hormone that controls the level of glucose (sugar) in blood. When the sugar (glucose) level in your blood rises, it signals your pancreases to start making more insulin. Insulin then causes sugar to enter your cells to be turned into energy, which makes cells grow and work right. However, if someone has type 2 diabetes, their body may fail to respond properly to insulin, a condition called insulin resistance.\nWhen we eat a high calorie meal, the food gets inside our system and it's broken down into small pieces which include glucose which will enter our bloodstream. The hormones in body will signal the beta cells in pancreatic gland to release\u00a0 enough secretion of Insulins.\u00a0 Insulsion will cause the cell to store the glucose and the energy is used when the cells are active. As mentioned earlier the insulin secretion is regulated by hormones and other factors. Type 1 diabetes is when a person's body does not have its own insulin production. Cells stop working and are destroyed due to lack of insulin (a hormone which allows the passage of sugar from blood to cell). If the required insulin amount is left unused, cells become weak and unable to produce energy. After sometime the entire glucose is converted to fat which causes weight gain.\nThis type affects the children and teenagers who have diabetes. In these conditions, body doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin to control the high sugar level. Symptoms of type I diabetes are:\nA person affected with this type also needs insulin injections to survive.\nType 3 diabetes: This type is also known as \u201cneonatal diabetes.\u201d Neonatal means babies, as this condition affects children. At birth infants with neonatal Type III must be immediately treated for diabetes with insulin through an incision into a vein in their leg. Doctors usually have patients with Type I stop giving them their daily insulin during pregnancy and start giving themselves two to four times normal doses of the hormone after they give birth to avoid high blood sugar levels after child birth.\nAs this is common in child. Child who has neonati diabetes will require insulin injection. Most of them continue to need insulin till their adult life.\nFor people with prediabetes or type II diabetes it is important", "Diabetes is a common disease affecting millions of people around the world.

If you are experiencing type one diabetes then this means that our body produces very little insulin, but your body is still using the same amount that it was before. Type two diabetes is the more common type that most people think of when you ask about diabetes; this happens when your cells begin to resist reacting to the insulin that is in your bloodstream. It is caused by a variety of lifestyle factors, including diet and exercise.\nWhat causes these types?\nDiabetes can be caused be a few things, such as your parents genetics and race. With gestation diabetes, it happens during pregnancy and it is an excessive amount of sugar in you blood. There are so man different factors that could play a big role in this disease. Gestational Diabetes happens in women, although you might not be able to tell when the baby is born if the mother is going to have it or not.\nWhy is Diabetes so serious?\nIt can seem as though it would be something that would make your blood sugar levels really high, which wouldn\u2019t seem that dangerous. However, diabetes can put you at risk for several different health risks if it isn\u2019t treated, the first of those is that you will have high blood pressure. That can lead to blood clots, kidney issues, blindness and heart disease which are very very serious issues.\nTreatment for diabetes involves a couple of different things. First, let\u2019s look at how type two is treated. This type of disease can typically be changed with diet. The lifestyle adjustments aren\u2019t too much and are usually the best way to treat this diabetes type. Because it could be so much different than type II, often people with this type need to take a much more aggressive approach to their treatment. Depending on the person, they might also be taking injections so that their blood glucose could maintain an appropriate level.\nWhen it comes to treating this and many of these other disease it really comes down to your lifestyle.

The taper schedule should be 1/2 at the 14 day from 300 then another 50 mg at 7 day then 75 mg every 4 days. You want the taper time to be on the slow side and that can only be achieved by having less of a decline in doses at a time.

Wellwishes...\nWellbutin is a very good antidepressant medication but it is also an antinicotinic receptor agonist which means that it will help you with depression and with not smoking but will also lead to some very strange side effects like not feeling emotion. it can be taken with other SSRs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). for instance fluoxetine (Prozac) it could also be combined with serotonin norepinephrine re uptake inhibitors like Cymbalta and effexor but its best to consult your doctor for that.\nThe best thing for you to do is to discuss with a family physician, psychologist or psychiatrist about what you should do. I know I would not advise you stopping a drug that has helped to treat depression over years.\nSome doctors will just switch you from the Wellibutrin to something else like Prozac or Celexa, others will suggest you taper (as suggested in another reply) - but you have some time yet.

Just be sure to get enough sleep and food.", "Will I be able to do it alone?\nI have been on Wellbutrin XL for six months. I want to stop taking it but I do not know how. Can you advise how to decrease and come off of it?\nIt is not recommended to discontinue Wellbrutin without the doctor\u0092s approval. If this is something that you are set on doing, then you need to see your doctor and determine a plan. Sometimes people on this medication (bupropion) get symptoms of discontinuation when the drug is stopped suddenly or too rapidly. This usually involves symptoms like irritability, insomnia, poor concentration, and anxiety. These symptoms are thought to occur when there is a rebound to low levels of drug that have become less prevalent in the treatment phase. By tapering, the level of medication on board can be more gradual so it doesn\u0092t become as much of a shock and a person can come of the medication more smoothly. Tapering usually decreases the chances and severity of these symptoms. There is also information on taper schedules on the bupoprion page. However, each case is different and so I am not sure if this will help you. Also, I would discuss taper options with your physician since they would know your specific medical history.", "I've been taking it the last 4.5 days/night and woke up with nightmares last night.

And had these crazy nightmares.\nI have been feeling suicidal the whole time and this medicine does not seem to be helping with that. It does make me feel sort of spacey, in a foggy way.

Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"", "Must_have": ["Calcium supplements can be beneficial for persons diagnosed with osteoporosis as sufficient calcium intake may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.", "Alongside calcium, intake of vitamin D is also important as it aids in the absorption of calcium in the body."], "Nice_to_have": ["Magnesium, iron or zinc should be taken at a different time from calcium as these elements can interfere with calcium absorption.", "Adequate physical activity alongside a well-balanced diet including calcium and vitamin D can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life.", "Vitamin D can also be produced by skin when exposed to sufficient sunlight.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized health claims related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements."], "sample_predictions": ["I am 65 years old and have been taking calcium and magnesium for the past 10 years. I have had no problems with my bones, but I do have a problem with kidney stones. Is there a way to prevent kidney stone formation?\nCalcium is a mineral that is essential for bone health. It is also important for muscle contraction, blood clotting, nerve transmission, cell membrane function, enzyme activity, hormone secretion, vascular contraction and relaxation, heart function and blood pressure regulation. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and is found in some form in every cell. The body has a number of mechanisms to maintain adequate calcium levels in blood and tissues. When calcium intake is low, the intestines absorb more calcium, calcium is released from bone, or calcium excretion is reduced. If calcium consumption is high, excess calcium may be excreted in urine or feces. In the United States, most people consume enough calcium to meet their needs. However, some people, such as postmenopausal women, may need to take a supplement to ensure adequate intake. Magnesium is another mineral essential to bone and muscle health, as well as many other functions in your body. Like calcium it is involved in muscle and nerve function. A deficiency of either calcium or magnesium can lead to muscle cramps and spasms. Both minerals are involved with the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. They are also involved together in bone formation. While calcium supplements are often recommended for people with osteopenia or osteoprosis, magnesium supplements may also be beneficial. Some studies have shown that magnesium supplementation may help to reduce the risk of fractures in people who are at risk for osteoarthritis. There is some evidence that a combination of calcium plus magnesium may provide greater benefits than calcium alone. This is because magnesium helps the calcium be absorbed and used by the bones. Kidney stones are a common problem in our society. Most kidney and bladder stones contain calcium. Stones are more likely to form when the urine is concentrated, which can occur when you are dehydrated. Other factors that can increase the likelihood of stone development include a diet high in animal protein, low in fruits and vegetables, high salt intake, obesity, a family history of stones, certain medications and certain medical conditions. People who form calcium stones may benefit from a low calcium diet. For people at high risk, it may make sense to avoid calcium supplementation", "A study in 2016 in Thailand investigated the effects of calcium and magnesium supplementations, among other parameters, on menopausal women. Researchers found that magnesium supplementation along with calcium supplementation decreased urinary calcium losses, prevented hypertension, reduced bone turnover, increased bone formation and lowered oxidative stress parameters. The conclusion was that dietary Mg is more important than dietary Ca in the prevention of osteopenia, hypocalcemia, hypertension and bone loss in healthy menopause women in rural Thailand communities.\nA clinical study was carried out with 35 women, whose mean age was 52.3 (range 48 to 58) years. There was a control group of 10 women who maintained their normal diets, without a change in nutrition, while the study groups consisted of three groups: the calcium group took calcium 1,200 mg/day and the magnesium calcium groups had an intake of Mg 500 mg and Ca 800 mg in their respective diets.\nThe results revealed that the urinary excretion of Ca was lowest in normal woman and increased in those on the Ca and Mg+Ca supplements. Urinary Ca losses after the oral loads of the supplements showed an increase in Ca concentration in study participants in both Ca, then Ca+Mg groups. No significant changes were found in kidney function, serum Ca level, bone mineral density and blood pressure among all the groups after supplementation.\nConclusion: The Mg and calcium supplements decreased the calciuria, especially Mg supplementation, improved bone metabolism, normalized and decreased systolic blood pressures and reduced Ca oxidation.\nCalcium supplementation reduces bone resorption but does not reduce bone gain.", "Is it possible for magnesium to provide all of its health benefits, especially improved bone health, without taking calcium?\nCalcium: the Most Important Mineral In Your Bones\nOsteoporotic fractures are caused by low bone mass and bone weakness.

The ingestion of large doses of calcium in a person with magnesium deficiency could increase the hypercalcemia (high calcium level in blood) of this condition. It is known from experimental studies (1), and other sources, that oral magnesium supplements decrease serum calcium levels and increase urinary calcium excretion. Magnesium deficiency can increase calcium resorption from bone. (2) It appears that both elements influence the rate of bone resorbittion and the formation of new bone (3).\nMagnesium has a very important role in relation to the calcium ion's reaction with phosphate and adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) in order to form the most stable calcium compound known, i.e., calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHAP), that forms bones and teeth. Studies show that the presence of an adequate supply of dietary magnesium is a critical factor for bone and tooth formation (4). This calcium/phosphate/ATPL/CaHap relationship can be seen depicted in Figure 1.\nIt has been determined that in humans there is an average daily intake of 700 mg of phosporus, 1400 mg. of carbonate and hydroxide of alkaline-earth metals (Mg) (magnesium), 6000-10,000 mg, of sodium, potassium and traces of other elements and that this combination provides the raw materials (building blocks) to make 4-6 mg/day of CaHAp (5). One would think that our diet, especially if supplemented with calcium carbonate, would provide more than enough essential building blocks for the body to provide bone tissue to meet individual requirements for this highly important skeletal tissue, but it is not sufficient, according to recent studies.\nAnother very effective factor in building new CaHA bone crystals is 25-hydroxychoelciferol (calcium) which activates the 27-hyroxylation of ATP to diphosphate adenylic acid (DPADA) and this is the active factor that is important in hydrolyzing the Ca-ATPl complex to free P1 and Ca+2 to be available for Ca-HAP bonding (6).

Dr. Charles Louis Sturmer (1779-1854) was an internist at the H\u00f4pital. Jules Laurent Jean-Marie Alibert (1768-1837) practiced dermatology, ophthalmology and was the chief of service at another hospital. The two brothers independently published separate accounts in the same issue of a medical journal they shared, reporting two patients, both young adult women, with an extremely rare disease which we now know to be EDDS. Over 80 years later, Drs. Wainwright and Morquio published more information on the disease, specifically discussing the connective tissue aspect. By combining the findings of these three doctors and additional research, EDTD is now classified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which is part of the diagnostic codes for the Medicare program.\nUnfortunately, to this day, there is poor awareness in regard to EHT and diagnosis is delayed into adulthood in about 98 percent of cases. One major problem with diagnosis of Ehler\u2019s Danlos is the fact that doctors use guidelines or classifications (like ICD-9 and 10) instead of medical findings to diagnose this. We can only take into account the guidelines of those that came after the original discovery and publications of 1807. There was not nearly enough research to establish a reliable diagnosis, but with time and research as the years go on, the medical world is better able to define and establish diagnosis when Ehers Danslos and connectives tissue diseases.

Other reasons include the use of tampon, cervical polyps, and cervical cancer. Chronic cervictis can cause a lot of pain and discomfort. It can also cause fertility problems. If you are experiencing chronic inflammation of your cerviix, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. There are a few different treatments that can be used to treat chronic inflamation of cervics. Some of these treatments include antibiotics, surgery, or hormone therapy. You should talk to your doctor about which treatment is right for you.\nChlamydia is one of many sexually transmited diseases that cause chronic inflammatory of cervical. Chlamydial infection is caused by the bacterium Chlmydia trachomatis. This bacteriium is transmitted through sexual contact. Symptoms of chlamdial infections include vaginal discharge, pain during urination, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain. In women, chlmdial infeciton can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of female reproductive organs. PID can damage the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, cervis, vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, rectum, perineum. Women with PID may experience pain in the lower abdomen, back, pelvis, legs, thighs, buttocks, hips, shoulders, neck, arms, hands, feet, knees, ankles, toes, fingers, ears, nose, mouth, eyes, face, scalp, hair, skin, nails, teeth, gums, tongue, lips, cheeks, chin, jaw, throat, chest, lungs, heart, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland.

But menstrually, the tissues become dry and sensitive, to protect against the possibility of infection. The entrance of a foreign body such as a cotton or nylon tamponde, or even the menstrual absorbent cup or sponge, puts further pressure on the natural protective function of drying so as not to attract bacteria. Pain and inflammation occur.\nCan men and boys use tamonds?\nA couple of years ago, 16 young men of ages 19 to 37 were recruited to participate in a short study about the use of tamponse among men.

All the men reported discomfort with a feeling of fullness, but at the end of follow up there were no negative side effects. Another report shows one third of homosexual men use a tampone for an anal insertions with the purpose of preventing infection with hepatitis", "Also, is BV a result of vaginal inflammation?\nChronic cervictitis is essentially inflammation of the cervix. It is the most common genital tract infection of women (it is 4-5 times more common than gonorrhea) and may be asymptomatic (no symptoms ) or it can cause irritation, cervical discharge, or bleeding following intercourse. Chronic cerivctitis may make it easier for HIV to be transmitted to a normal HIV negative woman. It may also make the woman more susceptible to other sexually transmitted infections (STI)s and thus more likely to become pregnant with an STI. You should see your gynecologist and have an annual Pap smear to look for precancerous changes called cytologic changes. These changes can be treated when they occur.\nChlamydia can also be passed to another person (especially women) or the baby during birth. Also chronic cerviceitis makes a woman's cervi more vulnerable to infection, increasing her chance of having a baby with a low birth weight. She is also more suscepibale to abnormal cervical changes and possibly cervical cancer.\nA cervicogram is used to detect cervical abnormalities such as a \"coning\" of th cervis with cervical narrowing and this may affect pregnancy.\nYou may get infections such a pelvic inflammatory diseases.\nTampons don't cause cervcitis, but they can irritate the vagina and worsen vaginal discharge and can make you more susceptibe to infections.\nMost forms of BV are caused by bacteria. Other possible causes include:\nAn imbalance of bacteria in your vagina ( dysbiosis)\nA new sexual partner or an increase in sexual activity\nNot regularly changing tampon s or toilet paper\nSome contraceptives (like diaphragms and spermicide s.\nPregnancy and menopause.\nThere are also BV that are not sexually transmited.

For this, they damage cells by viruses.\nThe female body secretes a special liquid from each of its cervical glands, namely cervical mucus. This liquid makes up between 70 to 75% of what comes out of our falopian tubes. Mucus contains the protein which is responsible for the fertility of that man's sperms that fertilize the female\u2019s egg.\nMucus is watery in the follicular phase, thick at times of ovulation, liquid during implantation, etc.\nThis cervical fluid causes the spern from male to enter inside the woman\u2019s sex organs and reach the egg and fertilizes it.\nA study has shown in a healthy woman that she starts producing thick mucas even before she knows she is ovulating, but this mucs doesnot allow the semen to pass easily and therefore, it is a waste of semen. A number of studies have shown that this is not the case for women with inflammation or those not ovulate. The muen of women who do not have cervical infections does allow sperns to quickly enter.\nNow let`s look at the changes that the inflammation causes in sperminfection.\nHere is an extract from one of my research articles\nEffects of cervical inflammation on sperm\nIn women, inflammation often occurs in combination with a bacterium called Chlamydia. It happens that 25% to over 80 percent of sperm may be infected. More than 90% were infected when inflammation was caused by the bacterioma.\nSince Chiamydidia grows in and inflames the uterine tissue, sperm can be quickly killed in its uteral tissue. Even after sperm infection has spread to semen, infections occur in semen which can then pass to a female's uterus during intercourse.\nEffects on fertility because of changes during menses.\nIt often happens", "What are your favorite tips?\nCervicitistis is an infection anywhere along the cervix, which is the entry way to the uterus. It can usually be treated with antibiotics, but sometimes it requires gynecological evaluation.\nWhile any infection of the reproductive organs can be painful, especially if it lasts more than a month, most infections do not lead to infertility.\nAs for tampon use, it's better to use them and change them frequently to prevent yeast infections which, again, can sometimes lead intractable endometritis. Use is not associated in any way with cervical infection.\nIt is recommended that tampos be used sparingly as they can cause infections especially with improper hygeine with it\u2019s use.

Your gynocologist will be able to advise you or refer you to a fertility specialist if these issues persist\nFirst, a brief anatomy lesson. Cervical tissue has an inner layer, the endocervix or epithelial layer that gets damaged by infections and tampond use and an outer layer which does not. When there is chronic inflammation, cervical polyps may develop. These polyp are not cancerous but can have abnormal cytology, meaning that they have an abnormal tissue consistency and when abnormal, this tissue is seen frequently in pre-malignant disease of gynaecologic organs.\nCancer and precancers can often look very similar on a Pap test, and only tissue exam (ie biopsy) can make the definitive diagnosis. There are two main precursors to cervical cancer - abnormal pap tests, or abnormal polypep tests. In order to get a", "What tests are there for bacterial vaginosis?

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["I have a friend who has it and I want to help her.\nTrisomies are genetic disorders that occur when a person has three copies of a chromosome instead of the normal two. Trisomes 13, 18, and 21 are the most common trismies. The most severe trismsies, such as trimsomy-13 and trismus-18 are usually fatal in the first year of life. However, trissomy seven is not as severe and is usually not fatal. It is a rare disorder that is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 17. This extra chromosome causes the cells to divide and grow at a faster rate than normal. As a result, the person with trissy seven may have an increased risk of developing cancer. There is no cure for trisy seven, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms. These treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of these treatments.", "Is it likely to develop from the mother?\nTrisomies are medical conditions in which the cells have three chromosomes in place of two in a set. In the case of trismomy-7, the third chromosome is an extra copy of the chromosome 5. The medical condition is referred to as trissomy because the condition affects the whole body.\nThe most serious condition the problem can cause is cancer. However, this is not guaranteed even if the patient has the extra chromosome. If a patient does have that complication, they will have a much better chance of survival than if they had a normal number of chromosomes. Trisemy is more likely, though not certain, to be inherited from parents than the general population.\nTreatments should only address any problems that arise while having the additional copy, if any.", "Is it a chromosomal abnormality like Klinefelter?s or Turner?s?\nTrisomies are caused by extra copies of the genetic material in a cell in which there would normally be two copies. They usually occur when chromosomes separate incorrectly during the development of sperm or ova in either the mother or father. For example, trismus 21, or Down?s syndrome, is caused when there are three copies instead of two on a chromosome (23). Sometimes trismies occur in the cells of organs after they are developed. I was told that they can cause cell death in some organs, including the liver, and also cause inflammation, which may lead to cirrhosis (hardening) of some of those cells. However, they do not occur to the same extent in all of an individual's cells; so it must always be determined if the abnormalities would cause any problems for that person. The first question for this scenario would be to ask why his liver enzyme tests have come back abnormal. We would consider a genetic cause of cirrho\u00acsis, but these would not be consistent with a trissamy that affected all his cells, as he seems to be able to lead an independent life. These kinds of symptoms are more suggestive of a medical and/or environmental cause that has affected his organs and not just his genetic makeup. He should, however, be given a full genetic workup to rule this out. As of yet, there is no treatment that is specifically available that would cure people with trismsies. Of course, if an organ is affected by a disorder caused from a specific genetic defect, then we would find a way of compensating for its effects. In your husband's case, a liver transplant may be an option if he does not respond to treatment to compensate for his problem (i.e., the use of medications, herbal remedies, etc.).", "I recently diagnosed with trsomy and I am curious to know how it works.\nTrisomies refer to having an additional chromosome in every cell instead of the usual two chromosomes (one from each parent) in an individual.

Other drugs in their class also treat other Diabetes-related conditions, including thyroid dysfunction and high uric acid levels in people with gout. The drug is also sometimes prescribed for individuals who have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\nThe primary active ingredient in metforms is Glimepiride. It has been used for many years and is often given to patients with high LDL (low-density lipoprotein or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels. Although these medications are widely available, physicians often prescribe them for patients who want to know whether they have PCOS or metabolic disorder without them having a chance to develop it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. This would be an early way to detect potential problems before they become too severe to be treated easily.\nThis article will discuss the question \u201cdoes met-formin raise blood sugar?\u201d and how it affects blood sugars.\nDoes Metformine Cause High Blood Pressure?\nYes! Metforms can cause an increase in blood-sugar levels if you take them regularly. Even though they do not usually produce any symptoms, they can still cause some issues among patients. For instance, some people experience an elevation in LDL cholesterol after taking metiformin.\nWhat Is Met-form?\nMet-form is an oral drug taken by mouth. Its effects are mostly in the liver because it increases the amount of insulin you produce. Insulin helps regulate blood glucose levels.\nWhen you have diabetes, your pancreas cannot make enough insulin, so even if your body releases extra from the pancreatic gland, it cannot use all of it to regulate glucose. Metfordin works best when your blood-glucose levels are relatively low.\nIt comes in two forms: pills and capsules. You can purchase both forms at any pharmacy or retail store under the brand name Januvia. However, the pills contain more active ingredients than the capsules, which makes them more potent.\nThe pills cost nearly twice as much as the capsule versions, but they might be what you need if sugar intolerance is severe or other medications cannot help lower your glucose level.\nMetforms (sometimes abbreviated as \u201cMet\u201d) are among the most popular OTC Osteoporosis Drugs because they lower bone mineral density by stimulating bone growth. Bone mineral content is the volume of bone tissue", "\u2013 Metformi.noplagged.online\nI have read that the Met-form contains a small quantity of sugar, but this has been shown to be untrue by various scientific studies. If your doctor says you can drink Met, you should drink the appropriate amount for your weight. The amount of alcohol tolerated by one person might be more than enough for another. Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. In some people, Met can cause diarrhoea. This is because Met inhibits a chemical in the intestines called sodium-glucose cotransporter. That is why you have to drink lots of fluids. Met shouldn\u2019t really cause constipation. However, it can make you feel bloated, gassy or nauseous. It has also been known to cause headaches. You should stop taking Met form if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. Your doctor will advise you not to take it until you\u2019re at least 19 weeks pregnant, or to discuss it with him.\nI am wondering if anyone knows how much is too much Met (metformen). Should I reduce or increase it? Is Met really a safe drug for the body? Please tell me your thoughts. I know for a fact that this drug is FDA approved for treating obesity and can lead to cardiovascular disease. Do you know anyone who has taken it?\nI\u2019ve had Met for 8 months and it really isn\u2019t helping\u2026or is it working but I think it just didn\u2019t feel great\u2026 I was fine at first but then the side effects really kicked in.

There are no clinical trials that show how Met affects people. Some of the evidence we do have shows that Met may cause a few heart problems like arrhythmia or tachycardia (rapid heartbeat). However it is not clear whether Met has an effect on our heart, or whether it does anything for our blood sugar. So many studies are inconclusive, especially as to whether or not Met causes weight gain. Despite its apparent ability to lower blood glucose levels to normal and improve glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, there is a big variation in how effective Met is. But if Met helps us lose weight, that could make it more appealing for people who are morbidly obese.

Why is nicotine so addictive?", "What are other health complications that can occur in digestive organs as a result of long or short term smoking?\nThe first known cause is that digestive enzyme production may suffer due to a substance present in cigarette smoke called acrolein. This substance affects the ability for our body to produce several different enzymes: pepsinogen (stomach), trypsinogen, amylase (intestines) and alpha-glucosidase. Additionally, long term smokers can suffer from constipation, or frequent diarrhea in cases of nicotine addiction.

And although nicotine doesn't appear to directly cause cancer, the damage it causes to cells may make it easier for cancer to develop. This is because the nicotine activates a protein called epidermal growth factor, which is involved in the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.\nIn an opinion piece in American Giver, Dr Kevin T. Wright, president of the National Institute for Tobacco-Free Kids, stated, \"A recent study suggests a link with cigarettes containing higher levels of one of those cancer-causing chemicals. We need further research to clarify this, but no current evidence suggests that e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes.\"\nSmoking also causes gum disease, an ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease and, rarely, stomach perforation and ulcerated or bleeding masses, he said.\nMost smokers know that smoking affects lung function, so they often mistakenly think digestive problems like reflux and constipation are not linked to smoking. But in truth, these are also related to cigarette smoking.\nWhen nicotine is smoked, it reaches the stomach and is absorbed into the bloodstream, then carried to the brain to create the feeling of relaxation people get from smoking - a feeling that has become an addiction for many people.\n\"In the process of absorbing into your bloodstream,\" Kumar said, \u201cthe walls of your stomach get damaged, giving rise to stomach ulcer and gastritis, as well as vomiting.\"\nNicotine also prevents the food you eat from moving properly down the esophagus, thus causing acid reflux, heartburn and esophagealis ulcer.\nNicotene also can create ulcers. \"Most of us know someone who has suffered from ulsers. The causes can be due to stress or bacteria, or sometimes due both,\" he explained. Nicotine can", "I\u2019ve been a two-year heavy smoker and feel the urge to smoke because my abdomen is sore. The doctor says the problem is unrelated but I\u2019m not really sure. What is your view?\nYour concern about nicotine affecting the functioning of the stomach may not be completely unfounded, especially if you have been smoking heavily over a long period of time.\nAlthough nicotine itself has been shown to relax the esophagus (the tube leading from the throat to the abdomen), it is not the primary cause of ulcers. I suspect that the \u201culcer-like\u201d pain that you report isn\u2019t really an ulcer but one of several reasons for abdominal pain other than ulcer and that smoking would have probably been unrelated to this condition.\nI suggest that if your doctor has told you that nothing abnormal is going on with your stomach, you accept that and stop worrying. You may have irritable bowel syndrome, a very common condition. Or your problem may be a gall bladder attack. In any case, your primary concern should be to focus on stopping your smoking before you find it has caused other ailments that will be more serious.", "How could one use their understanding\u00a0of the effect of nicotine\u00a0to educate people about the dangers of tobacco use?\u00a0\u00a0 Discuss a real life\u00a0scenario that could lead to a need for immediate action.\u00a0 Be very specific.\nThe digestive systems of smokers has a significantly slower digestion processes, due to the chemicals and toxins that get into the blood stream from the tar and nicotine.

Smoking also causes inflammation of pancreatic tissues; this leads to indigestion. People might go longer periods without regular bowel movements due the decreased movement (peristaltic action) throughout the system.

A typical smoker's bowel movement could take anywhere between three to thirty minutes. The more cigarettes smoked by a person, the quicker the movement usually is. When a nicotine addict stops smoking, it is very likely that he would suffer from constipation as his digestive tract adjusts itself. In the long-term, a smoker usually suffers from chronic constipations. One can observe more instances of rectal problems due to smoking habit like haemorrhoids, rectangular fissure, mucosal prolapse etc. Smoking also causes spasm of the gall-bladder in some cases. Expectorant drinks and other tobacco ingredients irritate the stomach and make it acidic. This causes the secretion of hydrochloric acid which causes stomach ulceration. So, regular intake of antacids is also a common side-effect of smokers. Long term studies show that smokers have a higher chance of suffering from ulcers and duodenal ulsters than non-smokers.

Rather, patients who have fibro may experience joint swelling as a result of other disorders such as arthritis. Read all about it below.\nFibromaligia is a chronic disorder commonly experienced as widespread pain throughout the muscles. Fibro patients typically experience symptoms more often in the neck, torso, arms, and legs, but these areas are not the only areas which may be involved.\nCan Fibrolmalgia Cause Swelling\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, swelling (also known as edema) is caused by fluid accumulation in bodily tissues. The swelling may appear as fullness, tightness or bloating. These symptoms may occur in any area, including the arms and fingers, legs and toes, or under the skin of the face, neck or abdomen. In some cases of medical conditions such ad fibronyalagin, inflammation may cause a patient to feel swollen but this swelling will simply be the result swelling related to inflammation, not an excess of fluid.\nOther symptoms of inflammation include joint stiffness and pain which is often accompanied by a dull, aching feeling. Additionally, the affected areas may feel warm to touch.\nWhile it is possible for fibroyalagics to experience swelling of tissues as the body fights an infection, it\u2019s unlikely that swelling on its own is the sign of an emerging or developing condition. Still, if you notice swelling, pain, redness and warmth all at once, be sure to seek the advice of your fibraligic doctor immediately.\nIt is especially important to do your own investigation into the cause of symptoms, especially if your health has taken a turn for the worse. Most often, there is likely nothing to worry about. That said, symptoms should never be taken lightly. If the pain and discomfort from swelling persist and do not improve within a week or so, seek medical attention immediately. As mentioned earlier, you may need medical intervention such and a steroid solution or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to get a jump start on the swelling process.\nArthritis-Related Joint Swellng and Fibryoaliga\nThe Mayo clinic goes on to say, that many fibrolagica patients will experience inflammatory swelling from another disorder or disease. Arthritis is an excellent example of a condition which causes widespread joint pain as well as inflammation. A 2015 study published by Osteoarthritis and Cartilage found that rheumatoid joint conditions and fib", "Or does the swelling cause pain as part of Fibro symptoms? Fibrous Tissue Syndrome is sometimes associated with swelling but the two are not necessarily related. I will discuss the cause of swelling and how Fibrosis Symptoms can affect your life in this blog post.\nFirstly let us look at the reasons why you may be suffering from swelling. There are many factors which will affect blood flow in an individual. Factors ranging from poor circulation and inflammation to the effects of injury or disease. The following factors are among the most common reasons for swelling.\nSwelling is often accompanied by pain and redness. Swollen tissue results from the accumulation of fluid in the tissues and may also cause muscle pain. Most often the pain associated is the result of overexertion. This happens when a muscle is put under excess tension, such as when you are lifting something or playing sports.\nMuscle spasticity is another common cause for swollen muscles. It happens because muscle fibers contract when they are fatigued. In fact, in most cases that this happens, there is no blood or fluid to help ease the strain on the muscles.\nAn inflammation of the muscle can also result in swelling of that particular area. If your doctor prescribes anti-inflammatory medicines, it will help stop the inflammation and help reduce the overall amount of pain you experience.\nWhen inflammation becomes chronic it can lead to other types of disorders such a fibrotic tissue disease which can be treated with medications and lifestyle changes.\nMany times an inflammation in a particular part is brought on by a bacterial infection that causes the bacteria to multiply in that area.\nIn order to prevent future occurrences of an infection, the patient should practice good hygiene, use a good quality deodorant and avoid touching the area where the skin irritation is occurring.\nOther diseases that can cause the body to swell, for instance cancer or diabetes. These types are usually referred to as \u201cFever and Chills.\u201d The blood is thickened in patients with these illnesses and can sometimes cause blood vessels to leak.\nThis can manifest itself as swelling, a skin rash, an induration, fever, chills and the presence of skin sores, warts and cysts.\nAnother condition that may cause body swelling is called \u201cfibrotomy.\u201d It occurs when damaged tissue and muscle cannot be repaired, leaving the affected area \u201cdead skin.\u201d\nThis causes swelling throughout the entire body and an increase in temperature, sweating and chaffing beneath the breasts.\nIt is important to consult with a", "Well, no studies have been completed to determine if fibromylagia can cause edema, or swelling. But many fibro-sufferers report that they have this symptom regularly.\nEdema is a swollen and or stiff condition that causes the skin to look swollen. This condition can happen in any part of your bod\u2026y but can also occur in specific parts of the body.\nFor example, you may notice your feet, hands, legs, and other body areas are swelling when there is too much fluid in them. The cause of this may be due to fibomyalgia, diabetes, pregnancy, heart, kidney, liver, blood clotting conditions, medications, thyroid problems, atherosclerosis, cirrhosis, lymphatic issues, venous insufficiency, injury, burns, radiation, obesity, overwork, etc.\nThe swelling of any of these body parts can be a sign of too little or too many red blood cells, white blood cell count, low or high protein levels, dehydration, infection, anemia, lung disorders, high cholesterol, hormonal imbalance, hypothyroid, stress, adrenal problems and/or fibryomyaydia.\nFibromyaylia is not a contagious disease, but it may cause someone close to you to become ill if they catch your cold or flu.\nI am writing about this issue due in part to the fact that I have experienced the problem of fibroyalgic edemas myself and I would like to share my experiences in order to help other sufferers of edemasy myalgias understand the nature of their illnesses and how to get over them.\nSymptoms and Causes of Edema:\nThe symptoms of firomyalgics caused by edemos are similar to those caused with any other type of tissue, i.e., they usually affect one or more extremities such as the face, feet or legs. However, there may also be swelling around the neck or other major organs such s the kidneys. In most cases, the swelling is temporary and goes away as soon as edeme is corrected.\nOther possible symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, itching of different body regions, headaches, shortness of breath, joint pain and stiffness.\nIn some cases these symptoms may occur when people have an underlying illness or condition. As mentioned above, fayomyalga can trigger the condition.\nAlthough firiomyalis and edomas are the most common causes, they are not the only two conditions to cause fib", "Fibomyalgia may not create swelling, but the pain can be worse.\nSo why do so many with fibromylgia get swelling?\nWhile it could be from stress or another health problem with joint pain, it is most probable due to the high amounts of steroid medication you are taking.\nHigh amounts, because steroid medications are used for many health issues that affect the joints and muscles; including pain in the muscles and joints that are caused from an overuse injury.\nIf you use steroids that cause high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, swelling can also be a side effect.\nCan your pain from fibomylagia cause Swelling?\nYes, your fibro pain and swelling are tied to each other. Swollen joints may feel like they are on fire. You can\u2019t move due the excruciating pain.\nTo help alleviate fibomyalga pain you need to relax and stretch frequently during the day.\nWhen you get a sharp pain or stiffness, place hot or cold packs on the affected areas to help the swelling and pain. Also, ice your joints after activity to assist with the muscle pain that causes swelling.\nWhile swimming is a great idea, there are many more activities that will be better for you and your muscles.\nYou can use a tennis ball to target specific areas of your hips, legs and feet.\nStand on your feet that have the tennis balls in them, and move as you apply pressure with each move. In a few minutes, you should notice more mobility and flexibility as the tension and tightness of muscles loosens up.\nThe tennis movement may sound like it isn\u2019t a beneficial way to deal with your swelling pain caused by fibo, however it works. The muscles that tighten and contract under your skin are the reason for swelling. When you massage the area with a ball or roll your foot or leg to stretch the tight and sore muscles, the blood flow returns to that area and the swollen tissues are brought back to normal.\nMassage a sore muscle to keep it from becoming an issue. By not dealing with sore areas when swollen in joints, tight muscles can stay contracted and worsen over time.\nHow to Know When Fibro is Causing Swells?\nWhen a fibroid tumor grows and creates intense pain to your uterus, ovaries, bowels, bladder, blood vessels or the walls of nearby intestines, this is known as fibroids which can cause intense swelling to nearby organs.\nIt is important to learn to identify these symptoms as it can lead to"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4419, "rouge1_r": 0.047, "rouge1_f1": 0.085, "rouge2_p": 0.1667, "rouge2_r": 0.0174, "rouge2_f1": 0.0315, "rougel_p": 0.3256, "rougel_r": 0.0347, "rougel_f1": 0.0626, "bleurt": 0.3676, "bert_score_p": 0.8065, "bert_score_r": 0.8609, "bert_score_f1": 0.8328, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.084}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5116, "rouge1_r": 0.0571, "rouge1_f1": 0.1028, "rouge2_p": 0.1667, "rouge2_r": 0.0182, "rouge2_f1": 0.0329, "rougel_p": 0.4419, "rougel_r": 0.0494, "rougel_f1": 0.0888, "bleurt": 0.3161, "bert_score_p": 0.7966, "bert_score_r": 0.8619, "bert_score_f1": 0.828, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0845}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.4884, "rouge1_r": 0.0532, "rouge1_f1": 0.0959, "rouge2_p": 0.1667, "rouge2_r": 0.0178, "rouge2_f1": 0.0321, "rougel_p": 0.3023, "rougel_r": 0.0329, "rougel_f1": 0.0594, "bleurt": 0.3281, "bert_score_p": 0.7986, "bert_score_r": 0.8744, "bert_score_f1": 0.8348, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0831}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4419, "rouge1_r": 0.0448, "rouge1_f1": 0.0814, "rouge2_p": 0.1429, "rouge2_r": 0.0142, "rouge2_f1": 0.0258, "rougel_p": 0.3256, "rougel_r": 0.033, "rougel_f1": 0.06, "bleurt": 0.3251, "bert_score_p": 0.8031, "bert_score_r": 0.8531, "bert_score_f1": 0.8273, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0745}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.5116, "rouge1_r": 0.059, "rouge1_f1": 0.1058, "rouge2_p": 0.119, "rouge2_r": 0.0134, "rouge2_f1": 0.0242, "rougel_p": 0.3023, "rougel_r": 0.0349, "rougel_f1": 0.0625, "bleurt": 0.3523, "bert_score_p": 0.7953, "bert_score_r": 0.8699, "bert_score_f1": 0.831, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.092}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.5814, "rouge1_r": 0.0588, "rouge1_f1": 0.1068, "rouge2_p": 0.119, "rouge2_r": 0.0118, "rouge2_f1": 0.0215, "rougel_p": 0.3256, "rougel_r": 0.0329, "rougel_f1": 0.0598, "bleurt": 0.3235, "bert_score_p": 0.8025, "bert_score_r": 0.8634, "bert_score_f1": 0.8319, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0854}]}

It\u2019s a scary diagnosis, and it\u2019s one that many people are afraid to talk about. But what if I told you that there\u2019s something you can do to help prevent cancer? And what\u2019s more, it doesn\u2019t involve any drugs or surgery. In fact, all you need to do is change your diet. That\u2019s right \u2014 eating the right foods can help reduce your risk of developing cancer. And in this article, I\u2019m going to show you exactly how to eat to prevent and even reverse cancer.\nCancers are diseases that occur when cells in the body grow out of control. They can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancer). Benign tumors don\u2019t spread to other parts of the bod y, while malignant tumors do. There are many different types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer. The most common type of breast cancers are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive duct carcinoma (IDC). DCIS is the earliest stage of invasive breast carcinoma, where the cancer cells are confined to the milk ducts. IDC is when the tumor has spread beyond the duct and into the surrounding tissue.\nHow Does Cancer Spread?\nCarcinogens are substances that cause cancer in humans. These include chemicals, radiation and viruses. Carcinogens can enter the bloodstream through the skin, lungs, digestive tract or other routes. Once inside the blood, they travel throughout the entire body. This is why cancer can spread from one part of your body to another. For example, if you have lung or breast tumors, the cells from those tumors can travel through your bloodstream and settle in other areas of our body, such as the brain or bones.\nWhat Causes Cancer?\nThere are several factors that contribute to cancer development. Some of these include:\nGenetics: Some people inherit genes that make them more likely to develop certain types that are more common in their family.\nDiet: Eating too much red meat, processed meats, refined grains, sugary drinks and alcohol can increase your chances of getting cancer.\nSmoking: Smoking cigarettes increases your chance of lung, throat, mouth, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, cervix, ovary, testicle, prostate, skin and other cancers.\nExposure to radiation: Exposure to high levels of radiation can cause damage to DNA, which can", "Yes, this is a fact. Cancer spread by blood can cause complications at any time, from the time of blood transfusion, as well as after transplantation. And the tumor may not only spread in a blood test, but there are cases when the blood metastasis caused the formation of solid metastases.\nHow cancer spreads through the veins. Ways\nA malignant tumor, due to its heterogeneity, can at one time to grow in various tissues, to break away from them and begin to move in the lymph or blood by different routes. The direction of cancer from one organ through any other place, where the body has a single circulatory system, leads to the inevitable penetration into the bloodstream or lymph, since the circulation system always moves to a common exit.\nMetastases from cancer in blood is possible in two ways:\nThe spread of metastatic cancer cells to one place through other places where metastasized tumor cells have settled\nTransferred metastatized cancer into a new place by means of a carrier, usually a red blood cell or a white blood cells. White blood, having a phagocytic function, often carries cancerous cells from place to place.\nWhat blood cancer treatment. Types of diseases\nFor the development of the disease, it is not enough just to spread the cancer through various lymphatics and blood. It is necessary that the person is ill with cancer. As a rare exception, the situation may be when a person receives blood from a donor who carried the metastazing tumor. This may cause in him an oncological disease that is already formed in another person. Such cases are extremely rare, while the donor is almost always not an indicator of an illness that has appeared, not the origin. So how can cancer happen when blood donors are not a cancer patient?\nHow can you get cancer of different tissues? We consider.\nSo, cancer can spread like this. Through the entire circulations system. Only a very small amount of patients who have undergone blood surgery or have received blood of one way or another at the right time. But there is another way of \"spreading\" cancer: if a tumor appears in tissues and organs of various, different organs, such as ovaries, uterus and liver, then such cancers occur. That the tumors spread from organ to organ, in these cases there must be an intermediate carrier of malignant cells that will carry a malignant cell in our case from an organ into another organ.\nA tumor that spreads to organs through capillaries is called metastazising", "I would like to hear all of your comments on the subject. I am asking out of curiosity.\nCan breast cancer move to the lungs?", "What about breast milk?\nYou often hear about people getting hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV or other viruses from contaminated medical products. And in the United States, more and more people are contracting hepatitis from tainted injections of prescription medicines. But there are some diseases for which transmission to others through contaminated syringes and other medical tools is quite rare.\nOne of these very rare transmissions is cancer. It is almost unheard of for anyone to contract a cancer from used medical needles or syringe, unless it is from your doctor's negligence. In these cases, the doctor may be criminally charged with criminal negligence, in addition to medical liability. (Click to learn more)\nBecause it was very unlikely that Ms. Taylor had contracted her disease from a contaminated hospital product, doctors suspected that the disease may have occurred naturally. At most, it seemed a bizarre, and quite unlucky, coincidence. However, further investigation revealed that over the previous three years, there had been a high incidence of non-Hodkins lymphoma in patients who had received chemotherapy infusions in her hospital. These chemotherapy drugs were administered through the same kind of needle used to draw blood from patients. Furthermore, several of the cancer patients reported getting blood back when the needle was being cleaned after they'd been given their dose of chemo. All of this suggested that contaminated needles were what was causing the spike in cancer cases.\nAll doctors in such settings should ensure they are fully trained in correct practices for disposing of used needles and syriges, as well as how to clean them before giving another patient an injection. Blood banks that take blood for transfusions must also take care to dispose of needles properly so they don't spread cancer.\nHowever, you don\u2019t need to worry about contracting cancer this way very often. The risk is, statistically, essentially nonexistent.\nIn terms of breast-feeding, when a mother breast-feeds, she releases a hormone called prolactin into her milk. Prolactation is found in very high concentrations in women with breast cancer, with about one-quarter of all breast cancers having been linked to high prolactive levels. There have been cases showing high rates of prolative in infants who have a breastfeeding cancer in their mother, however, this is also very, very unusual, especially in cases in which the mother is taking hormone replacement therapy while breastfeeding.\nIf you have questions or concerns about the potential of contracting a disease through medical testing, surgical equipment, or needles, click here for a consultation with a professional and trusted lawyer.", "This is a question that people ask with regard to different types of cancer. Many experts say that it is possible for cancer to spread when a person comes in contact with blood from a cancer patient.\nAccording to scientific sources, cancer can be spread this way. Blood transfusions seem to be the most common way that cancer spreads. It is even possible that some cancers can spread with a mere blood transfer between two people.\nScientific journals suggest that this is rare, but it can happen. If a patient is going to undergo heart surgery that requires a transfusion, they might ask that the blood have no cancer cells prior to the procedure. However, this request can sometimes be too expensive or be unavailable.\nMany people are asking whether it's possible to stop cancer before it starts.\u00a0 Research \u00a0suggests a certain vegetable helps to kill cancer \u2013 and even reduce existing tumors.", "I know it was in the past, where people were pricked by a needle of a person. It was the disease that spread that way. But now this is highly unlikely and the doctors will give a vaccine to that person to ensure there is no contamination, etc. I have read that it spread a long time ago, like blood transfusions.\nIf you can get me information that is more recent about this, that would be more helpful.\nThere should not be any direct transmission of cancer through contact with another person (unless you are a close family member and you share DNA for example). Most cancer is not contagious.\nBlood donation centers provide some very stringent screening measures in place that helps to avoid the transmission.\nFrom the American Red Cross website on Blood Donations:\nBlood is also a potential mode of transmission when a cancerous tumour or cells break off and enter the patient\u2019s bloodstream or tissues, such as the lymph nodes. Transfusing whole blood or infected cell components from a donor to a patient may result in transmission if the donor has blood circulating through him/her from an undetected cancer. This can only happen where whole-blood donations are the norm. The risk is much greater where platelet, plasma or packed red-cell donations predominate because these fractions are removed more frequently from donors with tumours than whole-bowel donations.\nThis is usually known as \"passive\" transmission because it occurs when blood (such as whole donor blood, blood components, or contaminated blood products) is transferred from one person into another, rather than \"active\" transfer (e.g. through needle-sharing behaviour) from infected donor via transfusion to the susceptible individual.\nPassive blood-borne transmission includes diseases caused by:\n  1. viruses: (Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)), human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )\n  -and retroviruses (Human T-lymphotropic virus type 3 (HTLV-3)) \n 2. mycobacteria or bacteria \n( Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Myo. bovis, Brucella species, Yersinia enter-colitica)  and  \n  bacteria (Helicobacter pylori)\n  --   - Bacterial  Leptospirosis\n  In addition, these diseases are not considered to be passively transmitted in whole donated blood: diphtheria, malaria, viral encephalitis, poliomyelitis and paralytic states of the central nervous system."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4615, "rouge1_r": 0.0449, "rouge1_f1": 0.0818, "rouge2_p": 0.0789, "rouge2_r": 0.0075, "rouge2_f1": 0.0137, "rougel_p": 0.359, "rougel_r": 0.0349, "rougel_f1": 0.0636, "bleurt": 0.3475, "bert_score_p": 0.7892, "bert_score_r": 0.8382, "bert_score_f1": 0.8129, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.0744}, {"idx": 1, "rouge1_p": 0.5641, "rouge1_r": 0.0518, "rouge1_f1": 0.0948, "rouge2_p": 0.1053, "rouge2_r": 0.0094, "rouge2_f1": 0.0173, "rougel_p": 0.359, "rougel_r": 0.0329, "rougel_f1": 0.0603, "bleurt": 0.3538, "bert_score_p": 0.7846, "bert_score_r": 0.8365, "bert_score_f1": 0.8097, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0718}, {"idx": 2, "rouge1_p": 0.1282, "rouge1_r": 0.2, "rouge1_f1": 0.1562, "rouge2_p": 0.0, "rouge2_r": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.0, "rougel_p": 0.1282, "rougel_r": 0.2, "rougel_f1": 0.1562, "bleurt": 0.2527, "bert_score_p": 0.8649, "bert_score_r": 0.827, "bert_score_f1": 0.8456, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.267}, {"idx": 3, "rouge1_p": 0.4615, "rouge1_r": 0.0418, "rouge1_f1": 0.0766, "rouge2_p": 0.0789, "rouge2_r": 0.007, "rouge2_f1": 0.0128, "rougel_p": 0.3077, "rougel_r": 0.0278, "rougel_f1": 0.0511, "bleurt": 0.2907, "bert_score_p": 0.7883, "bert_score_r": 0.839, "bert_score_f1": 0.8128, "hallucination": 100.0, "comprehensive": 0.0, "fluency": 0.0661}, {"idx": 4, "rouge1_p": 0.3846, "rouge1_r": 0.098, "rouge1_f1": 0.1563, "rouge2_p": 0.0263, "rouge2_r": 0.0066, "rouge2_f1": 0.0105, "rougel_p": 0.2564, "rougel_r": 0.0654, "rougel_f1": 0.1042, "bleurt": 0.325, "bert_score_p": 0.8352, "bert_score_r": 0.8497, "bert_score_f1": 0.8424, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1669}, {"idx": 5, "rouge1_p": 0.641, "rouge1_r": 0.0696, "rouge1_f1": 0.1256, "rouge2_p": 0.1316, "rouge2_r": 0.014, "rouge2_f1": 0.0253, "rougel_p": 0.4103, "rougel_r": 0.0446, "rougel_f1": 0.0804, "bleurt": 0.3333, "bert_score_p": 0.7737, "bert_score_r": 0.8544, "bert_score_f1": 0.8121, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0795}]}

Weinert, DPM, FACFAS, a podiatrist in the Chicago area, explains the condition and its treatment.\nPlantar fasciitis is a condition that causes pain in your heel. It is caused by inflammation of the plantarfascia, which is the thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of your foot. The plantafasciia supports the arch ofyour foot and helps to absorb shock when you walk or run. If the tissue becomes inflamed, it can cause pain and stiffness inyour heel.\nThere are several things that can contribute to plantars fasciaitis. Wearing shoes that do not provide enough support can put strain on the fascial tissue. Being overweight can also put extra pressure on your feet, leading to inflammation. And, if you have flat feet or high arches, you may be more likely to develop planters fascitis.\nIf you think you might have plantafs fascitiis, the first thing you should do is see a doctor. They will be able to diagnose the problem and recommend treatment options. Treatment for plantfascitis typically includes rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), and over-the-counter pain relievers. In some cases, your doctor may also recommend physical therapy or custom orthotics to help support your arch and reduce pressureon the affected area.\nIn severe cases of plantfar fascititis surgery maybe necessary to release the tight tissue and relieve pain. However, this is usually only considered as a last resort after other treatments have failed.\nWhat are the symptoms of Plantar Fasciitiitis?\nThe most common symptom of planfarf fasciiitisis painin the heel or archof the foot, especially when first getting out of bed in themorning or after sitting for long periods of time. Other symptoms may include stiffness, swelling, or tenderness inthe heel area. You mayalso notice a popping or cracking sound whenyou walk, as well as difficulty walking or standing for extended periods.\nHow is Plantarf Fasciiitiitreated?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all treatment for planfarsfasciiitis; however, there are some general guidelines that yourdoctor may follow. Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation ( RICE ) is often recommended as the initial treatmentfor plantffasciiitiiis. This involves resting theaffected foot as much as possible, applying icepacks to the area for 15", "Here\u2019s an in-depth look at what causes the condition and its symptoms, as well as treatment options.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain, which can be caused by an injury or a chronic, long-term issue. Plantar faciatis is an inflammation of the plantra fascia, the tissue that connect your foot bones to the heel. If you experience pain in your heels on the bottom of your feet, it can make walking and standing uncomfortable and difficult. This pain also often occurs first thing when you wake up.\nPlantara fascialis is the most common form of plantara heelpain. It\u2019s most often caused from overstretching or straining the foot. Some other possible causes of this type of foot pain include: standing and walking on hard surfaces, walking barefoot on concrete, shoes that are high heeled, tight calf and hamstring muscles, obesity, or wearing athletic shoes with improper arch support or cushioning. The condition is most commonly seen in overweight people, pregnant women, runners, those who spend lots of time on their feet in their line of work (such as nurses) or in older individuals.\nThere are both surgery and non-surgical treatment alternatives for plantaria fascialus. Surgery can include things like extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESL), arthroscopic surgery, nerve block injections, etc. However, non-invasive treatments such as orthotics, stretching and massage, wearing properly fitted, properly cushioned footwear with a heel drop, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, icing and resting, weight loss and changing activities can also greatly assist with this condition.\nWhen you visit a podiatrist, they will ask you about the area where you feel the pain. You will also be asked to lift your heal, walk around while they observe your gait, sit down on a stool with the stool touching the back of a chair, kneel on one knee with both feet together, roll your ankle out, bend your knees while keeping your toes flexed, then bend the knees again, turn around and point your toe down while extending your leg, take a step sideways, twist your body around, bring your right foot over your left foot, do 10 repetitions of each ankle movement, stand on your tiptoes. After this assessment, your doctor will diagnose you and let you know what is wrong.\nIn most cases, surgery is not necessary with minor cases of planter", "8 answers\nHello I'm 19 years old, I've had flat feet my whole life, a few months ago I started having this pain in my heel every time I walk for 5 minutes or so. After a bit or research I found out I had plantarus fasciitis (I might have wrote it incorrectly idk it's hard to spell). I googled about this, went to the Dr. (who is apparently very unskilled, she didn't really help me), and my mother bought me a pair of arch supports. The pain is still there after being on my feet for about 10 minutes but it isn't too bad. If I use the arch support it kind of helps, but I feel like the pain comes back after a while, when I remove it. I don't want to wear the thing all day because it feels awkward, so every now and then I'll just take it out and sit down. By the end of the day my foot feels a lot better though. One thing that makes it a LOT WORSE is when my dog licks my bottom of my right foot it makes the whole underside of it swollen and hurts for a long time. Is there anyway to treat this problem or am I just gonna have to deal with it for the rest of time?\nPlantar fascitis is the inflammation of a the connective tissue at the bottom or your heel, called the plantarfascia. It occurs due to overuse, or inactivity. You should not continue to run on an injury, that is just an invitation for it to get worse. Rest, ice, ibuprofen, over the counter anti inflammatory, arch lifts, splinting, strengthening, stretching. All can be performed, by you, at home. Get plenty of heel raises, in a stretch position, on the front of your foot. Use a firm ball, tennis ball works great, to roll and stretch out the bottoms of feet. Keep the anti infalmatory on board, for no longer than 2 weeks. Also, it may help to soak them in warm water and Epsom salts for stress relief. Check with your Dr, about a prescribed physical therapist or chiro for treatment. Good Luck.\nHello,I am a practicing physical therapists,and have seen hundreds of people who have had \" plantars fascitiis \" before. This is an inflammation,as the word says,of the fascia,( a", "Ask an Expert\nWhat are the current treatments for plantarfascitis?\nQ: I have been diagnosed with plantari fasicitis. What are some of the latest ideas in treating this and what should I be doing to speed my recovery?\nA: Plantar flexor tendinitis is a type of foot pain that occurs at the bottom of your foot due to too much stretching of a tendon in your muscles in the middle part of this plant. It can be a painful and debilitating problem. While there are many treatment options for your pain you should consider, I want to focus on things that you can do that may help you reduce the inflammation and pain from your plantaris tendinopathy.\nFirst of course, it\u2019s important for me to say that a diagnosis of plantarian tendontis should be made by a qualified professional. There are several possible reasons why you might be experiencing this type pain. One of these is related to poor muscular control as well as imbalance between these muscles. Because this is often a problem that affects young adults, they tend to be less likely to consult a health professional about it. But because they are often less informed, this leads to a number of problems and frustrations. I think it is time for us to look at some common solutions to this painful issue.\nThere are actually several different treatment methods available to help people deal with their plantorosis tendopathy. They include manual procedures such as massage, ultrasound and dry needling, as wells as therapies like acupuncture, stretching exercises and even surgery to relieve tension in these ligaments. However, some people find that their condition doesn\u2019t respond well to these methods. If this happens then there is another option called \u2018tendon rehabilitation\u2019.\nTendontitis is part farsiciatosis, which refers to the disorder of tissue surrounding the tendon and joint capsule (a protective structure around a joint). When one is suffering from this disorder, inflammation develops due on either side of his tendon. This results in swelling around the area and a sharp pain around or near the affected tendon.\nIt sounds like yours symptoms may fit with some form of tendon disease. A specialist will be able to make a better judgment regarding the best course of action, but hopefully your issue won\u2019t be too severe.", "| Health\nPlantar fasciitis is a condition most often seen in adults between the ages of 40 and 60. The plantarfascia is one of the key structures in the foot, linking the heel bone to the toe bones. This strong band of connective tissue supports the arch of your foot and helps you push off the ground when you walk, run, or jump. Because plantarsupport is built to withstand a good amount of stress on a daily basis, it can become damaged or develop micro-tears on the surface. If you\u2019re experiencing any heel pain after you get out of bed in a seated position or after long periods of inactivity, you may have developed Plantarfacsicitis. It\u2019s important to address the condition, as prolonged or worsening Plantarfasiciittus not only causes significant pain but can lead to issues with walking and even other foot-related issues like neuroma, which causes numbness and tingling.\nIf you have Plantarsupp, your doctor may recommend a few types of treatment, including painkillers and oral corticosteroid injections. You may also be prescribed shoe inserts or anti-inflammatories. In some cases, surgery may be recommended, although it is often the last option. A doctor will try more conservative treatments first, especially if you just have a mild case of Plantariasis.\nPlantarfacissitis isn\u2019t something to be ignored. There are many different treatment options and your physical therapist can help you with pain management, rehabilitation, strengthening, range of motion, flexibility, balance, manual modalities, therapeutic massage and other types.", "What is a high foot arch?

Is my foot fat?\nWhat I am actually doing here, is giving you this plantars fascia specific exercise to perform as you are going to sleep tonight in bed.\nLie down and grab your foot, put it across your body, holding it like a baseball bat with your elbows flat on the floor.\nNow you start the rotation. I want you to start with the toe down on your left, down to your right and back to down again to left.

I am 50 years old and have had a few episodes of nausea and vomiting. My doctor has ordered an endoscopic exam. Is this the right test to detect liver and lipnodes?\nAn upper endoscope is a test that is used to look at the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It is not used for looking at liver or lip nodes. Lip nodes are lymph nodes that are located in the neck. They are not related to the liver. Liver cancers are usually detected by a CT scan or ultrasound of the abdomen.", "Do you suggest to do an endoscopic ultrasound also?\nThe standard of screening upper endoscopies do not perform a biopsy for a primary liver, so you can do a thorough examination of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum and get the results of how many polyps were found in each of these areas, how big are the polyp in diameter, is there blood in the stool or on the endoscope or in your stool after the examination. I believe EUS endoesocpic ulntrasounds for pancreat, and liver are more expensive for the insurance and we do know that most of polypo are benign or do no grow after biopsy\nYes and no. If you have already had an Upper GI, the doctor can certainly collect tissue from that procedure. In terms of evaluating a liver mass, if there has been new bloodwork and ultrasound, you may be able to forego liver biopsy. It is important to find out what type of biopsy was done. Endoscopic liver biopsies are only feasible for superficial liver tumors. The depth of a tumor is gauged by ultrasound to be sure it will be removed and evaluated by pathologists. An upper gastroenterology consultation may have a very good answer for you. Good luck!\nFirst of all, an EGD is typically not used for looking at the liver. When looking in to the GI tract, we primarily look at what is in or around the stomach. Usually, a CT scan will best evaluate your liver tumor, because it doesn't just need visualization by your doctor's eye, but also analysis of its depth by the pathologist. Sometimes, liver nodules can be caused by primary colon and stomach cancers, which the colonospy will evaluate for. Hope that helps.\nEndoscopic ultrasaound is not part of routine screening for liver disease. There are two types of lesions that can occur in liver: primary and secondary. Most common cancer secondary to liver is lung. Upper Endosocopy as part as the screening tool help in identifying primary tumors such as esophageal cancer, lymphoma, sarcoma. However upper endsocp and biopsy of stomach helps in finding gastric carcinoma, adenomas and precaninous lesion.

{"Question": "Can an abscessed tooth cause a heart attack?", "Free_form_answer": "1. A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).", "Must_have": ["An abscessed tooth can potentially lead to an infection spreading to the heart known as infective endocarditis, if bacteria from the tooth abscess get into the bloodstream and attach to certain areas of the heart.", "This is more common in individuals with damaged or artificial heart valves, congenital heart defects, or implanted heart devices, but can occur in people with normal heart valves as well.", "Poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase the risk for infection."], "Nice_to_have": ["Infective endocarditis is a serious condition that can cause damage to the heart, leading to serious and sometimes fatal complications.", "It can develop quickly, known as acute infective endocarditis, or slowly, known as subacute infective endocarditis.", "Although there is a potential link between an abscessed tooth and heart issues, it's important to understand that most heart attacks are a result of coronary heart disease."], "sample_predictions": ["The answer is yes. An absessed tooth can cause heart problems. The infection from the absess can spread to the heart and cause damage. If the infection is not treated, it can lead to a stroke or even death.\nAn abscesed (or infected) tooth is a serious condition that can have serious consequences if not properly treated. In some cases, an infected tooth may lead directly to heart disease. This is because the bacteria that cause tooth infections can also cause inflammation in the blood vessels, which can then lead back to your heart.\nIf you have an infection in your mouth, you should see a dentist as soon as possible. They will be able to determine whether or not the tooth needs to be removed, and they will also be better equipped to treat any other problems that may be caused by the infected teeth.\nCan An Abscess Tooth Cause A Heart Attack?\nAn infected or absceded teeth can be a sign of a more serious problem. It can indicate that there is an underlying infection that has spread from your teeth to other parts of your body. When this happens, the body\u2019s immune system will try to fight off the invading bacteria by producing antibodies. These antibodies can travel through your bloodstream and attack other organs, including your brain and heart. As a result, people with an untreated absceced tooth are at risk for developing heart attacks or strokes.\nHow Does An Infected Tooth Lead To Heart Disease?\nThe bacteria in an infeceted tooth will travel to different parts in our body, such as the brain, heart, lungs, etc. Once it reaches the bloodstream, these bacteria can enter the circulatory system and travel throughout the entire body.\nThe most common way for bacteria to enter our bloodstream is through our mouth. Bacteria can get into our mouths when we eat or drink something that contains bacteria. For example, if you eat a piece of fruit that was not washed properly, then you could get bacteria on your hands and then transfer it to another part of the fruit. Then, when you bite into the piece, those bacteria will enter your system through the mouth.\nAnother way that bacteria enter into your blood stream is when they are introduced into an open wound. A cut or scrape on the skin can allow bacteria from outside sources to get inside the wound and into circulation. Finally, some people have a condition called \u201coral thrush\u201d which causes white patches on their tongue and throat. Oral thrus is caused when yeast overgrows in certain areas of", "No\nNo. While the heart will sense an infection and may begin to beat more frequently if left untreated, there is no scientific connection between a tooth absess or any other dental disease and heart disease.\nHeart Attack Symptoms to Remember\nThe most serious symptoms are:\nSevere pain in the neck, jaw, upper shoulders, and arms\nThis pain usually occurs on the left or right side of your body. If it spreads, it's a sign that you could be experiencing a serious issue.\nA strange, persistent feeling of anxiety\nIf you feel itchy on top of a fever, seek medical attention. This is a symptom that may be more serious.\nFeeling like you're about to faint\nYou may feel lightheaded or weak even though you can't define the sensation.\nUnusual feelings in your chest or throat\nFeelings like warmth, pressure, or tightness in or around your heart may signal a problem.\nI'm feeling uncharacteristically short of breath\nShortness of breathing that comes on suddenly and doesn't go away may indicate a significant health issue, especially if you have no underlying respiratory diseases.\nIf any of these symptoms don't respond to standard medical treatment, you may require surgery.\nThe sooner you get it examined, the better.\nSeek emergency medical help as soon as possible if any symptoms indicate the danger of having a coronary attack. Some people who are having an attack show no symptoms or just mild heartburn. These people may have a delayed diagnosis as a result. Call 911 or have someone take you to the emergency room.\nAlso read: What Is A Heart Attack And What Can You Do To Prevent It?\nAre there any dental diseases that can cause heart attacks?\nWhile there are many medical reasons that might cause tooth infection, including diabetes, endocarditis, AIDS, cancer, alcoholism, malnutrition, smoking or having sickle cell anemia, only certain systemic diseases with the exception of the aforementioned ones increase heart risks. They include:\nChronic inflammation that damages blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction)\nPeriodontal and gum diseases\nOther dental treatments can have various negative effects, but none of their side effects is cardiac disease-related.\nTooth Infections or Cavities May Make You More Prone to Heart Attacks, But How?\nWhen bacteria colonize a dental cavity and turn it into a cavity, they begin breaking down the enamel of that tooth, which can eventually lead to decay. Inflammation is caused by infection of bacteria and", "There has been some talk lately about a possible link between dental abscesse and heart attacks. But the research that supports this link is very limited and not conclusive. Some experts believe that having an infected, or absessed, tooth could increase the odds of a subsequent heart disease or heart problem. There have been studies that show these links. Other studies have not.\nOne study found that gum disease may cause damage to the lining of the arteries, which makes the tissue in that area more susceptible to infection and more likely to cause additional strain on the heart. Another study from the University of Helsinki found a link that increased levels of inflammatory markers in the blood. This could lead to clotting and cause heart diseases as well. The University researchers also found the same link in patients with a history of gum inflammation.\nThis study only included 200 patients, so it\u2019s hard t make a strong conclusion from it. However, it is an important question that needs to be asked, if an oral absescence in one tooth can cause or increase a higher chance for stroke in another patient. It isn't known for sure if that is the case. That is why people are advised to contact their dentist at the first sign of any dental problems, gum or tooth condition.\nAnother study, published in 2013 in The American Heart Association journal, determined that there is a connection between the inflammation of teeth and oral bacteria with heart conditions like heart valve infection or coronary artery disease. According to researchers, the link can be traced back to high blood pressure, smoking, weight problems and even diabetes. Diabetes is linked to oral diseases like tooth decay, periodontal disease, and tooth loss, all which are factors that can contribute to heart or gum conditions.", "- A heart absccess causes a similar heart palpitation that is caused by other conditions. - If an unerlying condition is causing the abnormal heartbeat, such as a blood clot, the heart will stop. So the answer is yes, although the likelihood of a person having an underlying condition that causes the palpitations without first noticing some of the other obvious symptoms is rare.\nCan teeth cause tooth infections that cause heart attacks?\nDoes smoking cause the tooth extraction process cause for a possible bacterial heart infection?\nYes, because the teeth were infected prior to the surgery, leaving a weakened part of your immune system that can catch any bacteria in the environment.\nWhat can a dentist do to reduce or eliminate the risk of infection in heart patients?\nIn general, avoid treatment that will not give immediate symptomatic relief, as well as treatments that risk increased post-op morbidity. Most patients with an artificial heart valve (either prosthetic valve or repaired valve) may have treatment with the exclusion of dental implant therapy and dental procedures on the distal surface of teeth anterior to a prosthetically treated quadrant.\nHow can I protect my teeth if I\u2019m in an accident?\nProtect Yourself with Mouthguards: If you play a contact sport, you\u2019ll love a mouthguard made of soft plastic. It snaps over the upper teeth with voids for the lower teeth. They can be used in any sport and may reduce the impact of blows to your jaw or face. Because mouthguards can make your mouth stuffy and you more likely to sweat, some people choose mouth forms molded to fit in specific areas of their mouths. These fit only in one jaw, but reduce stuffiness and sweating.\nA toothache is a common condition. Causes may be related to decay, a cyst, or other types of tooth and gum problems.\nTooth pain should always be taken seriously. If the cause of pain is related tooth decay or injury to teeth or gums, then one should seek immediate medical help. However, many tooth pain treatments can improve the comfort and appearance of one's smile. In-office treatments such a dental crown placement, tooth extractions, root canal and periodontal treatment options can help a patient to return to everyday activities with renewed confidence and self-esteem.\nIf a cavity is left untreated, it can cause major complications. The damage caused can progress to affect not only a tooth, its jaw bone or an entire arch of multiple teeth.\nThe longer the cavity goes without treatment, an infection, bone loss and jaw pain symptoms", "How can my heart be saved during heart failure?\nAs always, I'll start this piece by stating that I'm not able to give a definitive answer and I am not a doctor. However, we do know that there can be effects on the heart resulting from poor dental hygiene and that dental health isn't that much of a surprise to be related to better overall health.\nWhile I've covered the effects of tooth loss and gum disease on heart health in the past I wanted to tackle this question. Here's what I found:\nThe connection between tooth and mouth infection and heart attacks or strokes is not completely proven, but they do exist. A recent study showed that people with heart disease who had their plaque and bacteria studied were more likely to have bacteria from their mouth in their hearts than healthier people. Another study has also pointed at possible links between heart problems and poor oral health. They also tested the plaque in arteries from 100 people, 40 dead of heart conditions and 60 of other causes.\nDentists also point to bacteria as being able get in your blood and cause plaque buildup. Studies have also found that bacteria can affect your cholesterol and if plaque builds up in an artery, in a large enough amount, there is a risk of blockage which can cause heart issues such as angina and myocardial infarction. The risk from this seems to increase as we age.\nAnother connection is the fact that gum inflammation causes you to release proteins into the bloodstream which in turn can damage blood vessels. These can then become inflamed and raise your risk for a stroke or heart injury. So if you suffer from heart or vascular issues, as well as tooth decay or gum issues you should probably see your dentist.\nAs far as what your options are for curing gum problems like periodontal disease, or other heart ailments, it's a little easier to say that you can try to avoid or stop smoking, have proper rest, regular activity, and good nutrition and get a medical and dental exam each year to see if there are any issues. You should also try and avoid sugary foods and acidic juices which will promote tooth erosion and cavities.\nYou may also want to try taking an aspirin, which according to medical research, can help prevent certain artery clotting, heart damage and other cardiovascular problems.\nHeart health is such a delicate issue, you really do have to pay attention and take better care of yourself than if suffering from, say, an ankle sprain. To find out more", "How does inflammation affect the heart? Researchers have suggested that if an inflammation is uncontrolled, it can lead to heart problems. If inflammation reaches the cardiac valves, a serious heart disease known as non-bacterial valvulitis can occur. What is non bacterial valvalitis?\nNon-bacteraial valvatulititis is a condition which is caused by an unresolved infection of the body. Inflammation of heart muscles can affect cardiac valve leading to non bactrian valsalbitis.\nCardiac valves have three layers. An inflammation in the internal layer of cardiac muscles causes the swelling of innermost cardiac valvae layer, but the surface of outer layer remains unaffected. As a result, the fluid circulates freely between the outer and inner cardiac muscle layer. This results in a reduction of blood flow. Over time, nonbacterial inflammatory disease called nonbiacterial disease occurs.\nMost of people are unaware that valve problems can also be caused due to bacterial infection. The bacterial infections cause an infection called bacterial infective endocarditis.\nNonbactriaval valvetilus can be detected by a chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan and an ECG. These tests can detect any heart abnormalities.\nDobutamine stress echo: It is similar to treadmill test but in this test the blood supply is injected into the veins to make the person breathe heavily thus helping in finding out any abnormalities during stressful activity.\nTransesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) : It involves a flexible tube containing ultrasound device which are used to see the insides of body as this tube passes through the esophagus to check any abnormality.\nWhat are the risk factors of Nonbacteria valsvilitis?\nIf an acute heart problem is identified, medication should be started immediately. Doctors may prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics to ensure the infection is not severe. A surgery may be required if the patient is critically ill and suffers from severe heart rhythm dysfunction.\nValve repair or valve replacement surgery is recommended for patients who have severe inflammation or who is unable to tolerate the medication. During replacement any of these valves is replaced by one of synthetic artificial valve.\nA heart transplant may also require if heart valves are severely inflammed.\nHow to Treat Non Biacterial Valsalitis?\nPatients with noninfective valveluitis require lifelong monitoring tests.

How is Synapsis (Stroke) diagnosed? What are the treatment options for Synapses (Strokes)? When should a patient be referred to a specialist? How can Synopses (strokes) be prevented?\nSyncope is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and muscle tone. It is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain. Synapes (synapses) are a type of ischemic (lack of blood) stroke. They occur when there is an interruption in the blood supply to part of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of brain tissue. This can happen when a blood vessel becomes blocked or ruptures. The most common cause of synapses is ischemia, which occurs when the arteries that supply blood to parts of your brain become narrowed or blocked. Other causes include bleeding into the space around your spinal cord, a tumor pressing on your spine, or an infection such as meningitis. Symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, weakness, numbness or tingling in one arm or leg, difficulty speaking, and loss or change in vision. Treatment depends on the underlying cause but may include medications, surgery, physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy.\nSynapse is defined as a connection between two neurons. A synapse can be either excitatory or inhibitory. Excitatory synapsises cause the postsynaptic neuron to fire, while inhibiting synopsises prevent the firing of postsympathetic neurons.\nThe pathogenesis of stroke is complex and multifactorial. There are many risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, previous stroke or transient ischemi attack (TIA), and carotid artery disease. In addition, there are several genetic factors that increase the risk of developing stroke.\nDiagnosis of Stroke\nThe diagnosis of a stroke depends upon the clinical presentation and the results of imaging studies. Imaging studies include computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic source imaging, positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning, single photon emission computed (SPECT) tomogram, angiography, electroencephalography EEG, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, carboxyhemoglobin measurement, blood gas analysis, cerebrospinal fluid analysis.\nTreatment Options for Stroke Patients\nThere are two main types of treatment for patients who suffer", "How is it diagnosed?\nFainting or passing out\nTemporary loss of consciousness due to low blood pressure\nNo permanent damage occurs to the brain\nFrequently preceded by nausea, sweating, and feeling chilled\nLoss of blood in the area to be operated\nStoppage in a major artery of the body\nSyncope is an event of sudden transient loss in consciousness, which may or may not involve falling. This brief period of unconsciousness is usually caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to a part of or the entire brain. In contrast to sudden cardiopulmonary arrest, syncope usually occurs in patients who have normal baseline brain function.\nTransient synapse or fainting refers to temporary unexplained loss consciousness. Synapse and seizure can be different but they are often mistakenly confused. During seizure, brain nerves may be abnormally triggered causing involuntary contraction and movement of a muscles of body. With synapses, we lose consciousness for a brief time but brain cells are not disturbed. Other abnormal conditions occur in conjunction with synapsing. Dizziness and faint feeling are experienced by many people but some may also experience nausea and sweating.\nThis condition may occur when too much or too little blood goes to brain and the nervous system. When blood stops properly flowing to your brain, then synapting can occur. But this condition can also occur because of emotional distress or excitement, low oxygen levels or very low concentration of sugar in our blood. Most people suffer synopsing without knowing the exact cause of it. It can last anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds.\nSynapse is more common than not. One out of every three people will likely suffer from transient synapt or synopling when he or she reaches age. Transient synopt is not in general very serious, although there are many different causes of synaping.\nWhat are the causes and risk factors of Synopsinging?\nThere are different risk of factors that cause synapes. Many people feel they have to go to ER because they don\u2019t know what they feel when they faint they may experience symptoms such as:\nFast or abnormal heart rate or rhythm, called arrhythmia \u2013 The heart muscles are too tense or loose to pump normally. They become weak and stiff to do their job. If heart has to work harder to make blood go places all other organs can not get enough blood.\nLightheadedness or near faint is called presynapse. Presynaps can come right before a synaption occurs. Someone may feel presy", "Synapse Definition: A synapse is a structure composed of three fundamental parts. The presynaptic bouton (1) and postsynaptical neuron or muscle end plate (2) are joined by a cleft (3) (or synaptic space). The cove is filled with a solution rich in electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium, chlorine. What Does Synapsis Mean on a Biology Exam?. What is the meaning of synapsing in biology? A neuron can have as many as 10,000 synapses. As a result, neurons can combine input from many sources. When a neuron releases neurotransmitters into synaptic coves, it is referred to as synaptic activity. A neurotransmitter, sometimes found in cells, is released by one nerve cell into a synaptic gap (synapse). What does Synapses mean in a neural network? We will look at two examples of how neurons communicate in their next posts: Electrical and Chemical communication. Synaptogenesis and Synaptic Plasticity (Synaps). They can be used by the neurons for electrical signals after the development of a synaptoneuron relationship. Chemical signaling, on the other hand, has more flexibility. Neurons can build connections with other neurons by exchanging neurochemicals across the synaptic cleave, which is an electrical signal. To maintain a connection, the brain needs to have a physical connection. Neurotransmitters are released when synpaps are activated, and neurotransmissions are carried across gaps. We\u2019ll learn more about synpsy in detail in upcoming posts. If you\u2019re wondering what this means, don\u2019t be alarmed. How many are in one synapose Synps?. This is due in part to the number of neurons there are and how many of these nerve cells are connected to other nerve fiber tissues (neurons). It\u2019s also because there\u2019s a huge variation in connection numbers among different people. It can also vary depending on whether we are talking about the synaptic density in the human brain or the density of the animal brain (for example, in rats).

If the oxygen supply is cut off completely, then permanent damage is made to the part of brain, which will never recover. This means that you will definitely die.\nThis happens during ischemic attack as the blood supply in brain is abruptly interrupted.\nYour lungs are not working when you are unconscious, so you do not breathe and this leads to decrease amount in O2 in the body.

It is not a vitamin or mineral, but it is important for the proper functioning of the enzymes in our bodies. Coenzymes are not use by Muslims because they are made from animal products. The benefits of coenzyme are that it helps to break down food and absorb nutrients, and it also helps with energy production.\nCoenzymatic is an enzyme that helps other enzymes work. They are found in all living things, including humans. There are many different types of enzymes, each with its own function.\nWhat is Co-enzyme?\nA co-enzyme is any substance, other than an amino acid, that can be used to catalyze a chemical reaction. In other words, a coenzime is something that makes a reaction happen faster or more efficiently. For example, the enzyme catalase can break hydrogen peroxide down into water and oxygen. However, if you add a small amount of manganese dioxide to the reaction, it will speed up the process even more. This is because manganese oxide is also a catalyst for this reaction.\nThe word \u201ccoenzyme\u201d comes from the Greek words \u201ckoinos\u201d meaning \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cenzume\u201d which means \u201cenzyme.\u201d So, coenyzmes are substances that are used by enzymes to make them work better.\nThere are two main types: co-factors and co-substrates. A cofactor is usually a metal ion like magnesium or zinc. These ions help the active site of an enzymes bind to its substrate (the molecule it breaks down). A co substrate is another molecule that the substrate needs in order to be broken down by theenzyme. An example of this would be ATP which provides energy for many reactions in cells.\nHow does Coenyme work?\nThe co enzyme is the part of a protein that binds to another protein and helps it function properly. Enzymes are proteins that catalyzes chemical reactions. Without enzymes, many important reactions would not occur in living organisms. Some enzymes are very specific, while others can work on a variety of different substrates.\nEnzyme activity is regulated by a number of factors, such as temperature, pH, substrate concentration, cofactors, inhibitors, activators, allosteric effectors, etc. Cofactors are small molecules that help anenzyme function more effectively. Examples of cofactos include metal ions (e.g", "- Daily News Egypt\nHealth Health What are Co-Enzymes? and are they Halal, usefull, and safe for our body?\nWhat do Coenzymes do?\nA coenzyme is a molecule that binds to a protein and aids in the catalysis of its chemical reactions. Covalently or non-covalent interactions bind proteins and cofactors. The enzymes that have the cofactor protein are known as cofactored enzymes. Enzymatic action in response to molecular interactions between proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, complex carbohydrates, or inorganic cofactions is accelerated by coenzymatic interactions. Proteins can be found in nature as vitamins B2, B3, biotin, folate, ubiquinone, co-enzyme A, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and many others. To maintain cellular efficiency and health, it is essential to have all nutrients in adequate quantities in our bodies. Nutrients and supplements enhance metabolism and function. These include Co-Q-10 and other co-exist enzymes.\nWhat does Aminco (Coenzyme) do, exactly, in its active form?\nThe active components in CoA and the CoQ (Ubiquinol), are natural molecules that are found within all living cells, which help keep them functioning optimally. They are an essential element of the inner mitochondria processes that generate the cell\u2019s energy, a.k.a. EATB. It also helps the body in protecting our heart muscle cells and blood vessels and provides support to our neurological and immunological functions.\nCoQ10, one of a range of these chemicals, is known to support cardiovascular health by helping to reduce oxidative stress in cells.\nWho is Co-AminCo manufactured for?\nThis product is manufactured to provide support for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases, cancer, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nIngredients of what are co enzymes:\nIngredients in every capsule: A 100mg supplement of AminoCo (coenzyme Q- 10 active and natural), contains 75mg of coq10 (natural active) + 15 mg of ubiquiole (pure co 0,10) & 60mg vitamin B complex, 20 mg folic acid\nHow do I take the supplement?\n2 tablets daily, should be swallowed with warm liquids, preferably with your breakfasts\nAs the world\u2019s best Co", "| Dr. Fazal Rahim | Health Care Tips in Urdu\nWhat is a CoEnzyme and it is usefull for us or not?

Its name is of Greek origin. The prefix \u201cen\u201d indicates inclusion, adding to, whereas the Greek \u201czym\u201d or its Arabic equivalent \u201csalamia\u201d refers an activity.\u00a0\nThe question pertains to how an object becomes an \u201cenzyme\u201d; its definition is that it is a \u201cnatural biological catalyst, that helps speed up biochemical reactions\u201d. An enzyme is defined as any compound that can speed-up chemical reactions in body. They are classified into six groups: Hydrolase enzymes, Transferase, Lyases, Ligases or synthetase; Isomerases and Reductases. Enzymes cannot function in isolation, they can do so only when they are in the presence of what we call \u201ccoenzymes\u201d. That is, in most cases enzymes use energy-rich molecules known as coenzmes.\u00a0\nCozymers are considered as necessary vitamins in that absence of them causes diseases of metabolism or defects of organ function. Their synthesis is not possible in human body and they must be a component of the foods we eat. This would include the vitamins of B complex particularly, those of group B such as: Inositol, Nicotinic acid, Pantothenic acid and Folic acid. However, enzymes and cozymemes should not be considered a part of human nutrition, their synthesis and function is by enzymes of organisms.\nEnzymatic activity is considered in its function as a protein that exists in any substance or living materials that catalyze or enable a chemical reaction, its absence causes illness. It can be understood as part metabolic pathways, however, without their presence these pathways could take place. A typical example of this case is liver function, it can produce glycogen from galactose. Even though the process of reaction is known, there are cases of glycogensia in which galates is transferred towards other forms of sugar, such that that of glycoprotein, glycocolipide or glycosaminoglycan, causing abnormal conditions of mucin.\nThus, as an inquirer inquired in regard to the effect of enzyme production and its activity and effect on the creation of another enzyme, especially in relationship to human reproduction, the answer that I can give is: What is generated is an effect that takes place in different ways and through the interaction of", "Can Al-ma`dah (Dihydromedinine) is also called co-enzyme A?\nThe components (Co-A) of the coenzyme vitamin B5 is formed from a number of elements including the carbon atom. As you know; the use of carbon is not allowed in Islam.\nThus, we can conclude that Co-A does not represent any ingredient to make use out of; and therefor no one can benefit in general.", "What if someone takes supplements which have it?\nI believe \u201ccoenzyme\u201d (vitamin B coenzyme) is not a specific name but rather a generic name encompassing all vitamins and coenzymes. They can be ingested safely. However, do not overdose and try to take an amount of more than half of your recommended daily allowance. Many Muslims take vitamin B complex that contains co enzyme. It is beneficial. Take it at the end of the day.\nI don't understand what you have mentioned in red.\nThe meaning of\u00a0\u2018co enzyme\u2019: an enzyme that interacts only with a single enzyme, thereby increasing the enzyme\u2019s ability to catalyze a chemical reaction. Vitamins and minerals help to manufacture co enzymes that the body needs to function efficiently. The term co-enzymed is used in biology for substances that serve to make another enzyme work better.\u00a0\nCo enzymes are vital to every reaction in your body and they help us convert the food we eat to the energy we use to power our lives. That being said, an overdose co\u00a0enzyme can cause unwanted effects. There have been reports of some vitamins or minerals causing nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and heart palpitations.\nDo not take a supplement that\u2019s containing more of co enamel than the recommended intake.\nIn Islam, it is permissible for us Muslims to eat food, use health supplements, medicine and drink in times of need; there is general consensus on this from the scholars of our Ummah (Muslim community) from all schools of thought.

The most effective way to detect most autoimmune disorders is through lab testing (such as blood tests, urine tests and imaging tests) in combination with your medical report. If your doctor suspects that you have an autoimmune disease, they will first perform lab tests to check for various kinds of antibodies (proteins that are released by the body's immune cells). If you're diagnosed with an auto-immune disease by rheumatologists, you will most likely need medication to control the associated symptoms.\nIf the cause continues even after treatment, it means that the symptoms are due to a problem with the way your autoimmune system works. Once your physician has ruled out other causes for your symptoms, he or she may refer you to someone who specializesin the treatment of autoimmune conditions.\u00a0\nWhat Are The Common Immune Disorders\nAn autoimmune disorder is a condition in which the\u00a0immune system attacks the cells of your own body by mistake.

When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day.

The answer is 30 years. In 1982, a study was published in the Journal of Urology that showed that men who took NSAIDS were more likely to have erectile difficulties. The study showed a 50% increase in impotence in men taking NSAISD. This study has been replicated many times since then. It is now well established that Non-Aspirins NSAIsD can lead to erectile issues.\nWhat is the mechanism of action of NSAids? NSAid\u2019s work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin is a hormone that is responsible for the dilation of blood vessels. When prostoglanding is inhibited, the blood flow to the penis is reduced. As a result, men may experience erectile difficulty.\nHow do NSAisD cause impotency? There are several ways that this can happen. First, NSAiD\u2019s can reduce the amount of testosterone in a man\u2019s body. Testosterone is necessary for a healthy sex drive. Second, they can increase the levels of prolactin in your body, which can also lead a decrease in sex desire. Third, Non-Apirn NSAId\u2019s may cause a condition called Peyronie\u2019s disease. Peyrone\u2019s is an abnormal curvature of the erect penis. Finally, some NSA\u2019s have been shown to cause an increase of a protein called PDE5. PDES is what causes the erection to occur. If PDS is increased, it can make it more difficult to get an erection.\nAre there any other side effects of Non Aspiran NSAIds? Yes, there are. NSA\u2019is can be hard on the stomach. They can irritate the lining of your stomach and cause ulcers. Also, if you are taking a blood thinner, you should not take NSAI\u2019s. Blood thinners can interact with NSA\u2019S and increase your risk of bleeding.\nIf you have any questions about NSA\u2019d\u2019s and erectile function, please contact your doctor. He or she can help you decide if NSA\u2019i\u2019s are right for you.", "What are the implications of this association?\nErectile issues are not a pleasant topic of conversation for many men. It seems that as a society we prefer to brush sexual difficulties under the rug, like it doesn\u2019t exist. However, that could be changing, because a recent study has linked erectile problems to the use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for more than two weeks.\nErections and erectile health are vital for the satisfaction of men\u2019s sex lives. Erectile issues have also been linked to increased risks of premature death from cardiovascular disease. With more knowledge about erectile issues comes better methods in prevention and treatment. Studies have shown positive impacts on erectile and cardiovascular health caused by certain diets, a decrease in alcohol and caffeine consumption, and quitting/limiting smoking. Recent studies also provide new evidence of increased erectile risk due to NSAIDS.\nNSAIDs are a broad medication that includes aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). They are used to treat pain, fever, menstrual cramps and inflammatory conditions. They work to reduce pain by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 which causes inflammation. COX-1 is another enzyme that is also present in the arteries and produces prostaglandin. Prostaglandins act like messengers to carry signals through the body. Increased levels of prostlanding are associated with blood thickening and cause blood vessels to constrict, especially in arteries. NSAODS interfere with the production of both COx-2 and CO-3, which can also thin the blood and affect sexual health.\nWhile some studies have been inconclusive and other have only examined short-term effects of using the medications, this current study suggests that long-term NSAISD use may be linked with erectile dysfunctions. The study had participants with a mean age of 62 years, an average of approximately 25 years of treatment with NSAOIDS, 55% were men, with 59% receiving treatment for osteoarthritis and 11% for rheumatoid arthritis. Some symptoms of erectile difficulties that these men experienced included reduced libido, soft erections, or the inability to obtain an erection. Men in this study were between 40-80 years with an overall usage of non-asprin nSAIDS for 4-37 years. In that time frame, it is no doubt that their sexual appetite has changed along with their", "And why did it take this long for the FDA to issue this warning?\nWhat are the risks involved taking two NSAIDs, one that is ibuprofen-based, and one with the combination of the two?\nIs it possible to develop a tolerance to the antiinflammatory?\nIn my search for a cure for CFS, I'm trying the ketogenic diet for two months now, so no carbs at all. Only fat and protein, with a little MCT oil. I've taken the Migranal four times, once a day, no problems what so ever! I can't believe that a high fat diet can cure migraines! How does that work?!\nAfter my 2 doses of Miltown, the pain was gone within 1 hour, at worst, for hours to days. That said, in the 12 years I was on these meds, we did some experimenting, which led me to find out 3 interesting things: 4) I took a double dose of 15mg Mltown when a severe migraine hit, 5) it was a slow motion onset of relief for 8 hours. 6) The headache was back again. Later we tried 7) with Tramadol, but that caused insomnia. This was during an attack, there were no side effects. It was interesting. No drug is a perfect solution, though they are better than aspirin. For me, when I had migranes, aspirins would never stop them and they lasted for days.\nI use anti-inflammatories for neck pain and headaches.

But the link was surprising.\nThere's also this from Wikipedia on NSAIDs and male fertility, but I couldn't tell from that if the effects are short-term, long-term or both. The study itself sounds like it was looking into that specific area.\nIn case you're looking for non-asprin, non-Naproxen NSAIs, there are ibuprofen in OTC strength, plus celecoxib, naproxin and (unfortunately also aspirin) in prescription strength. Of those only celeo can be considered non-acid NSAI and should not cause the usual stomach irritation.\nThe ED side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nA man\u2019s sexual performance can have a marked impact on his quality of life. When a man is unable to maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse, this can not only lead to disappointment and frustration but also in the long term, low self-esteem, lack of confidence and relationship problems.\nSo it can come as a real blow when a drug prescribed for a serious medical condition has side effects which can negatively impact upon your sexual health. It is thought that 30% of all men suffer with erection problems at some point in their lives and a common cause is drugs which suppress the level of sex hormones in your body. Fortunately, many of the drugs thought to cause this (with the notable exception of anti-HIV drugs) can still be prescribed if erectile function is monitored and the prescription adjusted as necessary.\nAnother side-effect which has been noted in several drugs is inflammation of your penis as result of suppressed levels of hormones. If you notice pain or swelling of a new onset after starting a course of medication, mention this to your doctor.

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression.

It can also be a result of aging. Aortic valvular stenos is is most common in people over 60 years of age.\nIf you have a stent in your heart, you may be at risk for a heart attack. If you are at high risk, your doctor may recommend that you take a daily aspirin to help prevent a clot from forming in the stented area.\nYou may also need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots from developing in other parts of y our body, such as your legs or brain.\nWhat are the symptoms of aor tic st enosis?\nSymptoms of ao r tic val vular s tenosis include:\n\u2022 Shortness of breath, especially when you exert yourself\n\u2022 Chest pain or pressure, which may feel like a heaviness in you chest\nIf your symptoms are severe, they may include fainting, dizziness, weakness, confusion, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, blurred vision, numbness or tingling in one or both arms or legs, difficulty speaking, loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, death.\nHow is ao rtic st e nosis diagnosed?\nYour doctor will ask you about your medical history and perform a physical examination.

It can get to a point where a surgery has to be done to unblock it, or replace it so the blood can flow freely again.\nWhat are the risks and benefits of surgery for people with small ventricular septal defects? Will they have heart problems later in life?\nTo answer your question, our approach to treatment of ventricualr septa defects is similar to what you described: if there is low blood-flow across the defect and/or there are symptoms from a murmour or heart enlargement, we may perform a surgical repair. We also check the pulmonary pressures to make sure they are not too high.\nI'm afraid there's no way to tell the future but we have found that when large VSDs get repair, there remains a small, but real risk of having more heart disease later.\nMy dad has a ventricle septum defect.

These problems usually result from an increased heart rate and a larger blood output requirement from your heart. This leads to a higher cardiac output, which the diseased aortas can't accommodate very well. Your heart works harder at a greater volume per beat, leading to more strain and fatigue.\nIn these cases, we always start off with lifestyle modifications of medications or supplements, but often have to resort to intervention after a while. The most important thing is to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise along with any other medical instructions given by your physician.\nWe usually start treatment of mild to moderate atheroscleroses with exercise prescription of low-impact activities such as walking, bicycling, swimming, treadmill training, yoga, pilates or golf. Exercise usually improves symptoms in moderate to severe aotrtcclerosis and improves life quality. An aerobic training program along the lines suggested below should be combined with at least one muscular training/ strengthening program. Some examples of these include stretching exercises, strength training with light weights or resistance bands, free weights (e.g., dumbbells), calisthenic exercises (i.e., pushups, situps), and swimming or other non-competitive sports. In severe cases or whenever medical conditions such has lung or heart diseases are present, the intensity may need to be modified to avoid complications.\nThe most current recommendations for exercising with AS are given in terms of maximal heart rates (HR max). These are heart levels you should keep less than when exercising. For most people, this is 80% to 85% of your own maximal HR. You'll want to find this by using your age and subtracting it from 220, or by measuring it when doing a stress test with a monitor. If you do a maximum stress tests, don't try to do another maximum test for at 20-24 hours as this may predispose you to complications. As with all exercise, you will need physician sign off on this before beginning and continue to monitor yourself during activity with an app and check periodically for increased fluid around the lungs.\nFor example, if your HR max is calculated as 150", "I am 70 years of age and in reasonably good health, apart from this possible problem.\nIn my experience patients who get referred to a cardiology clinic often already know something about the condition that they think they have. But in your case I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t agree that you know very much at all. Let me explain.\nYour doctor has told you of a possible narrowing in one of the major arteries of your heart. He has chosen the term \u201caortic\u201d because in the left coronary circulation (which feeds the main pumping chamber of that organ), there are two main blood vessels \u2014 the right coronary artery, which runs across the front of this chamber, while the \u201cleft\u201d artery (a misnomer), which gives off the smaller anterior descending branch, runs on its left margin.\nIt is the latter, as you see, that takes most of its blood from the aorta.\nThe aorto-coronary sinus is about 2 or 3 centimetres long and, under normal circumstances, this space is rather wide. It narrows as it nears the base of heart muscle (the myocardium), of course and gradually becomes less and less in diameter. By the time it reaches what is called the cusps, the three flaps or valves that make up the opening into the chamber to which it leads, a normal narrowing of about a 25 per cent will cause the heart to pump blood more slowly than normal.\nTo a degree, such a narrowing will not be apparent in young people, since it is rare for someone in their twenties to present at a doctor\u2019s office complaining of palpitations, breathlessness with exertion or simply of feeling tired and lethargic. They would probably not know what to attribute that to.\nBut over time the problem accumulates and when it becomes large enough, it will become obvious as the individual approaches his sixties.\nBy this time, all too many of those who have a problem have been smoking too much, drinking too little water, taking too few vitamins (particularly B6, B9, C and E), getting too anxious and too stressed, sleeping too deeply and eating too well.\nThis narrowing could be due to inflammation of one or more of his arteries (atherosclerosis) or damage that has been caused by calcification in them, or by damage to the inner lining of these vessels due, for example, to elevated levels of bad cholesterol.\nThat is why I want", "Stenotic aorta is common in dogs, but the severity of this congenital defect can vary greatly. The narrower you steno, the greater the effect. You may not even realize your dog has a problem until severe symptoms appear. Fortunately, when caught and treated early, most dogs respond well to treatment. It may look like a hole in that valve, or it may actually take the shape of its stent. Both can lead to a narrowing that interferes with the flow of blood through the valve and the atherosclerotic. While your doctor probably knows which version of the stego is in your case, these images can give an idea of what is happening and provide guidance on what to do. Although the causes of different kinds of stents can be different, both forms of a stented aether are called a \u201ccleft\u201d or \u201cstenotic\u201d. Stenting of large ateres usually occurs when the dog\u2019s blood pressure is very high. Aortic aneurysm may also occur in people with coarctation of their aoa. This condition causes a portion of an artery to become clogged, resulting in blood vessel blockage. Treatment of coacrotation may involve angioplasty, which is the removal of plaque from the arteries of your lungs. This is only performed if there are signs of abnormal blood flow. Other dogs may develop a cleft in the aoather. These may appear as a thin or thick area of \u200b\u200bthe ather, where it touches the heart. When this happens, there\u2019s a decrease in pressure inside the vessel \u2013 called an \u201caortic regurgitaton\u201d. While small, isolated aoric stenti are not considered to cause severe symptomatic reguoritation in many dogs and dogs. Even very small holes rarely cause reguriatation. In contrast, aortac regurations may occur when there is an opening at the site where a vein leaves the body, particularly in elderly dogs with heart failure or a stroke. However, some dogs experience sudden death after exercise or stressful situations. Some dogs don\u2019t develop symptoms until they are older. Older dogs are also more likely to have problems with these stenos than younger animals.\nCauses of Sino aor stant\nWe are often asked about the use of beta-blockers as an alternative treatment for this disease. Beta blocker use can cause side effects such as lethargy and constipation. Therefore,", "It's caused by an extra leaflet or layer within the aorta that results in a valve condition that causes the heart to work harder. This results from plaque build-up on the arterial wall that leads to the narrowing of the valve.\nThese can usually be treated by having either a catheter or a surgery procedure done to remove or scrape the extra layer. Otherwise, some medications will help keep it from getting worse.\nA stent helps to prop open the artery and keep the blood flowing. There is nothing I can do with regard to it. However, it is necessary for me to watch my blood pressure and stay active.\nThere is also nothing specific I have to do regarding my atherosclerosis. A healthy diet and exercising is going to help. The atheroma is just going on to form plaque. When this becomes the size of a small marble, I must have this removed. We cannot predict the exact date this will happen.\nDr. Aronin, this one you said my heart muscle was enlarged, but Dr. Zaleski said it wasn't. Who is correct?\nThe left side of your heart looks fine to Drs. Lee and Arnie. Dr Z, my cardiologist, saw it was somewhat enlarged. Since that was eight months ago, he wanted me on daily medication so I could see how I did. He was right.\nThis was just another one of his \u201cwild guesses.\u201d He did ask me, though, if there were any family members like myself. I told him no one has had congestive heart failure to my knowledge.\nHe didn\u2019t like that, so he wrote to all my cousins to see if they had heart problems. To show you how important it isn\u2019t to have a \u201cfamily doctor,\u201d it took them several weeks to respond.

Glucose is an important energy source for the body, and it is produced by the liver and stored as glycogen in muscles and the brain.? When glucose levels are high, insulin is released from the pancreas to help the cells use glucose for energy.? Insulin also helps the kidneys remove excess glucose from blood.? In type II diabetes, cells do not respond to insulin, so glucose builds up in blood and urine, causing symptoms such as thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, weakness, confusion, irritability, depression, anxiety, restlessness, tremors, seizures, coma, or death.? Treatment with Glpizid helps lower blood glucose by increasing the amount of insulin released by pancreases and by decreasing the production of glucose in liver.? This drug is available in tablet form and is taken by mouth once or twice daily.? Dosage is based on age, body weight, medical condition, response to treatment, other medications, diet, exercise, blood sugar levels, kidney function, liver function and other factors.? Side effects may include nausea and vomiting; diarrhea; abdominal cramps; headache; drowsiness; weakness; fatigue; blurred or double vision; dry mouth; constipation; increased appetite; weight gain; skin rash; itching; hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs, arms, neck, back, chest, abdomen, groin, buttocks, thighs, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, toes, ears, nose, mouth, eyes, eyelids,", "I am working at my pharmacy on my rotation currently and need this information. Glipizide and Glucotrol XL were also compared to placebo, although the number of patients in the placebo group was relatively small. There exists a potential for clinically important drug-drug interactions, especially during the initial titration period [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ].. Glucose Control Improvement in glycemic control and a reduction in hypoglycemia were demonstrated during periods of stable glimepridemicrosphere tablets 1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg and metformin tablet dosing as monotherapy for patients with T2DM. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, dose and dose-response study in patients on metfomin montherapy, patients were randomized to dose or dose of treatment (once-daily glimgiperide 8 mg with metforin 2000-2550 mg [dose] vs. glimpepride at 50 or mg (doses) vs placebo).. All these studies showed statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG concentrations in treated patients compared with patients randomized as placebo. The mean reduction from baseline in baseline- to endpoint HBA1C concentrations was greater in metflormin-treated patients than in placebo-treated diabetic patients [27]. The number needed to treat (95% confidence interval [CI]) from the primary efficacy data for hypoglucoseaemia in glycometer-treated type patients was.9 (1.5). A reduction of 10% or more from a prior metorin-montherapy HPLC was shown with glmpide treatment in all diabetic trials studied. A metofmmonotherapy reduction was not seen in some patients, but the reduction might not have been as great during glumipridemonotherapy.

In this essay, it is required to analyze expired product information so that the pharmacy stockroom and the storage conditions as well as the temperature and temperature conditions are described and defined.?\n3. Define the effects and concerns when storage errors are not met by the standard of the Gluvevin manufacturing company? 3\nGluevin is an anti-diabetic agent, produced in pill form by GlaxoSmithKline. Gluevein consists of Glucose 500 mg in 100 ml of distilled water, plus 250 mcg of propene glycerols and other preservative solutions. It has a long half-life and must be stored at temperatures greater than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. To avoid microbial colonization, this medication must, for 10 minutes, be refrigerated and placed in a refrigerator. The drug's efficacy is limited by refrigeration, as it can lead to bacterial contamination by storing it in this environment. A prescriber is allowed to store Glavein up to 6 weeks on the shelf, where he can store it at or above 60 degrees Celsius. For Gluuexin to be stable in its formulation, a temperature of about 32 degrees is suggested. In addition, Gluxes must not be exposed to direct sources of sunlight or oxygen. Therefore, proper storage of this drug requires proper management and planning of temperature, exposure, sunlight and storage. Because of its effect on diabetic patients, medical professionals need to adhere to storage guidelines to protect patients from negative effects of improper storage and distribution. This article will discuss Glvevens and Expiry Time. 5\n?Gluveven is the brand name for metronidazole, sold under its brand names Glumax and Miconazole. There are two forms of gluovin.
