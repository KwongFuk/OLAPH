When injected by an auto injector, GlucaGen delivers 5 mg / mL of glucagon (1 mg per 0.2 mL), which is specific to the GlucaGen Auto injector and recommended for glucagon auto-injector pre-filled syringes.  However, needle and syringe administration allows for end-user administration of the entire contents of the 1 mg vial.\n\nFor needle and syringe administration, the number of milligrams of active ingredient delivered by the entire vial content is the same dose amount whether injected at once or delivered via multiple injections using a series of several vials. Glucagon dose amount comparison: 1 mg vial = one or more 0.2 mL injections.  In emergency situations, when a caregiver would require use of multiple 1 mg vials to inject a patient with glucagon, the injection administration can be titrated to meet the patient\u2019s needs.\n\nIs private prescription for GlucaGen covered by Medicare Part D?\n\nThe vast majority of GlucaGen prescriptions are written by a provider and don\u2019t meet the coverage criteria for the Part D benefit which supports the use of GlucaGen to treat severe hypoglycemia in diabetes patients not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid.

The FDA cited the \u201cstrong association between the use of oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and serious blood clots\u201d when they ordered changes added to warning labels for birth control pills in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the study results, \u201cfour women per 10,000 users of contraceptives containing drospirenone had a serious blood clot, compared to one to two women per every 10,000 users of contraceptives that contain other progestins.\u201d Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are two serious medical conditions that can result from blood clots. DVT occur when a blood clot forms in a vein deep in the body, usually in the legs. PE are caused when a blood clot that breaks off and travels through the venous system, lodging in an artery in the lung where it blocks blood flow to the lungs. The most common symptom of DVT is swelling in one leg (at times both) which is not accompanied by pain, but can actually feel quite tender. PE can cause cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid breathing. These symptoms can also be caused by other less-serious conditions, such as infections and allergic reactions.

Nonetheless, comprehensive investigations and repeated check-ups are necessary, if not life-saving. In the initial part of this piece, we would discuss symptoms and diagnostic approaches relating to temporal arteritis while in the part that follows, the treatment of temporal arteritis in patients is discussed.\n\n## The symptoms\n\nTemporal or giant cell arteritis is the gradual narrowing as well as inflammation[1] of the arteries; at times, this can lead to partial or complete obstruction. Various regions of the body may feel the effect of this illness; although, pain in the temple, jaw joints and upper facial region are symptoms illustrated in the great majority of cases. There is an elevated chance of partial vision loss and complete loss of vision if temporal arteritis is left unidentified and also not treated. Other symptoms include:-\n\n- Persistent Pain in the upper facial tissues and in the upper jaw joint\n- Head pain on both sides around the head\n- The pain is often extremely severe\n- Anorexia, fatigue, rashes, malaises and weight loss\n- Tenderness as well as a stiff neck\n- Tenderness of the scalp\n- Reduced blood supply to various organs in the body\n\nPlatelet count should also be tested for; this is due to the fact that many GCA affected individuals also experience too numerous platelets in their blood.\n\n### The Diagnostic Process\n\nDespite the fact that there is no globally recognized symptom that can be used to diagnose temporal arteritis, the occurrence of headache and upper facial pain in senior citizens along with other possible symptoms, observed in conjunction with the presence of typical laboratory tests like an increase in the concentration of acute-phase reactants and elevated ESRs are good indicators that temporal arteritis may exist.

We compared the looks and the appearance of the product multi-dose ampoules and the concentration of the mono-dose ampoules. Breathing patterns and peak sevoflurane concentrations were investigated inhalational patterns in adults and children. Pharmacokinetics of plasma samples were obtained guaranteeing an accurate picture of sevoflurane. Sevoflurane was breathed by 135 volunteers at 3.0% for 5 min. Biopsies of healthy individuals of the central nervous system, lungs, kidneys, stomach, blood were obtained and examined carefully in microscopic examination.\n\nRESULTS: An overall effectiveness and safety indication can be given after inhalation for a long period of 1 year. There are no significant changes in subjective symptoms that influence sevoflurane or in quality of life. The application of sevoflurane in the concentration of 3% for a full year was also safe for the human body. The only harmful effect of the drug on the central nervous system has been detected in patients with drug interactions that could qualify for changes in mood or in conducting patterns of the central nervous system steroids, such as hallucinations, and behavioural changes upon dosing. There were no variations in the levels of neurotransmitter concentrations or other plasma proteins under consideration.\n\nCONCLUSION: Sevoflurane is a highly stable anesthetic agent. Levels of efficacy and toxicity, which make inhalational anesthesia very safe, prevent numerous harmful effects on the lungs, kidneys and liver steroids, including neurotoxicity.\n\n### Association between plasma levels of total testosterone, free testosterone and insulin-like growth factor -1: a potential endocrine marker of masculinization during male puberty\n\n: The current study was designed to support and expand the understanding of the associations between plasma total testosterone, free testosterone, serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), injection-induced 17beta\u2013estradiol production, and insulin-"}

{"text": "Question: I have a toddler, 22 months, who may have back problems. What kind of doctor should I see.? \n ### Answer: Back pain in children is not common, but it does occur. The most common cause of back pain in children is a strain or sprain of the muscles or ligaments in the back. This can be caused by overuse, such as carrying a heavy backpack, or by a sudden injury, such as falling or being hit.\n\nOther causes of back pain in children include:\n\n- Scoliosis: This is a condition in which the spine curves to the side. It is usually not painful, but it can cause back pain in some children.\n- Kyphosis: This is a condition in which the spine curves forward. It is usually not painful, but it can cause back pain in some children.\n- Scheuermann\u2019s disease: This is a condition in which the spine curves forward. It is usually not painful, but it can cause back pain in some children.\n- Spondylolisthesis: This is a condition in which one vertebra slips forward over the vertebra below it. It is usually not painful, but it can cause back pain in some children.\n- Osteoid osteoma: This is a benign tumor that can cause back pain.\n- Osteomyelitis: This is an infection of the bone. It can cause back pain.\n- Tumors: Tumors can cause back pain.\n\nIf your child has back pain, you should see a doctor. The doctor will ask about your child\u2019s symptoms and will do a physical exam. The doctor may also order tests, such as X-rays, to help diagnose the cause of the back pain.\n\nTreatment for back pain in children depends on the cause of the pain. Treatment may include rest, ice, heat, physical therapy, and pain medication. Surgery may be necessary in some cases.\n\n## What are the symptoms of back problems in toddlers?\n\nBack problems in toddlers can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor posture, carrying heavy objects, and playing on hard surfaces. Symptoms of back problems in toddlers can include pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving.

{"text": "Question: Show the comparable effects of the beta-blocker, Carvedilol, and the blood pressure regulatory drug, Hydralazine, and define if there is any contraindication for these drugs being combined.? \n ### Answer: For full details, see the background information section.Our hypothesis examines whether the appropriate combination of Carvedilol and Hydralazine has substantial synergistic properties, $meaning that when the two drugs are combined the effects of the two drugs are preferably increasing until a heart attack or stroke cannot occur, and when tolerance is achieved,Hydralazine increases vasodilation, therefore speeding up heart attacks.and Carvedilol decreases the congestion of the heart\n\nThis phase II trial examined the added value of combining Carvedilol (\u201cAcebutolol\u201d or \u201cAce-ST\u201d) with traditional Hydralazine (Hydralazine Hydrochloride dihidro-s\u00f3dico paste or Solubilizes paste Hidralasemin). A number of simultaneous reads of systolic blood pressure (BP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were used as measures of vascular function and circulatory stress (VFSS), and systolic blood pressure and MAP as ancillary measures of cardiovascular function (CVDF) Carvedilol is a beta-blocker, and Hydralazine is an ACE inhibitor. Both have a similar long history of usage and outcomes. Carvedilol is used in more than 90 percent ofcauses, and Hydralazine is used in almost 80 percent ofthe ST-elevated myocardial infarction patients, and more recent reports have treated more than 10 percent ofstrokes in African Americans; thus,the outcome rate is moderate in comparison to Carvedilol and Hydralazine together.\n\nTable1. The outcomes demonstrated in the main analysis are 1-year risk rates in comparison to all-cause mortality for each treatment arm, and they do not sufficiently demonstrate the relationship of the intervention to the result of the outcome.Control data for both tertiary and primary efficacy had a baseline proportion of Carvedilol and Hydralazine use of 88.5 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively.An average 1 year of Carvedilol and Hydralazine use was associated with a 3.4 percent mortality rate in both arms at 1 year.Hydralazine useThe corresponding hazards ratios for all-cause mortality (Hydralazinem is not on this list"}

{"text": "Question: Is dementia inherited? Can one develop dementia without inheriting it?\n? \n ### Answer: The latest consensus in the field of dementia is that the vast majority of dementia risk comes from influences we experience during our lifetime, and not from genetics.\n\nFor a very small portion of people (about 4%), dementia is passed on from parent to child. This scenario can happen when a child inherits multiple variations in specific dementia genes from both mom and dad. In some cases, not all of the parent\u2019s dementia genes will be passed on to the child. Having a family history of any type of dementia\u2014including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or Lewy body dementia (LBD)\u2014does not necessarily mean a child will eventually develop that type of dementia.\n\nWhen certain types of dementias, like FTD, are inherited, it\u2019s often a result of a single, specific inherited genic risk factor.\n\nWith Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), however, husbands and wives may each carry a gene that increases their risk of the disease but neither has ever had symptoms. When they pass these genes on to their children , symptoms may not appear unless both gene variants are present. This is because Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are complex and are more commonly associated with multiple factors working together to increase your risk."}
{"text": "Question: What is sleep apnea and how effective is surgery in treating it? \n ### Answer: Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person\u2019s breathing is interrupted during sleep. It is a serious condition that can lead to a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\n\nThere are two main types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). OSA is the most common type and is caused by a blockage in the airway. CSA is less common and is caused by a problem with the brain\u2019s ability to control breathing.\n\nSurgery can be an effective treatment for sleep apnea, especially for people with OSA. The most common type of surgery for OSA is called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This surgery removes excess tissue from the back of the throat to enlarge the airway.\n\nOther types of surgery for OSA include:\n\n-Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy: These surgeries remove the tonsils and adenoids, which can block the airway.\n\n-Tracheostomy: This surgery creates a hole in the neck to bypass the blocked airway.\n\n-Maxillomandibular advancement: This surgery moves the upper and lower jaws forward to enlarge the airway.\n\nSurgery is not always effective in treating sleep apnea. In some cases, the condition may return after surgery. In other cases, the surgery may not be successful in improving the person\u2019s breathing.\n\nIf you have sleep apnea, talk to your doctor about whether surgery is right for you.\n\n## What is the most effective surgery for sleep apnea?\n\nThere are a number of different surgeries that can be performed to treat sleep apnea. The most effective surgery for sleep apnea is the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This surgery is performed to remove the uvula and excess tissue from the back of the throat. This surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia and takes about an hour to complete.\n\n## What is the most effective treatment for sleep apnea?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the most effective treatment for sleep apnea will vary depending on the individual\u2019s specific condition.

{"text": "Question: How much urine does an average human bladder hold, in fluid oz., cups or milliliters (ml)? \n ### Answer: It\u2019s a surprisingly complicated question.\n\nHere are the results of two major studies^{1, 2}:\n\nThere were big differences in male urine capacity between different reports. It seems evident that a lot of factors could affect bladder size, such as bladder condition, carrying excess weight and other conditions (diabetes, alcoholism, hypertension). Yet another study showed that body build is another relevant factor, with taller and more muscular people having larger bladders.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBladder size depends on how much fluids you consumed. Drink 3 liters of water and your bladder will be full. It eventually empties itself. So, rather than a definite bladder capacity, it would be fairer to define a full bladder as the amount of fluids you consumed.\n\n## How much urine should I drink per day?\n\nA one liter per day is not uncommon. But depending on your height, intake of salty foods and caffeinated drinks, it may be less or more.\n\n## Bladder Size and Voids\n\nThe rule seems to be something like this. Average bladder hold is approximately 1 liter or one pint (0.56837 liters in metric). Average void is 400 to 450 ml (~2 cups). So, a normal person (i.e. not a hydrohero) should urinate every 4 to 5 hours.\n\nA bladder will fill itself but it\u2019s also designed to gauge its amount with sensors that tell your brain to empty itself. But bladder sensors aren\u2019t 100% accurate. Light voiding and delayed voiding can help people pee less often.\n\nUrinary frequency depends not only on your bladder volume, but also on your bladder\u2019s relation to your kidneys and how much you consume. Like me, some people drink fluids (and solid food) at the same pace rather than binge drinking water and filling their bladder quickly. For example, if you are an asymptomatic light social indlier you might pee only once in a night and few times a day.\n\nIf you reply to How much urine does an average human bladder hold, in fluid oz., cups or milliliters (ml"}
{"text": "Question: How does one taper off the drug Amlodipine and start Atenolol to avoid adverse side effects? \n ### Answer: Amlodipine can be gradually withdrawn until stopped in 1 or 2 weeks and the drug Atenolol started immediately.\n\nHow soon will this transition be complete?\n\nThe time to complete this will depend on the individual subject in most cases. As with most drugs, the time will be shortened if the change is not to a significantly different kind of therapy, and if directly comparable tablets can be used. With amlodipine the ideal practice would be to reduce the dose from 1 week to 1 month, but in some cases it may be necessary to reduce the tablets more. In some cases, amlodipine may tolerate long term use, although these cases are definitely not the norm. For atenolol, it is generally preferred that such people have their regimens changed gradually. However, in some cases in which a significant amount is gained for each tablet, it may be preferable to use a short-term dose of atenolol and gradually reduce the dose of amlodipine to achieve a long term benefit.\n\nAt what point will my doctor inform me that I should begin Amlodipine to replace Atenolol?\n\nAfter the first visit, a doctor may prescribe a medication for you that is labeled as \u2018Amlodipine.\u2019 This is considered a generic medication. The physician has made the decision to prescribe you this medication, believing that there are still some advantages to it over the generic medications. However, you should ask your health care provider to provide any decision concerning the specific type and the potential dosage of the drug as soon as possible. This prescription will likely include the generic name of amlodipine for each type and the potential doses for that specific drug. The doses for different types of drugs can often vary significantly, so it is important to discuss the general recommendations for each drug with your doctor to ensure that all options have been thoroughly researched and considered before making any decisions.\n\nDo you know what brands of Amlodipine are available?\n\nYou may have heard of the brand name Amladipine from your doctor as it is the generic brand of a popular generic brand called Amlodipine. This is a generic brand that has many manufacturers that make Amlodipine. To be certain you get quality quality of medicine you may want to choose a brand name in which you are interested."}

{"text": "Question: What are the causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia? Are there long-term pulmonary sequelae? Can marrying your cousin cause this? \n ### Answer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare birth defect that occurs in 1 in 2,500 live births. It is characterized by a defect in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. This defect allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, compressing the lungs and making it difficult for the baby to breathe.\n\nThe exact cause of CDH is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors include chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, and single-gene mutations, such as those that cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Environmental factors include maternal smoking, alcohol use, and exposure to certain medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n\nCDH can also be associated with other birth defects, such as heart defects, spinal cord defects, and kidney defects. In some cases, CDH may be caused by a genetic mutation that is passed down from one or both parents.\n\nLong-term pulmonary sequelae of CDH include chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory failure. These complications can lead to lifelong respiratory problems and a decreased quality of life.\n\nMarrying your cousin can increase the risk of having a child with a genetic disorder, including CDH. This is because cousins share a greater proportion of their genes than unrelated individuals, which increases the likelihood of inheriting a genetic mutation that causes CDH. However, the risk of having a child with CDH is still low, even if both parents are cousins.\n\nIn conclusion, CDH is a rare birth defect that can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It can be associated with other birth defects and can lead to long-term pulmonary sequelae.

The directions say it needs to be refrigerated .\n? \n ### Answer: Dear Nicole,\n\nYou are correct that calcitonin salmon nasal spray needs to be refrigerated between uses. Refrigerating the medication will help maintain product efficacy and potency.  I contacted the manufacturer Rbx Pharmaceuticals and learned that calcitonin salmon nasal spray should be stored in the refrigerator at two degrees to eight degrees Celsius (36-46 degrees Fahrenheit). The manufacturer recommended that calcitonin salmon nasal be used immediately after taking it out of the refrigerator and unused spray be discarded after 24 hours.\n\nAs a precaution, you may opt to store your medication in a small thermoelectric refrigerator or small portable refrigerator. You may use one that can be powered by batteries, like the portable refrigerator by Mission. Doing so may help you prevent the medication from going expired during the earthquake. After all, you may never know what will happen next.\n\nI hope I was able to address your concerns,\n\nDr. Amy Bae, Chief of Pain Medicine\nUSC Spine Center\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nO.R.7"}
{"text": "Question: I want information on Schmorl's nodes.? \n ### Answer: I fell on my butt and now have pain in my spine and low back.? It doesn't seem \"normal\" to have only a sprain.? I wish I hadn't read that it takes about 18 months to repair the spine. ?Also, if I re-injured it would be at risk permanent damage to my spine? What can I do to speed up recovery??\n\nLet me say at the outset that vertebral endplate fractures, mostly when they involve the narrow anterior part of the endplate, are known as Schmorl's nodes (also Schmorl's nodules).\n\nThe nodes or nodules are a source of some discomfort and tenderness, but mostly the pain accompanying them is attributed to the concomitant damage to surrounding structures, namely the posterior endplate and other more superficially located soft tissues.\n\nIt is true that such lesions may result in permanent weakness of bones and that may be a factor that needs to be taken into account. One fact that is worth knowing is that school age gymnasts are prone to suffer from this condition (often on the part of the back).\n\nWith all that being said, I will also share with you an excerpt from my book Fundamentals of Cervical and Lumbar Disorders (in 3 parts).\n\nVertebral fracture is denoted by disruption of the ribs surrounding one or more vertebrae of the cervical and lumbar spine. This type of injury often has a justifiable cause, for example jumping off a tall building and landing on the ground on the buttocks. However, jumping from a chest of drawers onto the floor or even tripping over a dog and landing on the buttocks, falling down the stairs, landing on the floor with the knees or the trunk may also cause vertebral fractures.\n\nThe real reason the patient was admitted was described as 'lingering head pain'. The symptoms had occurred several weeks following injury. The patient, a thirty-three-year-old firefighter, had been on nightshift for several days. He had been drinking (20-25 pints) and hardly slept. We were told that on several other occasions before this one, when he had had too much to drink, an accident followed\u2014another reason to suspect head injury.\n\nAfter"}

{"text": "Question: What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child? \n ### Answer: Hereditary rickets is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme that converts vitamin D to its active form. This mutation results in a deficiency of vitamin D, which is necessary for the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus from the diet. Without enough vitamin D, the bones become soft and weak, leading to rickets.\n\nThe likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child depends on the type of mutation that is present. If the mutation is autosomal recessive, then both parents must be carriers of the mutation in order for the child to inherit the disorder. If the mutation is autosomal dominant, then only one parent needs to be a carrier in order for the child to inherit the disorder.\n\nThe severity of the symptoms of hereditary rickets can vary depending on the type of mutation that is present. Some people with the disorder may have mild symptoms, while others may have more severe symptoms. In general, people with hereditary rickets are at risk for developing bone deformities, fractures, and other complications.\n\nIf you are concerned that you or your child may have hereditary rickets, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis. Treatment for the disorder typically involves taking vitamin D supplements and avoiding foods that are high in phosphorus. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct bone deformities.\n\n## What is the likelihood of a child with rickets passing it on to their children?\n\nRickets is a condition that results in soft, weak bones. It is most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. Rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D, which is necessary for the body to absorb calcium.\n\nThere are a number of ways that a child with rickets can pass the condition on to their children. The most common way is through the mother\u2019s milk. If the mother has rickets, her milk will not contain enough vitamin D to help the baby\u2019s bones grow properly.\n\nAnother way that rickets can be passed on is through the father\u2019s sperm. If the father has rickets, his sperm will not contain enough vitamin D to help the baby\u2019s bones grow properly.\n\nFin"}

Patients that has this SNP needs to be aware of the risk and monitor levels of homocysteine in the blood. Lee Evel\u2019s analysis follows.\n\nThe SNP A1298C is caused by a Cytosine to adenine replacement mutation at the 1298 position along the DNA strand in the 5 prime untranslated region of the MTHFR gene c. A1298C substitution leads to a change from arginine to glutamine at position 429 along the amino acid. A1298C nucleotide substitution can not only affect amino acid sequence of methyleneetrahydrofolate reductase to indirectly affect methionine production but may also affect the regulation of the gene expression in humans. Enzyme methyleneetrahydrofolate reductase plays an important role in regulating one carbon metabolic pathways and homocysteine metabolism. Significantly lower serum folate, high levels of homocysteine, lower methionine may directly affect the occurrence and process of arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease. (for more read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polate#Serum_e._ryphotoxic_levels)\n\nAlthough some studies have not concluded a high incidence of this SNP in patients with cardiovascular disease, and the fact that the SNP could not be found in patients with coronary heart disease and other studies showed that this SNP was found in10 patients with coronary heart disease and in 29 patients without coronary artery disease; suggesting that it may play a significant role in coronary heart disease."}

{"text": "Question: What are the chances that a person with CVID, who also has a thyroid tumor, will get cancer? \n ### Answer: Every person comes in different. But let us just talk about the fact that an immune system that is compromised as that created by CVID means that a person with CVID is almost always diagnosed with autoimmune diseases. That is, of course, a separate issue as well. You are in the sense that you are a regular patient who have an autoimmune disease, nothing else. The thyroid gland facilitates body functions such as menstruation, hormone production, regulation of heartbeat, and also has a fairly large role in determining the metabolic rate of a person. That is why when your body produces too much of the hormone known as T3 and T4 Thyroid hormone, the metabolic rate of your body actually increases."}
{"text": "Question: What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body? \n ### Answer: \u200b\n\nOut of all the types of diabetes, type 2, also known as \u201cadult-onset diabetes\u201d, is the most common. It affects how the body processes glucose and often leads to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the body\u2019s inability to use insulin effectively to allow glucose from the blood to move into the cell to be utilized for energy. This forces the cells to become dependent upon other methods to fuel glucose intake. The pancreas then usually responds by producing more insulin, and as more glucose is obtained, it often times becomes difficult for the body to keep up with it. When insufficient energy can be provided to fuel the body, weakness may occur, as well as fatigue on a regular basis. The attributes your body endures from type 2 diabetes can generally depend on how well you respond to your treatment plan. Some never fully conquer it, while others are able to get or stay in remission with proper treatment and taking steps to prevent it.\n\nType 1 diabetes mainly affects children and young adults because Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas becomes damaged and stops producing insulin on its own. This causes high levels of glucose in the blood, which over time can damage the eyes, heart, kidneys, nerves and other organs. Hence, having good blood glucose control can lower the risk of serious complications and can help prevent the disease altogether.\n\nGestational diabetes happens when pregnant women can\u2019t make enough insulin for themselves and the baby. Blood sugar levels usually return to normal after pregnancy but women who have this kind of diabetes are more likely to get type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\nAnother type of diabetes is called prediabetes. It occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Some people who have prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 3 years. If managed through proper treatment, it can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by half!\n\nSo what kind of symptoms do they all usually present with?\n\n\u200b\n\nThe most common diabetes symptom of them all is frequent urination. This happens because high blood sugar levels can trigger your kidneys to produce extra urine. As a result, you\u2019re forced to pee more often. Once little to no insulin is properly produced it then turns to type"}

Generally, for people at increased risk for liver complications -- those who have diabetes or excessive alcohol use -- lipid tests should be repeated one to two weeks following their first filling of the prescription. For individuals who have normal lab values, repeat testing may be done at six months and on a yearly basis, depending on your doctor\u2019s orders.\n\nSeveral factors other than liver function may increase the likelihood of statin-induced muscle disease to occur.

{"text": "Question: Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit? \n ### Answer: Osteoporosis is the reason why bones become weak and susceptible to fracture. Characterised by a decrease in bone mass and density, it mostly affects the hips, wrists and spine. For those who have suffered a fracture, there is decreased bone strength, but it cannot be identified by the absence of pain. There is a risk of repeated fractures. Persons with osteoporosis have a decreased calcium content in their bones. As such, an increase in calcium is usually a good message to give, to those who have osteoporosis. Calcium supplementation has been recommended to support the protection of bone tissue. But, there may be concerns that the calcium may be collected elsewhere; if too much calcium is absorbed, it can be stored in tissues such as the arteries, and cause damage. Regardless, calcium supplementation with vitamin D may benefit and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. The D recommended as supplementation is 800-1,000 IU/day.\n\nSecretion of the hormone calcitonin may also be beneficial for bone quality. Some persons have mutations in the calcitonin gene, which have been associated with decreased bone mass, and increased fracture frequency.\n\nThe other concern with calcium is that it may be deposited in kidney tissue. Some persons who have had renal calculi removal procedures, have what professionals call technical term \"calcium phosphate deposition\". This calcium phosphate deposit may not be evident in x-rays. The use of a low-calcium diet and certain calcium phosphate chelators have been recommended for prevention of recurrence.\n\nMagnesium salts are also used to make \"laxatives\". I would be concerned with the addition of magnesium for disordered bowel function when calcium has already been shown to have been already absorbed and deposited in unwanted places.\n\nThe amount of calcium recommended should not be taken single-handedly, while taking 1,500mg/day of magnesium citrate added on. Rather, it may be advisable to boost calcium with foods rich in calcium, like dark green vegetables, dairy products, and nuts."}

It can cause high blood pressure in some metformin users since the medication lowers glucose levels in the body. However, these associations are not solid as the treatment is effective for a myriad of health conditions \u2013 blood pressure included.\n\nDuring this article, we will discuss how metformin causes higher blood pressure for specific individuals and how as a whole, metformin treatment manages pre-diabetic and diabetic conditions.\n\n## What Makes Metformin Effective for Blood Pressure?\n\nAs metformin is an antihyperglycemic, its primary job is to improve blood glucose levels in the body as a nutritional treatment. However, there are advantages that stir from lower glucose levels in the body. Let\u2019s discuss the relationship between blood glucose levels and blood pressure.\n\n### Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure\n\nToo many health problems and illnesses date back to excess inflammation in the body. Having high blood glucose levels in the body can lead to blood vessel damage, heart disease and the onset of diabetes. However, high blood glucose levels can also produce inflammation and create an interference in the kidneys.\n\nThis can lead to a lot of salt and water retention in the body. With excess fluid and salt in the body, there will eventually be damaging impacts on the cardiovascular system. Hence, blocking excess sodium and fluid helps with ambulatory blood pressure and can reduce the chances of heart and kidney disease.\n\n### Metformin Effects on Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure\n\nA study published in Diabetes Care highlights the impacts of low-intensity prescribed training and isometric heavy-resistance exercises on individuals with otherwise uncontrolled blood pressure on metformin.

{"text": "Question: Can cancer spread through blood contact? \n ### Answer: Below I share my viewpoint and research findings \u2026\n\nMore specifically: no, cancer cannot spread anywhere through blood contact.\n\nBut first, why do people ask if cancer can spread through blood contact?\n\nCancer occurs because of disruptions in our normal cellular process. Even in the absence of cancer, our blood contains millions of such cells that regenerate, which is how a tooth pull or a cut heals. But this regenerative process involves precise instructions, some of which cancer uses to its advantage and make the same, abnormal cells. This causes uncontrolled growth, creating new and often \u201cdifferent\u201d malignant cells.\n\nThis process of cancer is unique to each patient, in other words, the source of the abnormal cells in your brain may have the same signature as the cancer in many other people (e.g., breast cancer), but it\u2019s different because each source is different. Now, if a cell is removed (say, via a biopsy), it starts to grow on other people and create a new cancer there. That is one easy way cancer may spread through blood \u2013 via swapping sources for the \u201csame kind\u201d cancer that was not there but starts to grow once cells from source cancer begin to grow on other people.\n\nBut is this how cancer typically spreads?\n\nMy view is: not at all. Below let\u2019s see why \u2026\n\n## Mechanics Of Blood Flow In A Human Body\n\nWhen you say blood, you have to think blood flow! That is, the blood inside your body is, by and large, flowing through your arteries and veins.\n\nWhen you ask if cancer can spread through blood contact, I assume (correct me if I am wrong) by blood contact you really mean blood flow since you exclude direct contact.\n\nUnless you place a blood bag in your skin, you cannot begin to think of, say, touching a blood vessel, and allow your blood to flow there. It\u2019s either you couple a capillary or get severely injured to see any effect, and the consequences won\u2019t be as trivial as a mere spread of cancer cells (here statistic for contaminating blood from blood bags).\n\nThe diameter of a blood vessel is something like 3 millimeters for a big artery, that\u2019s a little thinner than a pencil.\n\nAssuming one would surpass the artery\u2019s protection, that"}
{"text": "Question: What is plantar fasiciitis, and how is it treated? \n ### Answer: Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain. It is caused by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot. The plantar fascia connects the heel bone to the toes and helps support the arch of the foot.\n\nPlantar fasciitis is often caused by overuse or repetitive stress on the plantar fascia. This can happen when you walk, run, or stand for long periods of time. It can also be caused by wearing shoes that don\u2019t fit well or don\u2019t provide enough support.\n\nSymptoms of plantar fasciitis include pain in the heel or arch of the foot, especially when you first get out of bed in the morning. The pain may also be worse after standing or walking for long periods of time.\n\nTreatment for plantar fasciitis usually involves rest, ice, and stretching exercises. You may also need to wear special shoes or orthotics to help support your feet. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to release the tight plantar fascia.\n\nIf you think you may have plantar fasciitis, it\u2019s important to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Early treatment can help prevent the condition from getting worse.\n\n## What is plantar fasciitis?\n\nPlantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain.

A recent study of nearly 44,000 cancer patients showed that the jaw bones can often hold cancers of other organs within them.\n\n## What causes teeth to abscess?\n\nDental problems can have various common causes, such as dental crowns (also called persian anchors) and surgical implants in the teeth which have been done repeatedly or for a long period of time. Other causes can be tooth decay, loss of vitamin D from a disease such as rickets, and even seizures and cancer.\n\nWhat can I expect in test results after my tooth abscess is detected?\n\nAn abscess tooth can cause your abdominal area to become swollen or painful as an oral abscess forms in the upper part of your body or just below the gumline where they pain is located. An abscess tooth can sometimes be treated or cured for a period of time before an abscess can develop. There is often a link between an abscess, especially in the mouth, with other oral problems such as diabetes mellitus, gum disease and tooth decay, which can either cause or aggravate a tooth abscess in the mouth.\n\n## How to tell if you have an abscess in your tooth:\n\nThere are several ways to tell if you have an abscess developing in your mouth. An abscess can form either because it is located in the jaw bone, mouth tissue, or even upper or lower part of your time than what is visible in the mouth. If you are an older person with a mouth that is in good condition, you may be able to identify some of these common features to look for.\n\nSome of these features are also indicators of other conditions in the mouth such as mouth sores, sore throat pain in the mouth, discoloration in the mouth, or bad breath in the mouth.

These supplements are added with food and are often prescribed if there are any vitamin deficiency symptoms observed.\n\nSo by adding these in your diet, you can add up the daily nutrients with a balanced diet. This is the basic aim these co-enzymes are designed for.\n\nCoenzymes are often available as powder format in bottles in combination with vitamins and other nutritional supplements to enrich our diet in the right way. Many supplements are available today claiming of treating some specific illness but they actually work when you are having proper food.\n\nFor Muslims, these coenzymes are considered as food that are not haram under sharia law anyway. So in this case, there won\u2019t be any conflict of law as we consider these as food only. Vitamins, in general, are also counted as food and these are bona fide."}
{"text": "Question: What doctor specializes in testing for and treating autoimmune diseases? \n ### Answer: Autoimmune specialists focus on diagnosing and treating your symptoms, relieving your pain, and helping you learn to cope with autoimmune problems. In many cases, an autoimmune doctor will work in cooperation with your primary care doctor to manage your condition.\n\nDo autoimmune diseases need a specialist? Your immune system helps you fight infection. With autoimmune disease, your immune system may mistakenly attack parts of your body, such as tissues or organs. Autoimmune diseases can be difficult to diagnose. This is because the signs and symptoms may vary from person to person.\n\nHow do you treat an autoimmune disease?\n\nIncrease Flavonoids in Your Diet\n\nFlavonoid-rich foods are associated with a lower risk of autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (5,6). Flavonoids are antioxidants that act as a first line of defense against free radicals that damage DNA and may trigger inflammation.\n\nDo autoimmune diseases affect your whole body?

{"text": "Question: How long has Non-aspirin NSAID been implicated in erectile dysfunction? \n ### Answer: Long enough to be of interest. Two studies seem to be associated with this problem. One is a fourteen study meta analysis and the other is a five population cohort study [1], one objective, one subjective. Many randomized controlled trials showed little relationship.\n\nThe earlier meta analysis noted that when adjusted for factors confounding studies, odd ratio for Non-aspirin NSAID was 1.37, CI 1.15\u20131.62. [2]\n\nWhat else is known to be associated with ED?\n\nDiabetes \u2014>Probably. Diabetes is a risk factor for ED [3]. NSAID are known to cause diabetes [2, 4].\n\nOpiates \u2014> Very definite. [2]\n\nHypothyroidism \u2014> some evidence. [2]\n\nWhat are the limitations of these studies?\n\n1. In several studies, relationships observed were marginal.\n2. How relevant are subjective observations as opposed to objective measurements?\na.     in one of the cohort studies, even when adjusted, occasional use of NSAID was associated with risk  (@ 1.6).\n\nRegimen: Statins, by negating loss of endothelium integrity, have been shown to restore erectile function [5].\n\nRisk factor modification in male patients with erectile dysfunction due to non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n\u201cAuthors\u2019 conclusions:\nEvidence of association between non-aspirin NSAIDs and ED was generally strong, though effect sizes were smaller when randomized controlled trials were taken into consideration. This is probably because randomized controlled trials are not necessarily well matched for their controls and have typically used large doses of NSAIDs to enhance potential for demonstrating effects. Additional adjusted analysis of RCTs of NSAIDs on erectile function will be required to strengthen the confidence in this association.\u201d (See references #2-5 for complete references)."}
{"text": "Question: What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it? \n ### Answer: \u2014S.\n\nAortic stenosis, also called aortic valve stenosis, is a condition in which the blood-flow in or out of the heart is blocked due to a narrowed aortic valve. The aortic valve is a critical organ through which the chambers of the heart (ventricles) pump blood into the extra 7 billions capillaries throughout the body that carry nutrients to all the cells.\n\nA normal aortic valve has three leaflets.  A well-working aortic valve is also able to adapt its size to the amount of blood being pumped out by the heart.\n\nAortic stenosis is caused by a narrowed aortic valve and can occur for various reasons. These include:\n\n- Calcification, in which calcium is secreted in the leaflets of the valve, (the affected segments get stiffer)\n- Genetic defects that in the ability of the valve\u2019s internal leaflets to adapt\n- Problems with a heart valve from a previous heart operation or congenital heart disease (birth defects).\n- Structural problems (Various reasons such as infectious processes, mitral valve prolapse, and rheumatic fever are found to possess risk for aortic stenosis later in life)\n\nAs aortic stenosis progresses the body will adjust by speeding up the heart rate to compensate. The heart will often beat erratically to increase the output of blood-flow through what is available. Symptoms of aortic stenosis include exercise limitation, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, palpitations (irregular or pounding heart beat), and fainting episodes.\n\nThe hardness of the calcification narrowing in aortic stenosis will take time to develop. Procedures can be done to widen the narrowed valve or even replace the defective valve. Depending on the degree of heart failure, patients who can not get better can urgently require an emergency operation to prevent death.\n\nAortic stenosis is best identified \u201caccidentally\u201d through medical screening procedures, electrocardiograms (ECGs) or echocardiograms (ultrasound heart scan).

Protect from light.\n\nWhat happens when a medication out-of-date?\n\nYou are extentually unlikely to get a huge difference between the available benefits/risks of an expired drug and one that is up to date.\n\nWhat is best before?\n\nGlobal production standards provide a time frame to guarantee effective product stabilty, sell-by dates give predictable time after production to the customer. Medicines are stable up until the supplied expiry dates. Drug products impituos-to use at labels or stated date in their bottles.\n\nWhen does a drugs expire?\n\nAll medications, whether otc or prescription, can be out of date and be unsuitable for use, just based on the expiration date. If medications are exposed to high tepratures where destruction may happen, it may cause lower stability of active ingredient and efficacy, asd well as minimize safety."}
